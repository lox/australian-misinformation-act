To whom it may concern,

I wish to object to and express my deepest concerns about your Misinformation Bill.

If anyone was guilty of misinforming and disinformation people it would be our government.

What this bill seeks to do is to restrict our freedom of speach, undermine our democratic processes and punish those
who dare to express the views different to the narrative the current government is pushing. It is no different than if we
were living under Hitler or Stalin regime.

It is outmost important, for any democracy, to have people who freely and respectfully express their views, debate
and discuss different topics. That is how we, as a nation, grow and improve.

The Bill will put Australia into the dark ages, where only what government of the day say- goes.

Our democracy trives when our citizens actively engage in its processes, which means having different opinions and
not agreeing on every point.

What the Bill seeks to do is to impose the totalitarianism and dictatorship, silencing any descending voices.

The Bill seeks to impose a new system of government, simmilar yo fascism. And we all know what happened during
Hitler's and Stalin's era. Do not ruin our beautiful country with your Misinformation Bill.

Regards

Abby
