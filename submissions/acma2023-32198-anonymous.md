**REJECTION OF PROPOSED BILL OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION**

I am concerned that the Government is taking a step down the path of Totalitarian Government,
Communism, and a Dictatorship where there only a freedom of speech that fits their narrative of
Truth of the Government. No Government should be the authority on defining Truth. No
Government should limit freedom of speech according to their rule and definition of Truth. The
Government and Mainstream Media would be exempt from the rules of the bill. Therefore, there
would be: No Government Accountability, No Freedom of Speech, No Democracy, No Human Rights.
We don't need the Labor Government arbitrating truth as there will be no open debate. The
A.C.M.A. would be the Governments Watchdog and surveillance on the people of Australia by
recording all Misinformation and Disinformation because the Government has set huge financial
fines on the Mainstream Media if they don't report or act on the Governments behalf. Truth is based
on facts and should set us free, but your Bill will not set us free. I am concerned about the
Governments intentions for the People of Australia??
