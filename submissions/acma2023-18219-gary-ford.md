# New ACMA powers 2023: A Potential Threat to Free Speech and Democracy

Introduction: In an era dominated by social media platforms, the dissemination of
information has reached unprecedented levels. While social media offers numerous
benefits, it has also become a breeding ground for misinformation and
disinformation. In response, some argue that government legislation (using ACMA) is
necessary to curb this problem. However, implementing such measures poses a
serious threat to the principles of free speech and democracy, as it grants the
government/ACMA significant power to control information flow and potentially
stifle dissenting voices. This essay will explore the potential dangers associated with
government legislation aimed at limiting misinformation on social media and argue
that alternative approaches should be prioritised to safeguard free speech and
democracy.


1. The Slippery Slope of Censorship: Government intervention in regulating


social media content sets a dangerous precedent. Once the government or
government body (ACMA) acquires the authority to determine what qualifies
as misinformation, it opens the door to censorship. In a democratic society,
the exchange of diverse ideas and opinions is crucial for the development of
informed citizens. By granting the government the ability to decide what is
true and what is false, we risk falling into a slippery slope where any dissenting
viewpoint or critical analysis could be deemed as misinformation, leading to
the suppression of legitimate voices.


2. Potential for Political Bias: Government legislation to limit misinformation


introduces the risk of political bias. Governments are not immune to partisan
agendas, and their involvement in content regulation may lead to the
suppression of views that do not align with the ruling party's ideology. This
not only undermines the principle of free speech but also threatens the
essence of democracy by silencing minority voices, stifling healthy debate, and
consolidating power in the hands of the few. Protecting the right to express
diverse opinions, even if they are considered misinformation, is vital to
fostering a robust democratic discourse.


3. Technological Challenges and Overreach: Legislating against misinformation


on social media presents significant technological challenges. Misinformation
can spread rapidly across platforms, making it difficult to identify and address
in real-time. The task of distinguishing between deliberate misinformation and
genuine mistakes is complex and subjective. Government legislation, in an
attempt to regulate social media content, risks imposing burdensome
requirements on platforms, potentially stifling innovation and hindering
technological progress. Moreover, excessive government overreach into the

operations of social media platforms compromises their independence and
integrity, eroding the trust users have in them.


4. Critical thinking skills should be encouraged within the usage of social media.


The embrace of the advantages of alternative sources of information other
than mainstream media offer opportunity to up-skill intelligent discourse. So
often the downside of information overload in a noisy environment such as
twitter for example is emphasised. The skill of analysing intelligent varieties of
opinions needs to be actively developed. This will not happen within
traditional mainstream media environments.

Conclusion: While the proliferation of misinformation on social media is undoubtedly
a pressing issue, government legislation to limit it poses significant threats to free
speech and democracy. The potential for censorship, political bias, technological
challenges, and overreach highlights the dangers associated with granting the
government control over information dissemination. Instead, a balanced approach
that promotes critical thinking and intelligent use of social media should be pursued.
By empowering individuals with a new skillset, we can combat misinformation while
safeguarding the principles that underpin free speech and democracy in the digital
age.
