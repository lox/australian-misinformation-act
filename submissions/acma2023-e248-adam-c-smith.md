**Subject: I oppose the New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation**

To it may concern

I as an Australian citizen do not consent and oppose the implementation of the new powers proposed for ACMA as I have no
confidence in the government or their agencies to determine what is Misinformation and Disinformation.

The censorship is an abhorrent overreach of powers, stifling free speech and I believe politicians should not be the thought police
and this act will just be an imposition on opposing views not matching the narrative of the ruling class and governments. No to the
Ministry of Truth.

Regards,

Adam C Smith
