# Submission to the exposure draft 

## Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 Date: 16 August 2023

 I am a bus driver and this is my point of view as a private citizen with the right to participate in my democracy.

 I don’t want this law change.

 This law will censor people’s points of view.

 Do not censor people’s points of view from social media including substack, facebook, twitter, google, Instagram, rumble, and youtube,

 We need alternative viewpoints even if you think they are wrong.

 The idea that ACMA has put forward in the explanatory guidance, that people are so stupid they might inject bleach and therefore we have to be kept safe from misinformation is a total joke.

 I don’t think we need to be kept safe from misinformation.

 This is an excuse for you to grab power.

 This should be rejected outright.

 I do not support this legislation.
