My first Question is how was this publicised to the citizens of Australia to engage with? I only found
out about if from my associates and the window for consultation is only open for 6 weeks. The
government have had a much greater length of time to discuss it and debate it, so it should be more
open to public consultation and more widely publicised.

The next question who is going to assist the government bodies to make these decisions? the
government should not police the truthfulness of information on its own as they have shown they
are responsible for the same misinformation and disinformation over the past many years and not
shown their source or the information to the public.

There should always be a scrutinising force at a time when the rich and powerful are getting away
with more and more in this world, a perfect example is Facebook and twitter have already been
influenced by governments and corporations to police misinformation that I have seen firsthand with
the so called “fact check” which has proven many times to be fascicle. If you are going to leave it to
these social media outlets to police and be pressured by government, there will just be more
freedom of speech taken away. Social media has become so important for many people as it is the
only way to communicate what is going on, and because of the fact we don’t get a balanced report
from large media outlets.

The only way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to have open debate about subjects
publicly, with the clear and factual information presented, then with good balance of representation
from both sides of an argument. It is clear much of the news media is already controlled and it is rare
to see balance on major news media. I follow parliament on a regular basis from many media
sources, much of what is debated never make any large news media outlet to give a balanced view to
the majority of the Australian public and why many are turning away from it. It leaves me in doubt
that there will be equitable outcome from this bill.
