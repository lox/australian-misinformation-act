To whom it may concern,

Re: Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
**Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

I DO NOT CONSENT TO THE GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP IN THE FORM DESCRIBED IN THE
"Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023”!

In the interest of BASIC HUMANITY & FREE THINKING, & in accordance with My Personal Beliefs of
RATIONAL SELF INTEREST, FREE WILL, HUMAN REASONING, FREE SPEECH & LIBERTIES;

I believe that "we" NEED to be able to talk, discuss and resolve issues with EVERYBODY; including
THOSE we disagree with, who have opinions opposite to "us”, and who may even misinform &/or
disinform us.

**Censorship or cancelling people's voices due to your opinion of "misinformation or**
**disinformation" IS NOT the answer!**

**Censorship or cancelling people's voices due to your fears of a "PERCEIVED" threat to me (or my**
**fellow Australians) safety and well-being:**

**i) IS NOT the answer**

**ii) IS NOT your job or responsibility**

**iii) Threatens to DESTROY MORE THAN IT AIMS TO PROTECT!!**

Censoring ideas & speech by labelling it misinformation or disinformation is an Evil & Orwellian
**notion; which should be opposed, fought & killed-off whenever it is raised by those in positions of**
power, influence & control.

It may start out with Good intention....BUT....history shows us it eventually leads to Tyranny of a
general population & the loss of a society’s many voices (and freedoms).

I DO NOT CONSENT TO GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP IN ANY FORM, this includes
LAWS/RECOMMENDATIONS/ADVICE on what is MISINFORMATION.....!!

**What I NEED MY GOVERNMENT TO DO IS.........Just tell me what "WAS" said and I’ll decide what’s**
**misinformation.**


-----

This arrogance of "government” or anybody for that matter, knowing what misinformation is
regarding "a subject matter"......IS

1) AN INSULT TO ALL INDEPENDENT THINKING AUSTRALIAN MEN & WOMEN

AND

2) TRUELY UN-AUSTRALIAN.

Thank you for taking “My say” into consideration.

**Regards & let’s keep Orwell's "1984" a novel, Kill this Bill, and NOT let this notion become part of**
**ANY Australian Law.**
