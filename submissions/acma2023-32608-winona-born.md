# Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Dear Information Integrity Section,

I oppose the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. Some of my concerns include that:

  - If passed, this Bill would undermine the right to freedom of speech, enshrined in the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

  - The definition of ‘harm’ is far too broad and vague.

  - There is a threat to privacy in the powers that ACMA would be given to compel owners of digital

platforms to provide information and evidence about misinformation and disinformation.

  - The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of

censorship powers.

Please abandon this Bill. Democracy and the good of Australian society will not be upheld by such broad
and vaguely defined powers over the sharing of information.

Yours sincerely,

Winona Born
