Dear ACMA,

I write as an Australian citizen on behalf of all freedom loving Australians to register my disgust and
protest concerning the Communications (Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill released for
comment by the Albanese Labor Government, proposing to empower ACMA to grossly and
undemocratically interfere with our fights to free speech by giving them the authority to determine
what is truth and what isn’t on social media while allowing Labor and politicians to be exempt from
such regulations.

This is a gross violation of individual civil rights, democratic freedoms and good governance and
must be stopped.

All Australians should be free to speak truth to power, not merely one agency’s self-determined
truth approved by those put in power by the people who are, by definition, going to be prejudiced
against the views and beliefs of a great many of Australians who hold views different to their own.

If this Bill is passed it will lead to the loss of all the things you yourselves are privileged to enjoy
including your own freedoms because as history has proved, the result will be tyranny, calamity and
ruin.

Yours sincerely

MICHELLE C PITT
