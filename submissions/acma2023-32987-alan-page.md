**An** **introduction:**
The Albanese government’s Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is another dangerous lurch down the path to totalitarianism which all
Australians should oppose. The bill gives the government power to regulate “truth” online by being
able to force social media platforms to censor “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is
“harmful”—three vague terms that are open to very broad interpretation.

While it is awful that this Aust federal govt should propose eroding Australian's right to free speech,
it leaves the door open for a future apocrophal govt or dictator to employ this tool to carry on the
nefarious censorship we've experience during 3 years of covid (2020-23), which incidentally has
transferred seemlessly into dividing the world and killing hundreds of thousands of Ukranians for
military industrial complex gain, limiting global energy and fertiliser supplies, causing military
build ups in europe and Asia (dverting funds from education, infrastructure, socal welfare, etc).

This article is elaborated on further into my document, but shows that a US court has ruled against
the US govt for censoring discussion (in millions of cases) of medical approaches other than the
govt's 'Narrative' during the covid era. 9'6'23 article: **Slaying** **the** **Censorship** **Leviathan.** **Our**
**Missouri** **v.** **Biden** **court** **case** exposes the government-led information war to censor what
Americans think. AARON KHERIATY, MD. **[<https://aaronkheriaty.substack.com/p/slaying-](https://aaronkheriaty.substack.com/p/slaying-the-censorship-leviathan)**
**the-censorship-leviathan>.**

Mussloini described fascism as the merger of state and corporate power. That is appropriate to
reflect how the Pharma industry captured govt regulators (Aust's TGA is 96% pharma funded), and
had govt force covid vaccines on the population      - in blatant disregard for the Nuremberg code,
subjecting millions to a medical experiment using the dubiously tested vaccines, and a horrible
crime against humanity. See references section at end of this document: a, b & c.

### If you doubt me, at least 25,000 vaccine deaths are recorded in the US CDC's Vaccine Adverse
Events Reporting System (VAERS), which a 2011 Harvard study found only captured 1-3% of
vaccine injuries. The European medicines agency has at least 65,000 vaccine deaths recorded. The
medical establishment is so cowed by the censorship and character assasination being applied from
the top down, that few are willing to question or object to what's been occurring. Mainstream and
social media are coordinated in enforcing a covid narrative, and denying alternative views. This is
clearly harmful, as the vaccinations have proven neither safe nor effective. If they offered durable
protection, would we be passing this third year with covid still doing the rounds? The virus mutates
quicker than pharma can create adaptive vaccines, let alone test them properly before deployment.

### Reference D (at end of doc): "A 15'10'21 article. Is there evidence that natural exposure immunity to COVID virus is similar or superior to vaccine-induced immunity, and should we force/mandate these vaccines on our healthy military and police?" is instructive. It lists 70 studies that showed in Oct 2021, natural immunity to covd was a thing. And yet the government, mainstream and social media continued in the following year to disparage it, and force vaccination to enlarge Pharma profits at the potential expense of death and illness in a proportion of those mandated to vax. This was blatant gaslighting of the population by govt and industry, so no I don't have faith in an Australian govt bill to censor media, and excpress my grave concern that such censorhip legislation is currently proposed in Ireland the the US. My feeling is that Aust is being sold out to transnational interests, at least


-----

### partially centred in the US; but with fascist influence from Europe evident. Why is Aust govt importing this blatantly corrosive influence to undermine our personal freedoms and liberties; going against what our parents fought for in WW2? Importing this censorship model into Australia signals that our sovereignty is being handed to forces outside Australia, which I find despicable.

 The Bill says: 'The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed
from digital platform services'. The puts the onus on service providers to censor their client, to
avoid fines and penalties.

### The govt's proposed censorship, once applied, would see aired public opinions self- censorsed in order to avoid being taken down, person being de-platformed, de-financialised, etc. This is a degree of magnitude worse than direct censorship. It is a stifle to freedom of expression. 'Follow the science' Dr Fauci used to declare. Science is about asking questions, and gathering data to back up one's hypothesis. The censorship of 2020-2023 across Western countries was antithical to scientific method and spirit, and cost our societies greatly: billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives (recording was dodged when possible).

 China engaged in heavy surveillance and lockdown during this period, failed to eradicate Covid, and now has a smoking ruin trend in its economy. With tight social media control, and an aversion to criticism of govt, China faces intractable difficulties; because problems are not spoken nor acknowledge.

 A useful June 2023 quote from Dr Pierre Kory, “Notably, journalism — the filter through which ordinary people living busy lives come to understand the complex matrix of power, money, and influence — has also been exposed for its bizarre servility to public health decrees and pharmaceutical companies”.

'There is no authority to truth. Just discovery of new truths in an endless onion-layered universe. If
### your point of view is so good, then be the man in the arena with it. Present your idea openly and with vulnerability. Permit scrutiny. Allow for criticism. Denounce censorship. And display it with utter transparency - including who funded your research and all conflicts of interest. Call out the intellectual cowards who try to silence discourse with censorship', Nullius in Verba, 5'7'22.

 There’s a reason the American founding fathers enshrined freedom of speech in the US Constitution. It’s the same reason that Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia in 1948 helped to draft, states: “Everyone has the right to freedom
## of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference
### and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” When governments contrive pretexts to limit speech, they are lurching down the dangerous path to totalitarianism.

Ivermectin "horse dewormer,” making it unavailable at pharmacies, failing to report Uttar Pradesh

In the annus horribilis of 2020, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. writes in the secret history of the pandemic,

Health, “liberal democracy effectively collapsed worldwide.” Kennedy documents the unthinkable
with thousands of footnotes: “across Western nations, shell-shocked citizens experienced all the

well-worn tactics of rising totalitarianism—mass propaganda and censorship, the orchestrated
promotion of terror, the manipulation fo science, the suppression of debate, the vilification of
dissent, and the use of force to prevent protest.” It’s a masterwork, Dostoevsky’s The Demons in
nonfiction.

Matthew Crawford is a PhD in physics, a philosopher, statistician, motorcycle mechanic, and
senior research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture at the University of Virginia.
In his popular Substack Rounding the Earth Newsletter he reports that the pandemic is the Waterloo
or the Siege of Leningrad of the globalists, the tipping point conflict in the attempt of an oligarchic
technocracy to flatten and rule the Earth, and it’s the job of the rest of us to stop them.

“Like it or not, a world war is underway,” he writes, “and it has been underway for longer than most
people realize. It is the World Civil War, pitting an increasingly tyrannical ruling class against
everyone else.” It appears to be a bloodless war, except for the estimated 4.4 million people who
died needlessly (out of 5.5 million global covid deaths reported by Johns Hopkins) because Dr.
Fauci, the NIH, CDC, WHO, and a corrupted mainstream media buried not only the risks of mRNA
vaccines but the benefits of early treatments. There are dozens of safe, proven drugs and
supplements—like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine—that saved at least 80 percent of those who
had access to it, says cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough. But adoption of IVM and HCQ for covid
treatment would have collapsed the EUA for the vaccines, and driven them—and their phenomenal
profits—off the market.

Was Stalin worse? The Soviet dictator’s Ukrainian famine of 1932-33, known as the Holodomor, “a
combination of the Ukrainian words for “starvation” and “to inflict death”—claimed the lives of 3.9
million people. Has the covid-19 catastrophe been a big mistake, a simple misinterpretation of the
data by our smartest public health authorities who will do better next time? Mass murder, the crime

supporting a deeply compromised discipline which appears primarily driven by financial interests
rather than by what I had naively believed was a commitment to saving lives. I chose to not pursue
the careers of my father and father in law, which were spent building weapons of war. Only to find
that I had inadvertently played a significant role in enabling one of the most tragic medical follies in
the history of man.

they seem to find the whole thing amusing. The unnecessary lives lost, the destruction of faith in the

Leaked files reviewed by MintPress expose how intelligence services the world over can track
cryptocurrency transactions to their source and therefore identify users by monitoring the
movements of smartphone and Internet-of-Things (loT) devices, such as Amazon Echo. The
contents comprehensively detonate the myth of crypto anonymity, and have grave implications for
individuals and states seeking to shield their financial activity from the prying eyes of hostile
governments and authorities.

The documents are among a trove related to the secret operations of Anomaly 6, a shadowy private
spying firm founded by a pair of U.S. military intelligence veterans. The company covertly embeds
software development kits, or SDKs, in hundreds of popular apps, then slices through layers of
“anonymized” data in order to uncover sensitive information about any individual it chooses
anywhere on Earth, at any time. In all, Anomaly 6 can simultaneously monitor roughly three billion
smartphone devices      - equivalent to a fifth of the world’s total population      - in real-time.

Having previously hawked its wares to U.S. Special Operations Command, as this journalist
revealed on December 6, Anomaly 6 is now using British private military company Prevail Partners
# - heavily involved in the West’s proxy war in Ukraine - to market and sell its product to a variety
### of Western military, security, and intelligence agencies the world over. This is despite the
company’s own founders fearing its global dragnet could be completely illegal under national and
international data protection regimes.

Governments all over the world are using surveillance data collected on the net, and have now
expanded their reach by using COVID-19 tracking technology      - just as “conspiracy theorists” had
feared would be the case. These governments and NGOs seem to think -in a naive kind of “hope”-
that if they only have enough data, they could control the world and bend reality to their objectives.

As had been feared, it now turns out that governments are using the COVID-19 tech to follow, track
down, investigate and arrest people for reasons that have nothing to do with COVID. COVID-19
exposure, tracking and contract tracing tools have become all purpose tools for biosecurity
surveillance states.

Today, I am highlighting a few recent articles that show how these surveillance states are using
COVID-19 tech to monitor, track, investigate and arrest.

We know that the government has spent more than ten billion dollars to promote these vaccines
through social media, entertainment and news. We know that they paid to not only censor, but also
to defame.

There is only one hope for our country at this point, and that is to continue to dip into the deep well
### of wisdom from our constitution. That is what will save our country. The guardian of the integrity of our republic is the judicial system. This is why the corruption of the Department of Justice by the
deep state and the executive branch is so dangerous to our republic. We now must rely on our
judges to uphold the constitution. Let’s hope they are up to the task.

Number 10. the mainstream media tried to Gaslight us into believing the trucker Freedom Convoy
was just a bunch of racist Texas right-wing terrorist that the protest was filled with a bunchof
trump-loving white supremacists and in reality the protest which was about stopping vaccine
mandates was in Canada where people can't even vote for Trump. It was primarily organized by a
woman who they threw in jail was filled with people from all sides of the political Spectrum who
came together for the one purpose of supporting medical freedom of choice and many of whom
were not white at all.

Number 9. After years of the mainstream media pointing the finger at Ukraine for having a
legitimate Nazi problem to the point where in 2015 Congress actually passed a measure to block
Ukrainian Nazi battalions namely the azab Italian from getting U.S money and weapons suddenly
this past year the Nazis were no longer Nazis but instead just patriotic Ukrainians deserving of
billions in U.S money and weapons.

Number 8, Twitter when people claimed social media was Shadow Banning them for opinions
contrary to The Establishment liberal narrative when people claim the government was meddling
with free speech when people claimed they were being surveilled by the FBI via social media they
were called conspiracy theorists yet the Twitter files showed us they weren't conspiracies at all.

As we move through January 2023, and additional details about the lies our governments have told
us are revealed daily, I keep getting questioned about how it feels to be vindicated. I wrote about
this last year, at a time when the approved narrative appeared to be failing, and my deep
ambivalence remains. To my surprise, governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), and
various non-governmental organizations (WEF, BMGF etc.) have managed to keep the COVID
crisis alive and weaponized to justify policies which do not advance public health objectives, but
which they use to advance their own political and financial interests. Like tossing offal over the
transom, “Never let a good crisis go to waste” seems to have provoked a shark feeding frenzy which
humanity may require decades to recover from. Assuming we ever do.

     - 6'6'23. **What** **Censorship** **Leaders** **Are** **Hiding.** "Anti-disinformation" groups refuse to turn over
subpoenaed information to Congress, are canceling public workshops, and won't answer questions.
MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, 6 JUN 2023.

[<https://public.substack.eom/p/what-censorship-leaders-are-hiding >](https://public.substack.eom/p/what-censorship-leaders-are-hiding)

The people who say they are fighting disinformation appear to be transparent and trustworthy.
Groups like Stanford Internet Observatory and the Atlantic Council. But of the 50 top ’’anti­
disinformation” governmental and nongovernmental groups in the world, which Matt Taibbi’s
investigative team at Racket identified, only one has agreed to answer our questions, and only 10
even bothered responding to our repeated requests for an interview.

Last week the pro-censorship Atlantic Council’s DPR Laboratory canceled the online launch event
for its new report, “Telegram, WeChat, and WhatsApp Usage in the United States.” It might have
had something to do with the fact that, a few weeks earlier, we had tweeted critically about it,
signed up to attend, and encouraged others to join us.

Two weeks ago, BBC heavily promoted the launch of its own “anti-disinfo” program called
“Verify,” but has refused to answer questions about it or make its 27-year-old host, whose role is
apparently to fact-check all of the news, available for an interview.

And now, the lead censorship organization, Stanford Internet Observatory, is refusing to respect a
House Judiciary Committee subpoena for records in the form of “tickets” from the Jira project
management software system.

Rep. Jim Jordan said the lawyer representing Stanford had confirmed to committee staff that
Stanford Internet Observatory has documents and communications related to its “flagging” of
content for censorship by social media companies but would not give them to the members of
Congress. Why? What are Stanford Internet Observatory, Atlantic Council’s DPR Lab, BBC, and
other pro-censorship organizations hiding?

Extracts:
One year ago, I joined the states of Missouri and Louisiana and several other co-plaintiffs to file a
suit in federal court challenging what journalist Michael Shellenberger has called the censorship­
industrial complex. While much of the press cooperated with the state’s censorship efforts and has
ignored our court battle, we expect that it will ultimately go to the Supreme Court, setting
up Missouri v. Biden to be the most important free speech case of our generation—and arguably, of
the past 50 years.

Prior government censorship cases typically involved a state actor unconstitutionally meddling with
one publisher, one author, one or two books, a single article. But as we intend to prove in court, the
federal government has censored hundreds of thousands of Americans, violating the law on tens of
millions of occasions in the last several years. This unprecedented breach was made possible by the
wholly novel reach and breadth of the new digital social media landscape.

### ...a relatively unknown agency within the Department of Homeland Security became the central
clearinghouse of government-run information control—an Orwellian Ministry of Truth      -
Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency—better known as CISA.


-----

... the Department of Homeland Security unilaterally declared federal control over the country’s
election infrastructure, which had previously been administered at the local level. Not long after that,
CISA, which is a subagency of the DHS, established its own authority over the cognitive
infrastructure by becoming the central hub coordinating the government’s information control
activities.

Suppose that a federal national security agency teamed up with private research institutions, backed
by enormous resources and federal funding, to establish a mass-surveillance and mass-censorship
program that uses sophisticated techniques to review hundreds of millions of American citizens’
electronic communications in real time, and works closely with tech platforms to covertly censor
millions of them.

Former UK Ambassador Craig Murray.

<https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2023/06/assange-an-unholy-masquerade-of-tyranny-
disguised-as-justice/>

Thomas’ quote “an unholy masquerade of tyranny disguised as justice” is a phrase that has been
rattling around my head as a prefect encapsulation of the state “legal” process against Julian
Assange, which I have been detailing this last several years. Together, of course, with the fact that
the NATO states hate Assange       - and seek his judicial murder       - precisely for revealing truths that
embarrassed their system of “conquest, pillage and slaughter” in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen,
Syria and elsewhere. We are brought up with an innate respect for the rule of law and belief that,
though it makes mistakes, it is impartial and honest. Unfortunately, that is merely one of the myths
by which our society functions. That is something I have reluctantly come to understand.

I was, nonetheless, so taken aback by Justice Jonathan Swift’s current and curt ruling,
### Assange’s High Court appeal in the extradition saga, that I thought I would dig a little deeper. I therefore started with Swift’s : r , in cahoots with Judge

Lewis, that the Tory government’s scheme to deport refugees to Rwanda is lawful.

One line of Rav’s was a particularly powerful and concise articulation of what I (and all of us) have


-----

been living through in Covid in regards to the media;

“Notably, journalism — the filter through which ordinary people living busy lives come
to understand the complex matrix of power, money, and influence — has also been
exposed for its bizarre servility to public health decrees and pharmaceutical companies.”

Although I was saddened to hear of the treatment and financial loss Rav suffered from not being
able to publish deeply researched pieces questioning vaccine policy, I was shocked at the near
identicalness (if that’s a word) and absurdity of the wording of the rejections from numerous editors
he included in his post. Although servility to Pharma paymasters might partly explain their
rejections, I instead felt they revealed that a “collective psychosis” had taken hold       - these editors
exhibited a sudden unquestioning, pervasive (and sincere!) belief in the infallibility of the health
agencies and the trustworthiness of their data supporting a number of blatantly illogical health and
vaccine policies.

It is for this reason that Biden’s Department of Homeland Security recently created a
“Disinformation Governance Board,” the European Commission crafted a new Digital Services Act
and Code of Practice on Disinformation, and the UN is proposing a “Code of Conduct for
Information Integrity on Digital Platforms.”

All of these initiatives are allegedly the product of good intentions; all of them, however, are rooted
in the same fallacy: there is little evidence to suggest that hate speech and misinformation are on the
rise. On the contrary, Western countries are more tolerant of racial, religious, and sexual minorities
than ever before. To take one example, the percentage of Americans who approve of marriages
between white and black Americans has risen from 4% in 1958 to 87% in 2013 to 94% in 2021.

It seems Bryant’s smear may have at last achieved his goal of levying financial repercussions. In an
unsettling six-minute video posted to Twitter last week, Farage broke his silence on what he claims
has been a months-long campaign on the part of the British banking system to make him a financial
“unperson.” Without explanation, his longtime banking partner abruptly informed him they would
close all his accounts, and no other bank seems willing to accept his business. This is from a follow­
up column Farage published in The Telegraph shortly after he posted his Tweet:

“In my case, I was told by the banking group with whom I’ve been a customer since 1980      - and
with which all of my business and personal accounts have been held      - that a letter would follow the
call I received. It would offer a full explanation. The letter arrived, but it merely re-stated the
impending closure and supplied the date by which I should remove my money.

I kept this to myself while I sought a different bank. After many hours of trying, this has come to
nothing. I’ve been rejected by seven other banks. Apparently, I am a ‘politically exposed person’
and carry too much risk and too many compliance costs.

I smell a rat and am certain something much bigger is going on. For years, I have been falsely
accused of having financial links to Russian funding. Even though this is nonsense, MPs have used
parliamentary privilege to accuse various people associated with the Brexit campaign of the same
thing. Last year, the Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant claimed in the Commons chamber that I received
£548,573 in one calendar year ‘from the Russian state.’ Despite my pleas to him and the Speaker to
correct this assertion, there has been no retraction.”

Three members of Farage’s family have also seen their accounts targeted for closure, along with at
least two other members of the Brexit Party—both of whom are former Members of the European
Parliament (MEP).

Left with few options, Farage decided to use his formidable social media platform to fight back, and
his public stand may pay off. The Financial Times reported yesterday that the UK government is
investigating the blacklisting—which is great for Farage & Co., but hardly comfort for similarly
maligned individuals without Farage’s megaphone. (Conversely, Farage tweeted yesterday that he
faced his ninth bank rejection, so the hit order is still apparently active.)

Public applauded last month when Stanford investigators exposed the widespread sharing of child
pom on Instagram. Had the same Stanford researchers focused more on censoring child porn than
on censoring disfavored political views, we would all be better off.

police and military the right to read your private, encrypted text messages. And Public’s readers
will recall our scoop that eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar, and his grantees, are also demanding the
right to read your texts.

It all might seem like a trivial issue having nothing to do with the broader crackdown on free speech
globally.

But the demand by militaries and intelligence agencies around the world to read our private
messages is one of Public’s most alarming discoveries of the last six months.

The judge himself wrote in the decision, “If the allegations made by Plaintiffs are true, **the** **present**
**case** **arguably** **involves** **the** **most** **massive** **attack** **against** **free** **speech** **in** **United** **States’** **history.”**

Said Kheriaty. “And it turns out that censorship was happening not just at the behest of public
health agencies, like the CDC and the NIH, but the intelligence agencies were involved—the
Department of Justice, FBI, the State Department, Department of Homeland Security. So the whole
military intelligence industrial complex is tangled up in the censorship industrial complex.”

In his recent article in Tablet, Kheriaty called the government’s program the “Censorship
Leviathan.” Describing this leviathan as part of a totalitarian system, Kheriaty pointed to the work
### of German-American political philosopher Eric Voegelin. “[Voegelin] said the common feature of
all totalitarian systems... is the prohibition of questions,” Kheriaty explained.

With this ruling in the Missouri v. Biden censorship case, Doughty went out of his way on the
Fourth of July, to issue a stern rebuke at a conga line of government officials, many of them
characters in the Twitter Files. Racket readers will recognize names like Elvis Chan and Laura
Dehmlow (of the FBI), Jen Easterly and Brian Scully (of the Department of Homeland Security),
Laura Rosenberger (Special Assistant to the President, and one of the creators of Hamilton 68) and
Daniel Kimmage (of the Global Engagement Center), who were all just ordered to get the hell off
the First Amendment’s lawn. Paraphrasing, Doughty enjoined them from:

meeting with social-media companies for the purpose of pressuring or inducing in any
manner the removal or suppression of protected free speech;

             - flagging posts on social-media platforms and/or forwarding to social-media companies
urging the same;

             - collaborating with the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project, the Stanford
Internet Observatory, or any “like project” or group for the same purpose;


-----

             - threatening or coercing social-media companies to remove protected free speech.

The legacy media, which has been studiously ignoring this case, could not ignore yesterday’s ruling,
so there were reports in the _New_ _York_ _Times,_ the _Washington_ _Post,_ the _Wall_ _Street_ _Journal,_ _Reuters,_
and so forth. The _Times_ and the _Post_ disappointingly tried to frame the case as a partisan issue. But
### of course, it’s not a left/right or liberal/conservative issue at all: it’s a legal/illegal issue. The only
question is whether government officials did or did not violate the highest law of the land—namely,
the United States Constitution. Yesterday, the court indicated that the answer to this question is
likely yes, the government’s actions were probably unconstitutional and the plaintiff’s are likely to
succeed on the merits.

The _New_ _York_ _Times_ reporters even wrung their hands worrying that the ruling could “curtail efforts
to fight disinformation”—begging the question about who decides what constitutes disinformation.
The First Amendment clearly indicates this cannot be the job of the government. More tellingly,
the _Times_ and the _Post_ in their framing of the case simply said the quiet part out loud, indicating
that these newspapers believe government censorship is good as long as it’s controlling the flow of
information in directions that they approve.

For now, I’ll leave you with a few sobering lines from the closing pages of yesterday’s decision (p.
154):

Although this case is still relatively young, and at this stage the Court is only examining
it in terms of Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, **the** **evidence** **produced**
**thus** **far** **depicts** **an** **almost** **dystopian** **scenario.** **During** **the** **COVID-19** **pandemic,** **a**
**period** **perhaps** **best** **characterized** **by** **widespread** **doubt** **and** **uncertainty,** **the**
**United** **States** **Government** **seems** **to** **have** **assumed** **a** **role** **similar** **to** **an** **Orwellian**
**“Ministry** **of** **Truth.”**

The Plaintiffs have presented substantial evidence in support of their claims that they
were the victims of a far-reaching and widespread censorship campaign. This court
finds that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment free speech
claim against the Defendants.

Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook/Meta’s new competitor to Twitter, “Threads,” promised
users a better experience than Twitter.
“I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it,” said Zuckerberg.
“Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn’t nailed it. Hopefully we will.”

But within a few hours of launching, Threads was already secretly censoring users and not offering
them the right to appeal.

“@Meta/IG just released their new threads platform,” said conservative commentator Derek Utley
at Twitter, “and I’ve been informed by multiple users that I’m censored on their new platform.
Sheesh, can’t a dude catch a break.”

Another conservative, Rogan O’Hanley, said, “First 5 minutes on Threads and already censored.
What a platform.”

Threads flashed a warning after users clicked on Utley and O’Hanley’s profiles. “Are you sure you
want to follow...?” asked the Threads warning. “This account has repeatedly posted false
information.”
### It’s true that Meta has a legal right to censor users, that Twitter censors too, and we are less than 24
hours into the launch of Threads.

But citizens give Meta broad (Section 230) liability protection that other media companies don’t get.
It is thus reasonable to expect that, in return, Meta and other social media platforms should be
transparent about their censorship decisions and offer users the right to reply.

The day after the federal court in Missouri v. Biden granted our request for a preliminary injunction
against the government’s censorship regime, law professors Leah Litman and Laurence Tribe
published an article in Slate slamming the court’s ruling. Framing the case in entirely partisan terms,
Litman and Tribe’s analysis betrayed an inadequate understanding of the First Amendment free
speech guarantees and established limits on government power.

The next day, the Biden administration requested a stay against the injunction (which was denied by
the district court judge but granted by the Sth Circuit) nd appealed injunction ruling to the Fifth
Circuit.

Fake news about the riots in France was yet more proof that misinformation is widespread on social
media platforms, said experts last month. “This video of several cars falling from a multi-story car
park,” tweeted Shayan Sardarizadeh, a fact-checker with BBC Verify, “is from the set of the action
film Fast & Furious 8 and unrelated to the current French riots.”

Still, experts and journalists with the New York Times, AP, and BBC warn that fake news travels
six times faster than factual news. “The system that connects us,” said former CNN journalist and
Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa at a recent summit on disinformation, “spreads lies faster than facts —
six times faster.”

But the idea that fake news travels six times faster than factual news is itself fake news. The source
### of the claim, which journalists frequently repeat and never fact-check, is an MIT study of a tiny
number of _tweets,_ not news articles.

And the roughly 126,000 tweets that MIT researchers analyzed to inform the study’s findings are
equivalent to the number of tweets published in a mere 21 seconds today. In other words, they
generalized from 21 seconds of tweets to the whole of the Internet to make their sweeping claim.

More dangerously, fact-checkers spread disinformation and demand censorship based on that
disinformation. During the pandemic, Facebook alone removed 20 million posts and labeled more
than 190 million claims related to Covid-19, relying on International Fact-Checking Network
(IFCN) approved organizations to accomplish this massive “content moderation.”

There are many cases of fact-checkers spreading disinformation that then results in censorship.
Facebook censored stories claiming Covid-19 might have come from a lab. Last week,
Public documented the role played by Anthony Fauci in creating junk science to create a fake
debunking of the lab leak, which the White House and others used to justify censorship.

Fact-checkers have thus been forced to make an embarrassing series of retractions. _PolitiFact,_ the
dean of all fact-checking organizations, was forced in 2021 to retract its false debunking of a doctor
who said COVID-19 was a “man-made virus created in the lab.” And just last week, the BBC
was forced to retract its false claim that UK politician Nigel Farage was _not_ de-banked for political
reasons because, as it turned out, he was.

French President Emanuel Macron may have similarly spread disinformation after some reported


-----

that he had called for shutting down the internet in response to rioting. At first, Snopes and other
fact-checkers claimed the allegation was false. But then, just a few days later, the Guardian reported
that Macron had indeed announced that “when things get out of hand, we may have to regulate them
or cut [social networks] off.”

Despite the terrible track record of fact-checkers getting the facts wrong, spreading misinformation,
and demanding censorship, the fact-checking industry has shown no remorse, humility, or self­
awareness.

Around the world, fact-checkers engage in biased fact-checking and demand censorship of others
while displaying no apparent concern that they themselves may be guilty of the exact thing for
which they are criticizing others.

Why is that? Can anything be done to make fact-checking more... factual? Or is fact-checking
doomed to be biased, hypocritical, and authoritarian?

From an early date, commentators have noted that the response to COVID had all the look and feel
### of a coup attempt. The masks, the slogans, the symbols, the lies, the sudden inversion of long-
cherished norms and values, the mindless acceptance of information from nefarious sources like the
World Health Organization and China. Something was seriously off, and it all seemed so obvious.

Thus, one overarching question always lingered over the response to COVID. How were officials
able to implement such destructive, totalitarian policies across the western world without
intelligence authorities stepping in to stop them?

A detached review of the evidence leads to a chilling answer—though in hindsight, perhaps the only
one that was ever really possible. Quite simply, the reason the western intelligence community
never stepped in to stop this illiberalism is that **virtually** **all** **the** **most** **illiberal** **aspects** **of** **the**

[<https://public.substack.eom/p/pressure-on-facebook-and-white-house](https://public.substack.eom/p/pressure-on-facebook-and-white-house)      -

Yesterday Public reported for the first time that Facebook censored content at the request of the
White House in order to guarantee White House support in a $ 1.2 billion battle with the European
Union over data privacy.

It is a significant discovery because it points to a major and additional point of financial leverage
that the US government used to coerce censorship, in addition to widely discussed Section 230
liability protections, which President Biden, directly and indirectly, threatened — if Facebook
refused its demands to censor.

But it all raises a question: why was the Biden White House so determined to censor Facebook in
the first place?

Until the Facebook Files, the answer had been that they wanted people to take the vaccine. The
White House believed all the anti-vaccine information on Facebook was contributing to “vaccine
hesitancy.”

But now, the Facebook Files reveal that Facebook executives _knew_ censoring disfavored vaccine
views would backfire and explained to White House officials that censoring such views would
violate established norms around freedom of speech. But the White House demanded more
censorship, anyway.

In internal emails, Rosa Birch, Facebook’s Director of Strategic Response, argued that vaccine
censorship would “1/ prevent hesitant people from talking through their concerns online and
2/reinforce the notion that there’s a cover-up.’’Birch stressed that a large and strong body of
research showed the importance of “open dialogue,” access to information, and creating “an open
and safe space for people to have vaccine-related conversations.”

_Biden_ Censorship Lawsuit Likely Headed To Supreme Court ALEX GUTENTAG, LEIGHTON
WOODHOUSE, AND MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER.

[<https://public.substack.eom/p/free-speech-to-the-supreme-court>](https://public.substack.eom/p/free-speech-to-the-supreme-court)

Yesterday the Fifth Circuit court heard oral arguments in the Missouri v. Biden case, and the judges
did not hold back. One judge suggested the government “strongarms” social media companies and
that their meetings had included “veiled and not-so-veiled threats.”

Another judge described the exchange between the Biden administration and tech companies as the
government saying, “Jump!” and the companies responding, “How high?”

“That’s a really nice social media company you got there. It’d be a shame if something happened to
it,” the judge said, describing the government’s coercive tactics.

Attorney John Sauer, representing Louisiana, masterfully argued that the government had
repeatedly violated the First Amendment. He pointed to specific evidence of coercion in the
Facebook Files.

“You have a really interesting snapshot into what Facebook C-suite is saying,” Sauer explained.
“They're emailing Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and saying things like... ‘Why were we
taking out speech about the origins of covid and the lab leak theory?”’ The response, Sauer said,
was, “Well, we shouldn’t have done it, but we're under pressure from the administration.”

He also cited an email from Nick Clegg, Facebook President of Global Affairs, that pointed to
“bigger fish to fry with the Administration      - data flows, etc.” On Monday, Public reported that these
“data flows” referred to leverage the Biden administration had over the company; **Facebook**
**needed** **the** **White** **House** **to** **negotiate** **a** **deal** **with** **the** **European** **Union.** Only through this deal


-----

could Facebook maintain access to user data that is crucial for its **$1.2** **billion** **annual** **European**
**business.**

Fenny also stated that social media companies had not removed any true content. From the case’s
discovery as well as the Facebook Files we know that is far from true. Facebook, against internal
research and advice, _did_ remove “often-true content” that might discourage people from getting
vaccinated. Facebook’s own emails clearly suggest that the company only did this due to pressure
from figures within the Biden Administration.
Based on this hearing, the plaintiffs in Missouri v. Biden may have a strong chance of winning.
Biden’s DOJ simply had no valid arguments to present. The evidence is clear: the administration
brazenly engaged in an unlawful censorship campaign and instrumentalized private companies to do
its bidding. This total disregard for fundamental civil liberties will be a stain on the Democratic
Party for years to come.

The Supreme Court will be the supreme victory in the US, but our free speech work won’t be done
after we win there. No nation enjoys free speech protections like ours. And so, after we win in the
US, you can expect to see us helping our allies abroad achieve similar protections from government
strongarming, aka censorship, in their own nations.

Read our 18 July media release <https://citizensparty.org.au/media-releases/denounce-albaneses-
orwellian-social-media-censorship-law> to learn what you need to know about the Albanese
government’s Orwellian social media censorship bill.

Essentially, the government is trying to justify suppressing free speech on social media on the
pretext of stopping “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is “harmful”; however, each of
those terms are open to broad interpretation, which makes this bill potentially far more dangerous
than any perceived problem it seeks to address.

There’s a reason the American founding fathers enshrined freedom of speech in the US Constitution.
### It’s the same reason that Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia
in 1948 helped to draft, states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” When governments contrive
pretexts to limit speech, they are lurching down the dangerous path to totalitarianism.

Click on the link below to go to the government’s consultation page, where you can either upload or
email a submission objecting to the bill.

Note: a “submission” does not need to be a lawyer’s analysis; it’s simply a letter from you, as brief

A new Senate bill would establish a new federal agency in charge of social media. The bill was put
forward by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. It
would establish a Digital Consumer Protection Commission to police, censor and deplatform social
media as the government sees fit. Already I don’t like it. After a judge told the government to stop
censoring social media, they now want a government agency that can do it for them.

Today’s essay is not one that I have looked forward to writing, but apparently it has to be done.
Like extracting a rotting tooth, painful but necessary.

As some of you may know, I write about fifth generation warfare from the point of view of
someone who has been constantly subjected to it for about three years. Day in and day out. Five, ten
times a day. Coordinated waves of attacks, some clearly coming from corporate media cooperating
with the US Government and Pharma, others from the fevered imaginations of a wide variety of
individual actors with a wide variety of motivations, and some coming from coordinated
cyberstalker teams of bots and trolls       - which the Epoch Times has documented are at least
partially paid for and facilitated by the Foundation for the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention.

I will try to approach this as a case study in how the ecosystem of hate interacts with and is
exploited by those engaging in Fifth Generation Warfare against US Citizens. But as I have been
the particular target of this latest round of hate and defamation, which is at least partially designed
to delegitimize me (and partially an attack on the RFKjr presidential campaign), please forgive me
### if I stray from just sticking to the facts.

First, an introduction to many of the key players in this little drama.

Anticipating the usual criticism, yes, one strategy to deal with all of this would be to ignore it. Just
like I have been repeatedly advised to ignore the defamatory attacks from the following over the last

whose public elevation of the concerns of many Americans aims to revitalise national politics, are

Like all institutions, politics falls apart without regular infusions of constructive energy. A modern
democracy is healthy only if its major parties grow organically from their voters, representing their
interests by habit and inclination even more than conscious effort. Our governing elites represent no
one but themselves and their cronies, and they don’t welcome shocks to the system. Insurgent
candidates such as Robert Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy, whose public elevation of the
concerns of many Americans aims to revitalise national politics, are censored and met with active
resistance, even by their own parties.

Targeted advertising, fine-tuned algorithms, and politically stratified social media sharply decrease
our exposure to new ideas. We are immuring ourselves within our own private caves, watching
flickering images in darkness.

This is our fight. This is a battle of good against evil. Our individual and national sovereignty
combined with Judeo-Christian values against a dark force that has no values, no center, no
compelling moral compass. Just darkness, an abyss of narcissistic self entertainment and
gratification.

What is the root cause of this nihilism? This unholy darkness? How do we fight it? Are people
tearing down the very fabric of our nation, just to be able tofeel something? A lazy person’s way to
feel passion?

_The_ _passion_ _to_ _build_ _up_ _versus_ _the_ _passion_ _to_ _tear_ _down_ is a critical component in all of this. We
must build for good, for the future. We must fight not just to resist the encroachment of evil, but
activelyfor the cause _good._

     - On approx 10'8'23. 'The Scott Ritter show' YT channel and 'Ask the Inspector' channel were taken
down in the past week. A search 14'8'23 on YT does not turn up his channel, so his historic work
for peace, understanding Russia's point of view on Ukraine, caling out the US's withdrawal from
nuclear weapons arms limitation treaty (Ritter helped put in place), etc is all removed.
Youtube take down was based on 'hate speech', which Ritter denies for all his videos.. YT did not
tender an example of of his transgression, and gave no prior warning. This potentialy makes a
content creator self-censoring, which is perhaps more severe than downright censorship. This seems
to me to parallel the Chinese model for internet control, which allows only good news, and censors
content that might reflect badly on governance; resulting in not being alerted to violence locally,
festering social problems, corruption, etc. With Beijing flooding in past few days, Chinese social
media in some flood areas was turned off, denying people in 2m flood waters and cold/wet/hungry
an avenue to cry for help. This so authorities can 'save face'.

We need to be able to hear all voices, and then let the truth prevail. The answer to bad information
is good information.

**Medical** **Freedom** **Summit.** **AUGUST** **19,** **2023** **|** **SALEM,** **NH.** **View** **the** **event** **schedule** **here**

The tyrannical threat of the biomedical security state is ever present.

While those that cheered for lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and the shutdown of the global
economy retreat to the back pages of the news, the World Health Organization and their ilk are
already gearing up for the next crisis. The covid scare may have lost its political potency, but you
can be sure that "public health emergencies" will continue to be a powerful tool for future control.

Join us for a Medical Freedom Summit featuring two brave leaders in the fight against medical
tyranny.

Dr. Peter McCul lough is one of the most respected truth tellers in the profession, making him a
frequent target of censorship from regime-controlled traditional and social media. One of America's
most published cardiologists, Dr. McCullough has authored dozens of peer-reviewed publications
on covid and the policy response it sparked.

Dr. Aaron Kheriaty is a fellow and director of the Bioethics and American Democracy program for
the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Fired from his position as a professor of psychiatry and human
behavior at the University of California, Irvine, Dr. Kheriaty is not only a leading intellectual figure
in medical freedom but a man who has lived his principles at great personal cost.

1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the

This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be

5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death

7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the

9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the

10. During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate
### the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.

The right to avoid the imposition of human experimentation is fundamentally rooted in the
Nuremberg Code of 1947. has been ratified by the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and further codified
in the US. Code of Federal Regulations. In addition to the US regarding itself as bound by these
provisions, these principles were adopted by the FDA in its regulations requiring the informed
consent of human subjects for medical research. It is unlawful to conduct medical research even in
the case of an emergency unless steps are taken to secure informed consent of all participants.

Article 6, section 3: In no case should a collective community agreement or the consent of a
community leader or other authority substitute for an individual’s informed consent. Clearly,
mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations fail this test on multiple fronts.

 d) > 15'10'21 article. Is there evidence that natural exposure immunity to COVID virus is similar or superior to vaccine-induced immunity, and should we force/mandate these vaccines on our healthy military and police? Paul Alexander.

I argue for the superiority of natural immunity over the narrow ‘spike-specific’ immature immunity
conferred by the COVID injections. Yet you can assess the available body of evidence yourself and
make a judgement. The refusal by NIAID’s Anthony Fauci, CDC’s Rochelle Walensky, and NIH’s
Francis Collins to recognize natural immunity as similar to or even superior to vaccine immunity is

outrageous, unscientific, and downright absurd. We said before that our children must be considered
already immune and vaccinated (based on biological and molecular evidence) and leave them alone
with these sub-optimal, non-sterilizing, unneeded injections, and now we say the very same for our
militaries and police. Leave them to hell alone with vaccine mandates for they can make personal
informed decisions while at the same time being at vanishingly low risk for severe outcome from
COVID! We can potentially cause needless harm and death to our military and police with these
safety untested injections. Allow our best people (in fact everyone) to balance the benefits and
harms (risks) especially if they are already COVID recovered and have gained rich, robust,
sterilizing, life-long natural immunity. One and done! Allow proper informed consent (for the first
time). Follow the Nuremberg Code of Ethics etc. Below is the existing body of evidence on natural
immunity versus vaccine immunity as it relates to COVID-19 (Table 1). This represents the most
updated and comprehensive library list of over 70 of the highest-quality, complete, most robust
scientific studies and evidence reports/position statements on natural immunity as compared to the
COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity and allow you to draw your own conclusion:

### Study 1 (of 70 listed) “Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined among 52,238 employees in an American healthcare system. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination...”

The End
