# Submission concerning the exposure draft of the Communications
 Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I am very firmly opposed to this draft legislation.

The whole concept of what it is trying to achieve is wrong. It is undemocratic, illiberal,
controlling and ultimately, dangerous.

The first sentence in the website (New ACMA powers to combat misinformafion and
disinformafion | Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communicafions
and the Arts) canvassing our feedback, after the headline ‘The Issue’ says:

‘Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to
our democracy, society and economy.’


No it doesn’t. Just the opposite. And this is why:


(1) Who is anyone to say what is misinformation and disinformation. A

government body. No thanks. Only the cut and thrust of free public debate can
hope to get all the arguments out there and a consensus reached. One only
needs to look at the failure of many covid era government policies to see how
destructive and in error it is to allow only one point of view. Furthermore, it is
not the role of government to monitor our speech and certainly not to control
it. You may as well rename ACMA the Ministry of Truth.

(2) I’m not sure how misinformation or disinformation can be a threat to safety

and wellbeing. We should not be catering to the lowest common denominator
in such issues. I recall a common refrain that ‘sticks and stones may break my
bones, but names will never hurt me’. The answer for those offended by
words is either harden up or respond with their arguments.

(3) We already have Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 which

covers cases of racial or ethnic abuse.

(4) I don’t want a nanny state shielding me from discussion. No progress in any

society has ever been made by shutting down new ideas or the discussion of
the merits of the status quo. Scientific advancement, for example, is achieved
by specifically questioning the current theories.

(5) The government should recognise that tolerance and diversity should apply

equally to people’s opinions. Not just immutable traits.

(6) Free speech is the font from which all our other freedoms derive. Erode free


speech and every other right can potentially be removed. Seriously.

(7) In recognition of the above arguments a district court in Louisiana has just

called the US Federal Government’s pressure on social media companies to
curtail posts about Covid 19, the most massive attack against free speech in
Unites States history. Do we want to repeat those errors here?


You may publish this feedback apart from contact details below.


I do not represent any organisation.
