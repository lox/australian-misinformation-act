The Australian Federal Government seeks to introduce draconian and dystopian new legislation to
stifle free speech, allegedly in the name of combating "misinformation" and "disinformation".

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 purports "to hold digital platform services to account and create transparency around their
_efforts in responding to misinformation and disinformation in Australia."_

That's the official line. The reality is that this bill is designed to give the government totalitarian powers
to crush freedom of speech.

The draft bill states "digital platform provider means a person who provides a digital platform
_service," which casts a very wide net._

The "harm" this bill purports to prevent includes any of the following:

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender,
sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability;
(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;
(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or
local government institutions;
(d) harm to the health of Australians;
(e) harm to the Australian environment;
(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian
economy

In regards to (a), we already have federal anti-discrimination and hate speech laws purporting to
prevent offense to minority groups. Namely, the Age Discrimination Act 2004, Australian Human
_Rights Commission Act 1986, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Racial Discrimination Act 1975, and_
the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.

Based on the self-serving behaviour of both Commonwealth and State governments to date, the true
meaning of (b) and (c) can be fairly construed as anything that threatens the government and its
agendas. When governments act against their people, then it is the democratic right of citizens to object
and protest. This new bill endows government with the power to squash dissent, no matter how calm,
reasoned and non-violent.

As for (d), (e) and (f), Federal and State governments routinely cause health, economic, financial and
environmental harm to Australia and its citizens via their predatory behaviour, their wasteful spending
and their preferential treatment of multinational corporations (many of whom pay zero corporate tax,
while Australians struggle with an endless array of taxes, fees, fines, levies, rates and worsening cost of
living pressures).

Governments, along with their mainstream media allies, are also by far the biggest disseminators of
misinformation and disinformation in the country.

Which, of course, is why the government has conveniently exempted itself from having to abide by the
new laws. "[T]he Commonwealth", "a State", "a Territory" are all exempted from having to abide by
the censorship laws they intend to impose on the public they are supposed to serve.

Other content exempted by the draconian new bill includes that emanating from "a foreign government
_or a body recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor of educational institutions."_

So under this new law, powerful foreign entities that already hold sway over Australia, such as the US
and China, will qualify for free speech privileges denied to ordinary Australians.

This all raises the question of just what qualifies government as the ultimate arbiter of truth.

What is government, exactly?

In Australia, government includes people who masturbate on each other's desks, and are so proud of
doing so that they film and share their handiwork - only to later complain they are the victim of
'revenge porn' (see: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-29/police-report-made-over-deskmasturbation-scandal/100105650).

Government in Australia includes people who use the Parliament House chapel to engage in sex acts
with their similarly depraved colleagues and prostitutes (see: https://7news.com.au/politics/federalpolitics/graphic-images-of-sex-acts-inside-parliament-house-leaked-c-2407876).

Australian Government features people like Scott Morrison, who “allowed cabinet to be misled” on the
legality of the Centrelink Robodebt scheme. In other words, he was well aware the scheme, which
triggered over 2,000 suicides, was illegal (see: https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/politics/australianpolitics/2023/08/08/push-refer-ex-pm-morrison-robodebt/ and
https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelinkrobodebt-notice/10821272).

The current pinnacle of Australian Government is one Anthony Albanese, whose ruling party is behind
this draconian new anti-free speech bill. When asked by 3AW host Neil Mitchell recently what he
would do if he held dictator-like powers (something Albanese is clearly working on with this bill), the
PM's answer was highly revealing. Albanese replied he would use his new iron fist - not to stamp out
corruption nor to increase the notoriously lenient sentences given to sex offenders here in Australia but to ban social media. Albanese, the man with unlimited propaganda funds at his disposal and who
hides behind a team of staffers and security personnel, said he hated "keyboard warriors" because they
wrote things he claims they would never say to his face (see: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article12411539/Anthony-Albanese-dictator-ban-social-media-abolish-states.html).

If Albanese were honest, he would admit it is because they write things he cannot refute without getting
angry and resorting to petulant name-calling. Witness his recent dismissal of "Voice" skeptics - which,
according to polling, is a majority of Australians - as "Qanon" conspiracy theorists (see:
https://youtu.be/yA-4hmQsJYM).

Other Albanese claims to fame include being spotted entering and photographed leaving a Dulwich Hill
massage parlor in 2013 - an establishment well known to offer "rub'n'tugs" "happy endings", "body
_slides" and other illegal sexual services. According to those with inside knowledge, the incident was_
hushed up because the media was too scared to antagonize the Labour government while it was in the
midst of media reform legislation (see: https://anthonycolpo.substack.com/p/australian-pm-anthonyalbanese-photographed).

Is it not a huge conflict of interest for a man who would no doubt prefer this incident to remain buried

to be introducing legislation that allows him and his party to determine what qualifies as
_"misinformation" and "disinformation"?_

As stated earlier, the government itself is a massive source of egregious "misinformation" and
_"disinformation". Throughout the COVID 'pandemic', for example, both Federal and State governments_
lied through their teeth.

We were repeatedly told we were in the midst of a deadly pandemic, which was complete nonsense.
Mortality was in fact lower than average during 2020, prior to the introduction of the gene therapies the
government misleadingly described as 'vaccines'. The average age of a so-called 'COVID' death
throughout the 'pandemic' was 86 - two years higher than the national average! (See:
https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-at-a-glance-13-may-2021).

Well before the gene therapy rollout commenced, renowned Stanford researcher John P A Ioannidis
had already analyzed data from around the globe and reported an infection fatality rate of only 0.27%.
In people younger than 70 years, the median infection fatality rate was 0.05% (see:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7947934/)

Despite the near 100% survival rate, our Federal and State governments vigorously pushed the lie that
COVID was a deadly threat and that we needed to take 'vaccines' to protect ourselves and others. So
much so, that they imposed draconian mandates that forced people to either get injected or lose their
job (which for some people would literally have meant losing their home).

To justify this cruel medical tyranny, Federal and State governments incessantly told us the 'vaccines'
were "safe", "effective" and "thoroughly tested". They were blatantly lying on all counts.

An impartial examination of the clinical trial data showed the vaccines were not effective, and that the
_"95% effective" figure widely cited for the Pfizer drug was a misleading relative risk figure that_
diminished to a pathetic 0.84% when considered in absolute terms (see:
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext#%20)

And far from being the lifesavers they were widely promoted as by government, the Pfizer clinical trial
in fact showed a higher death rate in the 'vaccine' group (see page 23 of:
https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download).

Little surprise then, that after the low mortality of 2020, the rollout of the gene therapies was
accompanied by a striking increase in mortality.

In 2022 in Australia, there were 25,235 (15.3%) more deaths than the historical average (see:
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/jan-dec-2022).

In 2023, up to 30 April, there were 6,220 deaths (12.3%) more than the baseline average (see:
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/latest-release).

Natural variations in annual mortality are in the order of 1-2%; a massive annual jump of 12-15% is
seismic. According to the Actuaries Institute, it's something Australia has not seen since World War II
(see: https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/almost-20-000-more-people-died-in-australia-last-yearthan-anticipated-20230303-p5cp64.html).


-----

While newspapers and our politicians/bureaucrats bombarded us with daily 'case' counts during the low
mortality of 2020, they have shown a staggering lack of interest in exploring the cause of this
frightening increase of mortality that occurred after the 'vaccine' rollout (see:
https://www.reignitedemocracyaustralia.com.au/opposed/).

The government clearly lied to us about the COVID gene therapies, and it lied to us about other useless
interventions like masks. In fact, it is still doing so. The Commonwealth government, in a textbook
classic display of misinformation, claims "Wearing a face mask can help protect you and those around
_you. Face masks stop viruses from spreading through the air. This means you are less likely to catch or_
_spread the virus" (see: https://www.health.gov.au/topics/covid-19/protect-yourself-and-others)._

Face masks have never been shown under anything resembling controlled conditions to prevent
respiratory infections, as a recent review by the esteemed Cochrane database reported (see:
https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full).

Nothing I have stated above is "misinformation", "disinformation" or the rantings of "conspiracy
_theorists" - almost all the COVID-related hyperlinks I have included link either to peer-reviewed_
studies, the Commonwealth government's own statistics or US FDA documentation. Yet as Federal and
State government behaviour during the 'pandemic' showed, this is exactly the type of factual
information governments, and the social media companies they alternately shower with threats and
money, seek to suppress. The new anti-free speech legislation will grant the federal government more
power than ever to do so.

In summary, government is comprised of dishonest, degenerate characters with scant regard for the
facts. Needless to say, these are people who have absolutely no place claiming to be the arbiter of what
is true and false.

The way to attack bad information is with good information, with unassailable facts and superior logic.
Resorting to censorship is a dead giveaway that the government does not possess either of the latter
attributes. It must instead silence its opponents and critics by weaponizing the law against them.

If the government was truly serious about protecting the public from harm arising from bad
information, it would immediately act against the ongoing sexualization of young children. Instead, we
see the government stand idly by while major outlets like Big W have marketed books featuring
explicit descriptions of sexual acts to young kids.

In short, this is a self-serving bill clearly designed to suppress dissent and criticism of the government,
disingenuously marketed as a war against harmful information in the name of the public good.
