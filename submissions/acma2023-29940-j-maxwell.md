# The proposed new bill says that:


# "Misinformation and disinformation is a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy"

 However, I see no evidence in support of this and I am therefore very much against the proposed new bill. I support free speech and oppose
## this legislation.
