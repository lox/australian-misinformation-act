Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you with great disappointment and outrage regarding the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I
firmly believe in the importance of freedom of speech and I am deeply troubled by the implications
of this bill for our democratic society.

This legislation clearly disregards the freedom of speech of Australian citizens. By creating two
classes of citizens, with certain privileged groups having the power to spread information deemed
false or misleading, while others are subject to excessive fines and restrictions, the government is
effectively silencing the voices of regular people who have valuable insights and knowledge.

The internet has been a transformative force in promoting democracy and giving a voice to ordinary
individuals. However, this bill puts that democratic power at risk, disproportionately harming regular
citizens who rely on this platform to express themselves and contribute to public discourse.

Furthermore, the task of accurately judging what is true or untrue is impossible. Information and
scientific understanding are constantly evolving, and what was once accepted as fact can later be
proven false. Examples of widely accepted information surrounding COVID-19 that was later
debunked demonstrate the challenges of determining truth in real-time.

Under this legislation, not only false information but also information that is deemed misleading or
deceptive can be restricted. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that allows for open and
honest discussions, where individuals can be wrong and the truth can be debated to reach common
ground.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious
concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His Twitter post on June 25th, 2023,
highlighted the difficulty of implementing legislation to combat misinformation while acknowledging
the risk of penalizing information that may turn out to be accurate.

Industry bodies, often influenced by the largest players in the industry, are likely to create onerous
codes that smaller digital services cannot comply with, effectively gatekeeping the industry. This
undermines the principles of free-market competition, which has shown to be effective in
addressing misinformation by allowing users to migrate to platforms that meet their expectations.

Furthermore, this bill does not account for competition regulators' efforts to lower barriers for entry
into the digital platform industry. The proposed code overlooks the wipeout of small platforms and
websites that cannot comply with these codes, favouring the largest digital services and impeding
competition.

The far-reaching nature of this bill is concerning, encompassing thousands of community websites
and potentially subjecting website owners to exorbitant fines. The lack of awareness of industry
codes among website owners, especially those located overseas, raises questions about the
practicality and fairness of implementation.

In addition, the delegation of legislative power to private entities, who are not directly accountable
to Parliament, raises constitutional concerns. This arrangement infringes upon the freedom of
political communication and negatively impacts public debate on matters of public interest, which
are often highly contested. By categorizing certain viewpoints as misinformation and disinformation,
while giving preferential treatment to government and accredited media and educational
institutions, this bill undermines diversity in viewpoints and undermines the democratic process.
Australians will be discouraged from engaging in public conversations when their viewpoints may be
arbitrarily silenced or labelled as misinformation.

The threats posed to digital platform providers and ordinary users under this bill further reinforce
the disempowerment of individuals. The imposition of negative records, financial penalties, and
reputational damage on platform providers, as well as the stress and potential harm caused by
hauling ordinary people before ACMA, is reminiscent of undemocratic regimes and goes against the
values of mateship and fairness.

Furthermore, the limitations imposed by this bill hinder citizens' access to information necessary for
informed voting decisions, which is a cornerstone of our democracy. The potential targeting of
independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers will have a chilling effect on free speech
and will create an unlevel playing field that favours government-approved publications. Australia, as
a founding member of the United Nations and a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, should uphold the principles of freedom of thought, conscience, and expression. This bill fails
to recognize the diverse perspectives and experiences of ordinary citizens, suppressing their voices
in favour of government and accredited institutions.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. Its provisions not only infringe upon the freedom of
speech and enterprise but also undermine the democratic principles upon which our nation was
built. I implore the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts to reconsider this bill and uphold the values of freedom, diversity, and
democracy that are the foundation of our society.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I trust that my concerns and objections will be taken into
account during the review process.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Lindsay R. Hasluck
