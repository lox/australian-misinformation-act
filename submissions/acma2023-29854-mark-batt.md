To whom it may concern,

This proposed misinformation and disinformation bill is censorship plain and simple and is reminding me
a lot of another party in History that much like the Labor party claimed to be the national workers party,
also promoted Socialism and had radical ideas about the native peoples. I have recently spent a lot of
time with indigenous and was even invited out on country with them and shown their sacred sites. They
shared a lot of disturbing history with me as well as their opposition to current government proposals.
They have been censored by Australian Governments for a long time a lot of it recently, I thought we
were moving a diection of tolerance and understanding. This can only come from open communication.

To being my analyses of this bill I think it is important that we look at this exert from the Holocaust
Encyclopedia. https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-propaganda-and-censorship

If we do not learn from our past we are destined to repeat it. This is a tragic event in Human history that
is in grave danger of emerging once again. Although the modern left claims to be against the right wing
agendas of Nazis they seem very quick to share many of the same ideologies and policies, this new bill is
the perfect example of my disturbing observations. The web site Alpha History shows a similar bill
implemented by the NAZIS and I would like to draw attention in particular to section fourteen,

https://alphahistory.com/nazigermany/editorial-law-nazi-censorship-1933/

“Editors are especially obligated to keep out of the newspapers anything which:
# a. is misleading to the public by mixing selfish interests with community interests;”

The ambiguous term that states “anything that is misleading” is strikingly similar to the term and
definitions of Misinformation and its subjective language in the exposure draft on page 16

This terminology could mean anything the government doesn’t like or considers a threat to itself an
assessment that history agrees with.

It is indeed interesting that this comes after a disturbing period of Government overreach in Australia,
where time has clearly shown the people that provided Misinformation and Disinformation were in fact
people in Government, people in media and those that claim to be experts. It is also interesting that
Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other Countries in Europe have started this process of controlling
people’s speech online right after Joe Biden failed to take control of free speech in America where many
of the Targeted Tech companies currently do business. Biden failed for the simple reason that it was a
Violation of the first amendment right to free speech.

More troubling in this proposed misinformation and disinformation bill is the Exclusion for services that
allows The Minister to legislate a free pass for specific platforms on page 15

And of course, the approved government information is also excluded from censorship in the definitions
prescribed on page 9.

This seems to leave a nice place for the chosen few to say whatever they like without Scrutiny, while all
others are forced to self-regulate and be regulated in accordance with this bill. It is almost as if there is
an intention to run Propaganda from some pages and quell the debate against it on others.

This bill is abhorrent to free speech in Australia and as it is in conjunction with other nations around the
world it is clearly an assault on Free speech globally. No good can come from this and one is left
wondering why all of a sudden there seems to be a globally coordinated assault on the free speech of
the people in their own countries. This will only further the rapidly growing mistrust in government,
media and other institutions globally. It is my personal experience that the only people that want to stop
the flow of information are the ones with something to hide and or up to no good. Is the government
trying to tell us something?

I would like to draw your attention to another historical Socialist party, this time Russia. Around 100
years ago Socialist Russia had varying forms of Censorship and again it was not for the benefit of the
people although that is what they were told. Censorship is clearly outlined in the website
https://www.gcsehistory.com/faq/sovcensor.html as

_“Censorship is the control of information in the media which could be considered unacceptable by the_
_government. Under Stalin's rule, the Soviet government had very strict control of information in terms of_
_what people could see, hear or read.”_

The reasoning for this was clear, and is what I fear the Labor Government is also trying to do, again I refer
to https://www.gcsehistory.com/faq/sovcensor.html

_There were 3 main reasons why Stalin used censorship:_

  - _To control what people knew._

  - _To stop any criticism of him or the government._

  - _To stop any opposition developing or having the ability to undermine the government._

As an artist I find this current bill very disturbing to creation of art another form of free speech that is
targeted in the prosed bill on page 8.

As also stated in

The web site shows that this kind of law has historically led to the destruction of art.
https://www.gcsehistory.com/faq/sovcensor.html

_“Censorship had a negative impact on art and culture as the quality of what was produced was reduced._
_Some artists refused to create any work.”_

There are a great many examples of Censorship around the world historically and it is always associated
with repressive, socialist, communist, totalitarian dictatorships and I find it very disturbing indeed that in
this modern area anyone in this country would be attempting to implement such a thing. After having
spent some time recently with our indigenous and getting their views I discovered how much the


-----

Australian government has tried to suppress their free speech. Some still remember not being able to
speak their language and their oral traditions. This has already done a massive amount of damage to the
Aboriginal culture through censorship. It is baffling that our current government would propose an
indigenous voice to parliament and at the same time seek to suppress the voice of the entire country.

It is very easy site so many more examples of this kind of suppression through out history, books are
filled with suppression of information from evil governments and rulers, but I wish to keep this brief and
to the point. If the Government wishes to increase trust and faith in the people it should begin with
maintaining a free and open society. Government should listen to people and speak honestly, clearly and
with the interests of ALL of the people at heart. The truth will prevail, suppression is not the answer,
open discussion is. I hope that those that claim to represent us all, and claim to be our voice already, will
do the right thing by shutting this bill down before history repeats itself once again and another dark
chapter in evil governance begins.
