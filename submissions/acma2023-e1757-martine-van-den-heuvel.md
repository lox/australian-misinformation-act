Both”misinformation” and “disinformation” are opinions of people. As long as there is freedom of speech, there is no
misinformation and disinformation, these are just opinions of people which should be heard. The general public can
assess all these opinions and from this, choose to agree or disagree and pick their own path forward. People don’t
need a committee to tell them what opinion to choose? This bill will reduce our freedom of speech and will provide
more power to the authorities who will decide what is “true” and “not true”.
Therefore, I do not support this bill.
