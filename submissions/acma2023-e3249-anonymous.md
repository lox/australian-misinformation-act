Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

My name sEand I’m a first generation migrant. I’ve lived the first years of my life in a communist country. I know
what freedom of speech means. Freedom of any kind doesn’t guarantee that people will always make the right
choices. But taking away that freedom guarantees that people and their choices are not important anymore. They
were trumped by an ideology.

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a
non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
