Dear Tyrannical Leader,

Thank you for being so concerned about the amount of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ that
floats around the public sphere. Catch phrases I have never really heard of or used in my 58 years of
life – until the advent of Covid-19.

It is extraordinary the amount of insight that is completely lacking from those who work in
government departments who seek to ‘protect us’ from the perils of reading/spreading
‘misinformation’.

With a seemingly straight face, government departments wish to ‘Combat Mis/Dis information’ and
helpfully change legislation.

Ironically, it is the government and their puppet agencies who have been, and STILL are, continuing
to be the biggest offenders of creating and spreading mis/disinformation, which really is just a fancy
way of saying outright lies.

Who is the ACMA made up of? Are they elected? Or are they a faceless group of persons who have
their own agendas of advancement and cushy jobs lined up forever-more if they bow to the whims
of the government – yes, would be the answer to that.

What if they get too big for their boots and start thinking they are the almighty rulers of what is
dis/mis information? – Oh sorry, that already happened.

It is a FACT that the Australian government colluded with ‘big tech’ during the Covid fiasco, because
as soon as anyone posted anything about covid on any platform, a nice big tag appeared directing
the poor brain-dead reader (who cannot decipher fact from fiction without government direction) to
the ‘government information’ websites, helpfully saving us from having to use our own critical
thinking skills. I personally had a post removed from Facebook for daring post a joke of the ‘safe and
effective’ narrative. So, don’t tell me you don’t already wield this power. It was probably unlawful to
do this, so now you want to legislate it.

It is my experience and opinion (and a fact) that the government ALREADY has enough power to
regulate communications. Who are YOU/ACMA to decide what I read? If I want to subscribe to the
‘flat earthers’, I will! In a democratic society, I am able to discern what I wish to read.

Before covid, it appears that the communications regulations were sufficient. However, during the
covid propaganda campaign, the government didn’t obviously bank on the people being so clever as
to see through the complete rubbish promulgated over time from all the authorised
communications avenues. It is worth noting that just about EVERYTHING to do with the covid
response was made up on the hop by fools (how many persons can attend events, social distancing,
masking etc) So, NOW, our communications regulations are NOT sufficient, because you can’t censor
everyone……just yet….but you’re working on it.

During the covid years (that unfortunately are still lingering), I lost all and complete faith in any
Australian government. You are all in it for yourselves. You are drunk on power and think as soon as
you say the words, ‘for your safety’ we will all cower and capitulate and do everything you say. You
do your deeds in the cover of darkness. To this day, you still lie about the response to covid, how
most measures were made up and not scientific, and how you spent 18bn AUD on covid ‘vaccines’
that DID NOT STOP THE SPREAD of the virus and then raised my interest rates because of spending.

What the Australian governments at all levels have conveniently forgotten, is, you don’t rule us. You
were put there to govern us. You are not there to tell me what I can eat, what I can read, what I can

watch. You are put there to spend our tax dollars wisely. However, 18bn AUD on the covid so-called
vaccine is not a wise use of my money, has anyone been sacked for this? NO!

‘Mis/disinformation can cause and contribute to harm’. It sure can. Like; saying Ivermectin is horse
paste? Or, MRNA technology in vaccines is safe and effective? Or, covid started from a bat at a wet
market? Or, PCR testing is necessary on everyone even if you don’t have symptoms? Or, everyone
has to quarantine, even if you’re not sick? Or, lock the borders to stop the spread? Or, natural
immunity only exists for vaccinated persons, I could go on for some pages, but I think I’ve made my
point.

I fail to see how this bill, will in any way, shape or form, help Australia’s democracy, society or
economy. It’s completely fabricated nonsense. I have ready a large number of government
documents over the past 3 years, and all of them follow a formula of repeating vacuous, mindless
nonsense over, and over in the hope the reader will not notice.

The ‘fact sheet’ is a one and a half page document that uses the words mis/disinformation in almost
every sentence. Good propaganda technique. The last paragraph lets the reader know that before ‘it
is finalised’ Australians can comment so there’s ‘an appropriate balance in protecting Australians
from harm’. What ‘harm’ do you refer to? A throw away line that explains nothing, but sounds scary
to those with no brain.

The silent majority have seen through all the lies. Covid was a very successful global campaign, the
likes of which I personally have never seen. I am thankful to it in some ways, because, before covid, I
willingly DID believe the lies my government told me. No longer. This bill is obviously the next level
in really ruling our lives. Without alternative media, we have a nation, a world of blithering robots
who cannot think for themselves, and I guess that’s the whole idea.

I say A RESOUNDING NO to your proposed legislation.

Sincerely,

Amanda Rinaldi
