Dear sirs

I write to you opposing the misinformation bill that you are trying to pass in parliament.

This is an attempt from foreign interference to stop a free and democratic society from existing.

1. Why should we trust the governamental decisions on what is true and what is not true? Who is making these decisions and
why?

2. Science is about debate and doubt and opposite opinions to be real science, it is about viewing different researches,
otherwise you are just imposing the views of a certain minority who seem to have enough financial power to buy anyone with no
scruples, sadly the number of people willing to give up their personal views on any matter for monetary gain seems to be
growing in the last few decades but more so in the last 3 years.

3. If we are a free democratic society as we are supposed to be then there is no place for such measures. You may not silence
people because they have a different opinion to a government body, it is out of order and it goes against the declaration of
human rights, article 19.

4. This sort of bill will only further divide our society. How can anyone thrive in such conditions of threat and fear of what we
think and say?

5. It is utterly inappropriate, we are experiencing this world wide because of the power grab from Non elected officials, from
non elected foreign bodies such as the WHO and the WEF, which are nothing but private organisations that we, the people of
this country and of the world, have NEVER been asked about, elected of approved.

6. Censorship on freedom of speech is a serious breech of human rights and it should not be touched by contrary unelected
bodies or anyone else.

Thanking you kindly for taking the time to read this.
