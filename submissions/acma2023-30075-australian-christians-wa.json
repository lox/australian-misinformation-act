    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The bill grants excessive powers to ACMA, which could silence large portions of the population with dissenting views.",
      "Terms like 'misinformation' and 'disinformation' are subjective and could be used to suppress opposing viewpoints.",
      "The bill could infringe on freedom of speech, a fundamental human right protected by international agreements.",
      "The government should not have the power to define and censor 'misinformation', especially given past instances of censorship.",
      "Freedom of speech includes the right to be wrong, and suppressing dissenting views could hinder progress."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [
      "Freedom of Speech",

    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "Freedom of speech means nothing if there is no freedom for people to be wrong.",
      "Australians are being asked to sign a blank cheque: to surrender their freedom of speech online to unknown, unseen and undefined forces.",
