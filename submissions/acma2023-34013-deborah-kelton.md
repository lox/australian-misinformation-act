Dear Mesdames and Sir,

the proposal to amend legislation to allow the ACMA new powers “to combat” misinformation and
disinformation is problematic and very troubling. The expanded powers would have the potential to
be used for censorship, quashing freedom of speech and limiting access to any content or opinion
deemed to be not in the public interest, or “harmful”.

Who determines the definition of “misinformation” or “harmful”? The government? A bureaucratic
body such as ACMA itself?

The public has a right to decide for themselves what may or may not be “misinformation”, as they
always have, based on their life experience and weighed by their common sense and their
intelligence. It is not the government’s role to define reality.

Existing legislation is adequate to deal with online material of a violent or illegal or abhorrent nature.
New legislation that includes definitions that are vague or open to misuse is not needed or
desirable.

A worrying evolution of the new legislation is presented by Attachment 1: “Graduated application of
the ACMA powers”, which suggests an open-ended process with the “voluntary code framework”
giving way to use of “regulatory levers” allowing the ACMA to specify industry standards to suit the
needs of the government of the day. Service providers and owners of digital platforms will be the
censors, anxious to avoid penalties. We have only recently learned that US platforms such as
Twitter and Facebook were pressured into censoring their users’ postings over the last two years.

The proposed amendment is unnecessary and open to misuse. It facilitates censorship,
suppression of free speech and control of access to information.

Yours faithfully,

Deborah Kelton
