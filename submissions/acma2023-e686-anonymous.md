I wish to make a submission regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. People want to come to Australia because it is a free (used to be) country. However Bills such as this
one are intent on stripping citizens of our freedoms.

Sadly we have become a society where people are becoming 'offended' by what used to be considered fun or just friendly
banter.

This bill grants excessive power to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to regulate and restrict the public's
access to diverse information, while at the same time exempting all governmental publications from scrutiny.

The vagueness of the standards as well as the severity of the proposed fines threatened in this bill will cause digital platforms to
actively shut down any discussions or opinions which could possibly be considered controversial – limiting the public's ability to
challenge prevailing narratives and engage in meaningful debate.

A society that values free speech must be willing to protect even the most unpopular opinions – as long as they are stated in good
faith and are not threatening or libellous – because the exchange of ideas is essential for intellectual growth and the protection of
individual rights.

I urge the Department to champion the inalienable right of every individual to freely express his thoughts and beliefs in good faith.
Please reject the influence of unelected individuals from overseas who are trying to force upon us their ideologies - totalitarian
ones at that. When has communism really helped a society? Let's go back to teaching our children true history so that they will
grow up knowing what to avoid.
Yours most sincerely,
