# “No one can get up much enthusiasm for a Government which puts you in jail if you open your mouth” George Orwell

I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed "Disinformation and Misinformation
Bill" set to beintroduced on August 20th.

How can the Government decide what is truth and what is fiction? The road to tyranny is
always laid with good intentions. Free speech must remain intact so all sides can be heard.
How are we to know the thoughts and beliefs of others if we are all to walk in lockstep? I
would like the right to hear someone out and decide for myself what I believe. Giving me the
opportunity to avoid people at my own digression.

This egregious overreach of government power is a direct assault on free speech and the

liberty of all Australians. We must welcome open debate and democratic values.
