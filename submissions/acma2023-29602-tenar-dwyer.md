Submission in response to New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation

I could waste my time writing a long, well referenced submission outlining all the
reasons why this bill is a terrible idea. I could point out all the countries and regimes
in history, which have used censorship (which lets admit that this is exactly what this
bill is proposing) to shore up their own power and criminalise their opponents or
anyone who threatens their grip on power.

I could point out how the last three years of censorship and narrative pushing have
lead to untold disability and death. I could spend a lot of time on why this new law is
dangerous and undemocratic and completely goes against everything our country
should stand for, but I’m not going to as the it is entirely self-evident that this is a
absolutely diabolical bill and Blind Freddy can see this is a dangerous bill that should
not have seen the light of day.

The authors of it need to be ashamed for even touching this bill and to have been a
part of drafting it. The people who think this bill is a good idea DO NOT HAVE
AUSTRALIA’S BEST INTEREST at heart. This bill tells me my government wants to
propagandise me, and my fellow Australians and as such I oppose this bill with every
fibre of my being.

I oppose this bill because I lived through the last three years of censorship and
labeling inconvenient to the narrative information as ‘misinformation and
disinformation’. I oppose this bill because it is horrendously dangerous for our
democracy and gives the government too much power and allows for too much
corruption if misused.

If this bill goes through it will signal to me, as an Australian Citizen, is that I should
NEVER EVER trust a single word that comes out of the government’s mouth. After
the ABSOLUTE DISASTER of the last three years - a direct result of censorship and
labeling of the truth as misinformation – if this bill goes through I would be a
COMPLETE FOOL to accept anything the government said as factual.

How about instead of trying to control us, and telling us what we should think, you
actually treat us like the adults we are, with brains in our head and the capacity to
understand complex information and decide for ourselves what is in our, and our
family’s best interests.

This is a dangerous law. It should NOT be allowed to pass.
