To whom it may concern,

I am very concerned that government thinks it has the power to

decide what constitutes misinformation and disinformation. No

one body is the arbiter of all information in the whole world, this

is simply impossible.

We source our information from many outlets including directly

from someone who is in the middle of a situation. It is entirely

possible that the information divulged by that person is entirely

true and gives a unique perspective on a situation. But because

their personal experience does not fit with a mainstream

narrative they must be lying at worst or misinforming or

providing disinformation.

Who is the government to tell me this person’s actual experience

is not true? How does government know? Fact checkers on

social media are not infallible, neither are they all seeing, all

knowing, omnipotent beings who can see into the lives and

experiences of everyone right across the globe.

To say I find the proposed bill an overreach is an

understatement. George Orwell’s Thought Police come to mind.

Having the freedom to have an opinion and to voice that opinion

is true democracy. People may not like what I have to say but I

ought to be able to say it. Most people are reasonable they are
