Subject: Submission regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the request for comment on the proposed
“Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023”.

I cannot, in all good conscience, support the “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023” proposed legislation for the following reasons:

  - The Australian Human Rights Commission, on their website
[(https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/rights-and-freedoms/freedom-information-opinion-](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/rights-and-freedoms/freedom-information-opinion-and-expression)
[and-expression) states the following that Australia agreed to the UN General Assembly](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/rights-and-freedoms/freedom-information-opinion-and-expression)
adoption of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 16
December 1966. The above website states:
◦ “ICCPR Article 19 states:

   - Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

   - Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include

freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other
media of his choice.

   - The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph above of this article carries with

it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain
restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:

         - ( a ) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

         - ( b ) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health
or morals.

   - General Comment 34 emphasises that freedom of expression and opinion are the

foundation stone for a free and democratic society and a necessary condition for the
promotion and protection of human rights.”

◦ The above ICCPR confirms that our freedom to express our own opinion is our right. It

has been noted that with every right comes a responsibility. There are many laws already
in place which provision against publishing incorrect or misleading information,
therefore this bill is generally superfluous.

  - The basic pretext of the bill is “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the
safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy” and
mitigating that perceived risk. Upon what facts is this based? The sources of this
information is posted by people who one would think are acting responsibly in the first
place. How and what they're posting is/can be interpreted is a very subjective matter and is
open to interpretation by those who read it. The premise that a service provider, organisation
and/or platform, etc could be held accountable isn't realistic as they didn't post it – they're
just providing the means which is akin to printing out an opinion and distributing it through
the various existing traditional means such as post or passing it through word of mouth.


-----

  - The report “ACMA's June 2021 Report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms'
disinformation and news quality measures” quotes various misinformation and/or
disinformation references. It has since been proven that fact-checkers at the time may have
seemed to make accurate reports, however, time has proven otherwise. Over the last 2 years
multiple articles, as a result of careful investigations, have revealed that misinformation
and/or disinformation is extremely subjective.

  - In the “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 Guidance Note June 2023”, “Scenario 2: Information-gathering
powers” (Page 16) illustrates an example of where the judgement is disputed. The
assumption that a post has resulted in “causes significant health issues leading to widespread
concern and an increase in vandalism of telecommunications infrastructure” illustrates the
complete unrealistic pretext of this bill. It is an extremely subjective assumption and without
mention of specific proof that the individuals who performed the vandalism are directly
related to the posting illustrates the flawed nature of this bill. Not to mention they are
responsible for their own actions thus would need to be prosecuted under the law. The
pretext that any individual or organisation could be held to account for their actions is false.

  - Considering the huge penalties for a business/organisation and an individual are based on a
subjective opinion by “fact checkers” rather than an actual outcome is completely
unreasonable. What constitutes a “threat” doesn't appear to be specifically quantifiable
therefore the outcomes would not achieve the intended purpose as stated.

The premise that the ACMA, any other agency/government department (eg. Australian Department
of Home Affairs) or third party that ACMA requests fact checked information from could be 100%
accurate is flawed. It has been shown that in the many cases the results have been extremely
subjective. Furthermore, time has proved that the actions taken have been based on inaccurate
conclusions. Assuming for the moment that this bill had already been enacted, what would have
been the outcome and how many injustices would have transpired? If the bill does proceed, how
could we, the people, be certain of the integrity of the process and therefore it's outcome? I think
not.

From the above I would recommend that the whole pretext of this legislation and any future
version(s) be withdrawn completely and allow the freedom of speech and the sharing of information
to continue along with their associated accountability and responsibilities so the people can decide
what is and isn't correct or valid.

I therefore cannot, in all good conscience, support the “Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023” proposed legislation in any form and
request it's complete withdrawal.

I look forward to the outcome of these deliberations.

Yours faithfully,
