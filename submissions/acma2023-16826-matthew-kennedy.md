**-** **Socrates**

If this legislation passes - and as stated, a potential “stronger form of regulation” in the future,

we as a country and a global society are driving ourselves closer to an Orwellian and dystopian

world where government and corporations decide what is true and what is false. Galileo was

killed for propagating what is now considered scientific fact. Socrates was berated for corrupting

the youth and ultimately sentenced to death. How many times must history rhyme for us to

understand that suppression of ideas and speech only leads us to collective ignorance and

suffering?

Rather than directly tackle matters of public health and education, clearly our government

believes that they are who gets to determine what is misinformation, disinformation, lies,

propaganda etc… Everyone should be free to decide what is true and discern fact from fiction.

That is no more than a basic human right. I refuse to roll over and let others determine it for me.

I hope there is actually someone reading this, and that person can see that this is a very

dangerous and slippery slope. Good intentions or not, we cannot in good conscience allow a law

like this to pass. The precedence it sets is a scary one. I’m sure that there are others writing in

with similar arguments. Please listen, please fight this. It’s a matter of principle and morality.
