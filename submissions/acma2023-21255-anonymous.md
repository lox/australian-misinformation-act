**To: Anthony Albanese, Labor Prime Minister / ACMA ‘Combatting Mis and Dis**
**Information’ proposed Legislation.**

I fully reject and prosecute my opposition to the proposed Labor Government’s Mis and Dis
Information ACMA draft legislation.

I want to register my absolute opposition to the Labor government’s draft proposal to combat
online Mis and Dis Information which I consider to be a major impediment and direct threat
to freedom of speech in Australia.

This draft legislation, would grant the Australian Media and Communications Authority
(ACMA) the power to issue massive fines to social media companies that fail to adequately
crack down on misinformation on their platforms.

From reading the information, the draft defines misinformation as information that is “false,
misleading or deceptive; and… reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”.
Who gets to determine this – the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984??

This is a huge gag on free speech of all Australians and is one of the most draconian pieces
of legislation impacting the free speech in Australian society, ever!

What are Labor’s / ACMA understanding and definition of “serious harm,” despite it being the
relevant trigger for action in the prohibition section, I consider this draft to be very poorly
drafted and thought out.

While reading through the proposal I’m shocked to find out that state and federal
governments would be exempted. Why? So governments can tell lies, spread Mis and Dis
Information that they rebrand to call truth. But individual Australians can be banned from
challenging it?

This Labor Govt’s proposal gives ACMA the power to force social media companies to
change how they deal with Mis and Dis Information and will adversely affect individual
Australians.

It’s highly probable then that these powers would lead media companies and internet
platforms to be extremely wary of the threat of fines and costs of having to defend
themselves - this would lead to excessive over censorship of Australians. Conversely it
would give the Australian Federal government open slather to say whatever truth it saw fit to
deliver upon fellow Australians without consequence and without the right of rebuttal /
reprisal.

It’s an absolute ‘NO’ from me to the Labor government’s Mis and Dis Information ACMA
proposed draft Legislation.
