# Submission in respect to the proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023. 23 July 2023

 The framers of the Cons�tu�on of the United States so understood the importance of freedom of speech and conscience to liberal democracy that it was enshrined in the First Amendment (1789):

 “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of
the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
grievances.”

Australia may not be America with a clearly stated right of freedom of speech, but Australia is a
liberal democracy, inheritor of the rights of “Free Englishmen” that has been carried down from
laws of England. While not an absolute right, liberal democracy requires freedom of speech. It is
through unfettered free exchange of ideas, whether political, scientific, or religious, that we move
forward as a society.

The type of societies that restrict freedom of speech are tyrannies and dictatorships. Australia
has a long history of calling out and opposing those countries that oppressed their people’s right
of free speech, such as North Korea, China, and Iran, and yet, with this proposed law Australia
aligns itself with these illiberal nations.

Whatever ‘noble’ intents this legislation may propose to serve right now, it will inevitably descend
to suppression of all speech that the government of the day dislikes. We do not need to search
far for precedents in our day. In the 2020 US election, evidence of criminal activity by candidate
Biden’s son, Hunter, through the disclosures on his laptop, were suppressed by social media
companies under the false claim that this was ‘disinformation.’ We now know that the disclosures
were true. One may argue that ‘we’ would not do such thing, but the past three years have
shown that the terms ‘misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation’ have been vaguely
applied to suppress all manner of public expression where it diverged from the government’s
preferred narratives. Subsequently, it has been repeatedly shown that many of the government’s
narratives were in fact disinformation (i.e., knowingly false).

This raises the question who defines ‘misinformation’ etc? How do we ensure that any judgement
of mis or disinformation is open and subject to appropriate challenge? How do we ensure that
commercial interests do not influence these outcomes? We have already observed that

What

transparency can be expected? The legislation says nothing on this so we must assume it will
end up in the hands of parties which do not have the public’s best interest at heart.

Under the threat of substantial fines, the social media companies and all digital platforms will
automatically be incentivized to suppress all potentially controversial speech. There will be an
immediate chilling of all political discourse in this country.

**Censorship is a threat to democracy**

I ran as a candidate for a minor political party during the 2022 Australian Federal election. I
experienced firsthand how platforms such as Facebook censored and suppressed political
expression during the election in this country. My own posts discussing economic policy,
responsible spending and censorship themselves shadow banned, suppressed and deleted with
vague claims of breaching ‘terms of service’ etc. Comments and critiques on the statements by

the major parties were often flagged as abuse, deleted or blocked. Censorship is already
occurring in this country but is hidden. The effect of this secretive censorship is fundamentally
corrosive to our democracy and can only become worse under a formalized censorship regime,
where all inconvenient criticism of the government and its policies will eventually be suppressed
by labelling them as misinformation.

**Existing legal recourse**

The legislative fact sheet uses spurious justifications for these laws when in fact existing legal
recourse exists. For instance, it is already illegal to promote racism, criminal activities, terrorism
online. Vandalism, threats and actual violence are already crimes. Does anyone actually believe
that anyone in the entire world injected themselves with bleach to combat a ‘viral infection’? This
is nonsense and could be defined as disinformation in and of itself. With existing recourse
already existing, why does the government want additional powers to suppress free speech?

Without freedom of speech, there will be no freedom of conscience for we are denied the right to
express our conscience in public discourse, which in these days is largely expressed through
social media. In a world without freedom of speech the people will ultimately be made voiceless;
serfs who are told what is right for them, without right of means to reply. That the World
Economic Forum and the World Health Organization have called for expanded powers to
suppress speech is telling and tells us all we need to know.

Yours faithfully
