# Proposed Bill: ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation
 I speak on behalf of my fellow Australian’s when I say, we do not consent to have any of our freedom’s relinquished or removed under any such proposal. 

20 August 2023

The proposal to give ACMA - an un-elected bureaucracy - power to “combat”
misinformation and disinformation is an affront to the representative government we
“claim” to have in Australia. It is an idea based on kneejerk reactions to the current
political climate and purports to erode the very fabric of our society. In this country
we have free speech. It has been fought for by the people before us and will be
fought for by us, and the people that follow for generations to come. Fact checkers
from social media have shut down and blocked debate on many topics recently
without any regulation and with total disregard for open honest and robust debate. In
an open and democratic society this is nothing short of totalitarianism and
communism.
Australians are fair and honest people who are tolerant of other cultures and
embrace multiculturalism. These views are being eroded by left wing dictatorship
views and the belief that we should be silenced if our views do not match the
Governments narrative. I do not believe this country needs or wants this Bill
introduced and it should be abolished before it is even tabled in Parliament. Some of
the points that need to be raised are as follows and should be taken as follows.

Who has the authority to claim what is Information (known actionable truth),
Disinformation or Misinformation, or the new buzzword, Malinformation dictate to any
individual on how to decide if such information is true, real or factual. Meaning,
anyone presented with such information as a free an independent man or woman
can, at present decide for themselves which is true and correct or disputed in any
context or form without bias, prejudice or coercion and decide for themselves
accordingly.

Taking away such liberties of all or any Australian’s such as these will remove free
speech and panders to a global ideology that we are not capable of thinking for
ourselves. This Bill will erode and dictate the future direction of the country in more
ways than anyone can possibly imagine for years to come and I totally reject the
proposal.

Craig Harman
