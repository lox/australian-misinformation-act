I, express total and deep concern and opposition to the Combating Misinformation and

Disinformation Bill proposed by the Albanese Government.

I am seriously concerned that the proposed new powers will threaten freedom of speech and
democratic rights in Australia in the following ways:

The Bill grants the government the authority to define truth, allowing them to control and
manipulate the flow of information.

Whilst imposing restrictions on online platforms, the Bill gives the government and mainstream
media a free pass, creating a double standard and eroding the principles of fairness and equality.

The Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to determine what
qualifies as “misinformation” or “disinformation”. This subjective definition leaves room for abuse of
power and suppresses public debate and diverse opinions and perspectives.

The Bill effectively enables tech companies to become tools of government censorship, stifling free
speech and undermining the open exchange of ideas.

The Bill paves and allows the way for ideological conformity, suppressing dissenting voices and
hindering independent thought. This goes against the principles of a democratic society that thrives
on diversity and freedom of expression.

I strongly urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental rights of every
Australian citizen as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression. This right includes the freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of
frontiers.

Anything less will cause serious, detrimental, implications for free speech and democracy in
Australia. I strongly urge the Australian government to uphold the principles of transparency and
accountability and foster an environment where open debate and diverse opinions are welcome, as
they should be.
