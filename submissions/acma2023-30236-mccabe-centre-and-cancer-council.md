### Consultation: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

#### About us
The McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer is working for a world free from preventable cancers and in
which all people affected by cancer have equitable access to safe, effective, and affordable treatment
and care. The McCabe Centre is a Melbourne-based joint initiative of Cancer Council Victoria, the
Union for Cancer Control and Cancer Council Australia. The McCabe Centre conducts world-leading
legal research, policy development, and capacity building programs to promote the use of law as an
essential tool in the prevention and control of cancer in Australia and overseas. The McCabe Centre
is a WHO Collaborating Centre on Law and Noncommunicable Disease, and the WHO Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control Knowledge Hub on Legal Challenges.

Cancer Council Australia is Australia’s peak national non-government cancer control organisation and
advises the Australian Government and other bodies on evidence-based practices and policies to
help prevent, detect and treat cancer.

The McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer and Cancer Council Australia welcomes the opportunity to
make a submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As agencies concerned about the proliferation of misinformation about
cancer causes and treatments on digital platforms, we are pleased to see action in this area.

We support the intent of the Bill to address the growing challenge of misinformation and
disinformation in Australia, through a co-regulatory approach that reserves regulatory powers to the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to act if voluntary industry efforts are
inadequate.

We comment substantively on one area of the Bill, in relation to health misinformation and harm to
the health of Australians.

#### Recommendations

1. The prevalence of misinformation about cancer on digital platforms, together with the risk of

serious harm as a result, means cancer misinformation should be a key focus area for this
Bill.

2. The way this Bill regulates health misinformation needs to be consistent with existing legal

and regulatory frameworks, and effective systems and processes should be in place to
ensure coordination with relevant agencies.

3. Combatting misinformation upholds Australia’s human rights obligations, including the right

to health and the right to freedom of expression. In framing of the right to freedom of
expression the Bill should acknowledge that the right to freedom of expression is not an
absolute right, and some limits to this right can be justified.

4. A co-regulatory framework must be accompanied by initiatives to counter misinformation,

including supporting collaborative patient-clinician relationships. All sectors, including

3


-----

governments and health organisations, should invest in digital education and media health
literacy initiatives, conduct fact-checking and content labelling interventions, and support
multisectoral collaboration between governments, policymakers, digital platforms and
community-based organisations to address health misinformation.

#### Health misinformation and serious harm
The term ‘misinformation’ in the Bill is intended to capture content that is disseminated on a digital
service, where that content is false, misleading or deceptive, and where the provision of that content
on the service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

For the purposes of this submission, we use the term ‘misinformation’ to mean both misinformation
and disinformation.

For misinformation to be covered by the powers, it must be reasonably likely that it would cause or
contribute to serious harm. For harm to be serious, it is intended that it must have severe and widereaching impacts on Australians. Subclause 7(3) outlines the matters that are relevant to determining
whether the content could cause or contribute to serious harm:

  - the circumstances in which the content is disseminated

  - the subject matter of the false, misleading or deceptive information in the content

  - the potential reach and speed of the dissemination

  - the severity of the potential impacts of the dissemination

  - the author of the information

  - the purpose of the dissemination

  - whether the information has been attributed to a source and, if so, the authority of the
source and whether the attribution is correct

  - other related false, misleading or deceptive information disseminated

  - any other relevant matter.

Clause 2 of the Bill contains a definition of ‘harm’ and outlines types of harm that would be
considered. This includes harm to the health of Australians. The Guidance Note for the Bill gives the
following as an example of serious harm to health: “Misinformation that caused people to ingest or
inject bleach products to treat a viral infection”.

We are pleased to see the definition of harm includes harm to the health of Australians. We know
that many people use the internet and social media to seek and source health information,[1] and
digital platforms play an important role in the dissemination of evidence-based health information.

At the same time however, health misinformation has proliferated on digital platforms, with serious
effects. Health misinformation is linked to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality[2] and can
hinder the delivery of evidence-based medicine and negatively affect relationships between health
practitioners and their patients.[3] Health information is easily absorbed through digital media, and
while this is a significant benefit for the distribution of evidence based health information, the
prevalence of misinformation alongside accurate information means that many people have
difficulty discerning which sources of information are credible.[4] According to the World Health

4


-----

Organization (WHO) on some social media platforms, falsehoods are 70% more likely to get shared
than accurate news.[5] The WHO referred to the proliferation of false and misleading information
during the COVID 19 pandemic as an ‘infodemic’ and commenced a programme of work to combat
misinformation online. In Australia, ACMA’s misinformation report found 4 in 5 Australians had seen
misinformation about COVID-19, with 22% seeing ‘a lot’ or ‘a great deal’.[6] The same report noted
high public support of joint action by individuals, platforms and governments to reduce the amount
of false or misleading information online.[7] This makes addressing health misinformation on digital
platforms a critical public health goal.[8]

The health misinformation example provided in the Guidance Note for the Bill relates to the COVID19 pandemic, and we acknowledge the very damaging effect of misinformation during the COVID-19
pandemic.

We also wish to highlight the persistent and long-standing issue of cancer misinformation, and the
impacts of this misinformation. On most media sharing and social media platforms, misinformation
about the causes and treatment of noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, are the most
prevalent topics.[9] Nearly one-third of popular social media cancer articles contained misinformation
and 76.9% of these contained harmful information.[10]

Misinformation spans the cancer control continuum and can affect cancer prevention, screening,
diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. Cancer misinformation includes inaccurate and misleading
information about what causes cancer; the promotion of alternative and unproven therapies; the
financial costs of unproven alternative therapies and ‘fake cancer cures’; and the actions of
unscrupulous actors and unregistered health service providers in promoting and profiting from
unproven cancer therapies.[11] Misinformation about the composition of sunscreens and marketing of
‘safer alternatives’ to sunscreen have led to nearly half of survey respondents believing sunscreens
contain chemicals that are bad for you; while 2 in 5 Australians incorrectly believe that alternative
therapies can cure cancer.[12]

#### Cancer misinformation: alternative and unproven cancer therapies
Alternative cancer therapies are commonly defined as cancer treatments used in the place of
conventional medicine. They are usually untested and unproven, with no efficacy to prevent cancer
growing or spreading. Other therapies have been tested and shown not to work. The side effects of
alternative therapies are not always known; some alternative therapies can be harmful, expensive
and can negatively impact the effective management of cancer symptoms.

Alternative cancer therapies are differentiated from complementary cancer therapies, which are
various treatments and medicines that are used concurrently with conventional medicine to relieve
some of the side effects of conventional cancer therapy and support the general well-being of
patients. Complementary cancer therapies are not a cure for cancer and are not promoted as such.

Examples of therapies which are promoted as alternatives to evidence-based cancer treatments
(such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) include herbs, supplements and high-dose
vitamins, and special diets and eliminating food groups, as well as mind-body techniques like

5


-----

meditation, relaxation and spiritual healing. Other alternative therapies offered as cancer cures
include ozone therapy and high dose intravenous vitamin C therapy.

We note that on media sharing platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest, and on social
network platforms, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, health misinformation about
noncommunicable diseases and treatments are the most prevalent topics.[13] A 2021 study found
that between 2018 and 2019, nearly one-third of popular social media cancer articles contained
misinformation and 76.9% of these contained harmful information.[14] Most concerning, among the
most popular articles on Facebook, articles containing misinformation and harmful information
received statistically significantly more online engagement.[15]

Health service providers or others promoting alternative therapies often falsely promote their
treatments and medicines as cures for cancer and may even encourage the cessation of conventional
evidence-based cancer therapies. Patients may be charged exorbitant fees for unproven therapies.
Where alternative therapies lead to patients either stopping or delaying conventional treatment, this
may have serious consequences. In cancer care, the use of unproven therapies is associated with
decreased survival.[16]

**Recommendation 1:**
The prevalence of misinformation about cancer on digital platforms, together with the risk of serious
harm as a result, means cancer misinformation should be a key focus area for this Bill.

#### Shared responsibility for misinformation
Combatting health misinformation is a regulatory responsibility shared between different federal,
state and territory government agencies.

There are overlapping regulatory frameworks regulating registered and unregistered health
practitioners and health services; and regulating the advertising and promotion of alternative
unproven cancer care. These include:

  - The Australian Health Practitioner Regional Agency and National Boards, which handle
complaints about registered health practitioners and develops standards, codes and
guidelines for the profession.

  - Health complaints entities in states and territories, which handle general complaints about
health services and administer the National Code of Conduct for Healthcare Workers, which
sets out a range of minimum standards for health services and health care workers.
Relevantly, this Code mandates that health care workers must not claim or represent they are
qualified, able or willing to cure cancer or other terminal illnesses; and that a health worker
who claims to be able to treat or alleviate the symptoms of cancer or other terminal illnesses
must be able to substantiate such claims.

  - Australian Consumer Law and state consumer protection laws, which prohibit false,
misleading or deceptive conduct, and have been used with some success to challenge the
promotion of fake cancer cures.

  - The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and associated Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code (No. 2).
One of the key objectives of the Code is to ensure that the advertising of therapeutic goods to

the public is conducted in a manner that is ethical and does not mislead or deceive the
consumer or create unrealistic expectations about product performance.

**Recommendation 2:**
The way this Bill regulates health misinformation needs to be consistent with existing legal and
regulatory frameworks, and effective systems and processes should be in place to ensure
coordination with relevant agencies.

#### Misinformation and human rights
Australia is a party to several international human rights treaties that affirm the right to health,
principally, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which
provides for the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. It is the
primary responsibility of states to progressively protect, respect and fulfil the right to health, which
includes creating a regulatory environment that supports this.

The right to health includes the right to access to credible health information for people to make
informed decisions about their healthcare. Inaccurate information about health care and disease
prevention, such as false information on risks associated with vaccines, may deter people from taking
healthcare decisions that protect their health and put others at risk.[17] Therefore, taking steps to
combatting misinformation that harms health is in fulfillment of Australia’s obligations under
international human rights law. Corporations including digital media platforms also have a distinct
duty to respect human rights, as recognised in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights.[18]

A further dimension to misinformation and human rights is the obligation on governments to protect
the rights of health experts and healthcare workers who are subjected to online abuse when
conveying credible and evidence-based health information. This was most visible during the COVID19 pandemic—a Nature News survey of COVID-19 researchers reported 81% of respondents said
they had experienced personal attacks or trolling after speaking to the media about COVID-19, and
70% reported at least one kind of negative impact after speaking to the media ranging from physical
threats to experiencing emotional distress.[19] Health care workers and COVID-19 experts in Australia
experienced similar attacks and abuse.[20] In this case, misinformation—and the undermining and
silencing of expert health information—risk both harm to the personal health and safety of health
experts, as well as to public health, and must be addressed.

The concept of freedom of speech has been used and misused to permit online abuse. However,
attitudes and regulatory responses towards online harassment have changed, particularly as victims
of online abuse have shared their experiences[21] and there is greater acceptance of the need, and
indeed the responsibility of governments, to intervene when the expressive rights of experts are
being interfered with.

Subsection 3AC of the Bill declares an intent for digital platform services to be regulated to prevent
and respond to misinformation and disinformation, in a manner that ‘has regard to freedom of
expression’ and other matters including respect for user privacy, protection of the community against
harm cases by misinformation, and public interest considerations. The guidance note for the Bill also

references balancing freedom of expression with the need to address online harm. Here, we would
emphasise that the right to freedom of expression under Article 19 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights can be lawfully limited by governments in certain circumstances, including
for the protection and preservation of the rights of others, and for public health.

**Recommendation 3:**
Combatting misinformation upholds Australia’s human rights obligations, including the right to health
and the right to freedom of expression. In framing of the right to freedom of expression the Bill
should acknowledge that the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right, and some limits
to this right can be justified.

#### Multidisciplinary approaches to tackling health misinformation
We welcome the move to a co-regulatory approach that this Bill signals, noting that self-regulation is
inherently problematic and insufficient to combat misinformation. For example, ACMA’s recent report
on digital platforms’ activities under the voluntary Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and
Misinformation notes the following:

 - The minimal number of complaints received does not align with community concern about
misinformation;

 - Reports by signatories to the Code are insufficient to enable an assessment of their progress to
achieve the Code’s objectives and outcomes;

 - There is an urgent need to improve the level of transparency about what measures platforms are
taking and the effectiveness of those measures.[22]

Legislation is an important way to address health and cancer misinformation, and we welcome the
stronger regulatory response the Bill represents. We also acknowledge that laws and regulation alone
will not be enough. Health misinformation is a complex issue and, requires a multifaceted and
multidisciplinary approach to be effectively addressed.

Addressing misinformation requires sharing of accurate information, but also correcting mistaken
beliefs.[23] Cancer Council Australia’s iHeard website is a resource created to dispel misinformation
about cancer and provide audiences with accurate and scientifically supported information about
cancer. Cancer experts use cognitive science, linguistic, structural and imagery-based techniques to
provide evidence-based answers and explanations to combat misinformation, such as wearing
underwire bras or using deodorants cause cancer.[24] iHeard’s design applies the principles of the
‘inoculation effect’[25] (empowering people to resist misinformation by highlighting common
misconceptions, explaining their flaws, and presenting robust evidence); increasing the presence of
accurate cancer-related facts through Search Engine Optimisation techniques to combat the ‘Illusory
Truth Effect’[26] (where the ubiquitous presence of an idea influences perceptions about its reliability)
and strategies to mitigate the ‘Backfire Effect’[27] (where attempts to refer and combat an idea, may
reinforce that idea). While resources and response such as iHeard are continually being improved,
clinicians and healthcare professionals also have an important role in combatting health
misinformation, through building a relationship of trust and credibility and supporting patients to be
guided by clinical expertise rather than online misinformation.[28]

**Recommendation 4:**
A co-regulatory framework must be accompanied by initiatives to counter misinformation, including
supporting collaborative patient-clinician relationships. All sectors, including governments and health
organisations, should invest in digital education and media health literacy initiatives, conduct factchecking and content labelling interventions, and support multisectoral collaboration between
governments, policymakers, digital platforms and community-based organisations to address health
misinformation.
