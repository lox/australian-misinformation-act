Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600

Dear Senator,

The Fremantle Branch, Liberal Party of Western Australia has agreed that I should
write to you to express our deep concern with the proposed Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023._
This Bill quite simply MUST NOT become law. To have social media platforms with
many links back to China, shutting down what they regard as misinformation or
disinformation plays right in to the heart of destroying our democracy not protecting
it.

Western democracies are in essence being destroyed, they are self-imploding and
the outcome is that Western countries are becoming weaker and poorer whilst other
countries are becoming more powerful. This self-destructing implosion through
radical left-wing policies must be stopped.

Our liberties are being taken away, one liberty at a time by our left-wing Federal
Labor government (and State Labor governments) and we must fight back and resist
these radical authoritarian changes that are being imposed.

Critical thinking, debating and analysing and reaching informed decisions based on
presented information is key to developing ideas and step change improvements,
innovations and inventions to enhance the growth of this dear country.

Strip all this away and we become robots, following the masses, bereft of the ability
to challenge the so called “truths” and we and the nation become stale and stagnant
and we will continue on the slippery slope to decline.

The proposed laws are dangerous as they will not include governments because
supposedly this is where the only source of “truth” is held. We, of course know that
this is nonsense when our governments (at all levels) have been responsible for
many cases of misinformation and disinformation in the past.

As Citizens of this country, we must have the freedom to challenge the so called
“truths” and be able to present an alternative truth if indeed an alternative truth needs
to be articulated without the risk of it being taken down and cancelled.

The Fremantle Branch of the Liberal Party of Western Australia calls upon the MPs
and Senators in our Federal Parliament to vote against these laws to protect the
liberties and freedom of speech for all Australian Citizens in this country.

Yours sincerely,

Jo Stanton
Fremantle Branch President, Liberal Party of Western Australia
