Greetings.

I thank you for many of the great things you do to keep Australians safe. This new bill to do with social
media and misinformation and disinformation is very concerning.

I am a conservative Christian and yes my views vary compared to others and that makes us a great
country.

To think that a handful of humans have the wisdom for checking things on the internet and deciding
what is right and wrong, with authority to remove free speech.

They have their own values, opinions and thoughts can pick and choose what is misinformation or
disinformation is wrong. They will have guidelines which again are written by ppl with their own ideals
and values.

Over the past years many things that were thought to be miss or disinformation have now become
truth. Damage is done already to the people who were speaking out at the time.

Governmentâ€™s job is not to control Australians but to help enhance and keep us as one with free speech,
different opinions, different cultures and faiths. We still have the right to speak out with our different
opinions and debate them. If this comes in then that will disappear.

To fine any social media company for not removing what these 6 ppl disagree with, is almost blackmail.
Do what we say or we will fine you millions. Forcing them to bow to governments demands So of course
they will, they have to even if they disagree. This is wrong.

My only concern for sending in this email and many people will be the same is now you have my details
and I'll go on a large list of people against your views and opinions. But while I still can I will say my bit
before I am silenced through this bill.

I want a free future for our kids. We are told that the world will end in 11 years due to climate change.
So why do we bother, why care.

If this isn't misinformation or disinformation what is?

Which is what they said 11 years ago?

Because that time has passed they now start again. Come on. With a UK doom countdown.

So as you see what is really misinformation and disinformation?

Thanks. Just do what's fair for all Australians not just the ones that agree with you and the government.
