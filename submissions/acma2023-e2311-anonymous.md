Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

## I am an Australian citizen aged years. An ex Police Officer and a Christian. Silencing people only causes anarchy
We need and have a fundamen a right to a voice. Disagreeing or agreeing is a way to have a valuable opinion and
we may not choose the same as others but Government is elected to serve the needs of the people. You have NO
right to silence us for having an opinion. It's healthy and is what separates us from nations under communism and
dictatorships. We have a democratic right 'to have our say'. It's fine if others disagree.

## I am very concerned about the government's proposed "misinformation" law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

The proposed bill will interfere with people's ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a
violation of Australians' human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how
unelected bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

Please reject this bill for the sake of our nation.
