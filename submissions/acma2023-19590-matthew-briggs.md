I strongly object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

My main concern is not with misinformation or disinformation, but the fact that you claim to be able to
determine on our behalf what exactly constitutes mis- or dis-information, and based on that can impose
heavy fines on those you decide are guilty of the same.

Based on the government’s response to Covid-19 – imposing draconian lockdowns and forced
vaccination of citizens (with vaccines that are not capable of preventing transmission or infection) and
stay at home orders and the utter denial of people’s innate immunity which has now been shown to
offer way more protection that the vaccines against covid-19 – I am certain that you do not have a
monopoly of truth and are in no position to determine what is and is not mis- or dis-information.

I am sure that the people of Australia are perfectly capable of making up their own minds what
constitutes mis- and dis-information and do not require the government to be the sole arbiters of
“truth”.

Freedom of speech – a basic tenant of democratic societies should allow the people to say whatever
they please and rely of the population to make up their own minds what is true and what is not. Passing
this bill will effectively remove free speech and that is never a good thing.


I would therefore reject any call for this bill to be placed into law.


Thank you for your attention.
