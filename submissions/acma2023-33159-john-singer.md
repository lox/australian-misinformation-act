## Submission re New ACMA powers to combat
# misinformation and disinformation

### In my opinion digital social media is the new town square. A town square should be a free speech area restricted only by prohibition of hate speech and or incitement to violence or insurrection.

 This proposed legislation is too complex and the penalties draconian.

 Too often in recent years matters have been adjudged as conspiracy theories or misinformation by media platforms and/or Fact-checkers only to be later proved to be true and usually after damage to argument or persons has occurred. This has also happened to Government, Official information release and by the National Broadcaster although more frequently to Research Institutes and private comments. Yet while these comments are censored the same media is littered with pornography, scams and misleading advertising.

 ACMA is not an elected body and as such could become politically biased leading to unexpected consequence. I believe the proposed legislation is not a fitting legislation to be produced by a democratic Parliament.
