Good evening

I write to voice my strong disapproval of the Australian Governments proposed ACMA
disinformation/misinformation bill

On the basis of who gets to decide what information is incorrect or correct and the threat of loosing our rites of free
speech I see this proposal as dangerous to our freedom and security

I do not agree with any part of this proposal and urge you to disband the idea in the interest of all citizens of our
great country

Kind regards

Rodney J Smith
