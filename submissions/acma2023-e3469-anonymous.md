Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I believe that the proposed Misinformation Bill attacks the right to free speech which is the cornerstone of a free
democratic society. The Bill is very subjective, and tries to present as facts, things that represent the worldview of
certain people only, which may, or may not be true. Without free speech this can't be challenged, and this would be
very concerning. It seems that the government proposing this is becoming totalitarian, not democratic at all!
Therefore, I believe that this bill is misguided and must be rejected.
