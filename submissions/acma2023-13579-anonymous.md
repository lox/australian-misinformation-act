**Combating Misinformation and Disinformation**

**Subject: Feedback on Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

I am writing to provide feedback on the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. While I appreciate the
government's efforts to address the issue of misinformation and disinformation, I have concerns
regarding certain provisions of the proposed legislation.

Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety, wellbeing, and democratic
processes of Australians. However, it is essential to strike a delicate balance between
combating harmful content and preserving fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech and
privacy. The proposed powers granted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) raise concerns about potential overreach and their impact on freedom of speech and
the open exchange of ideas.

The provision enabling the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers or require
them to keep certain records raises concerns about privacy and potential intrusion into personal
data. While it is crucial to combat harmful content, it is equally important to ensure the protection
of individuals' privacy rights and prevent unnecessary encroachments.

The proposal to request the industry to develop a code of practice to combat misinformation and
disinformation, enforceable by the ACMA, may unintentionally stifle legitimate speech and
diverse perspectives. A code of practice enforced by the ACMA could have a chilling effect on
freedom of expression, hindering public discourse rather than fostering a healthy information
ecosystem.

Additionally, the provision granting the ACMA the authority to create and enforce an industry
standard if a code of practice is deemed ineffective is worrisome. While addressing the
challenges posed by misinformation and disinformation is important, imposing a stronger form of
regulation may disproportionately burden smaller digital platforms and potentially limit innovation
in the industry.

Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that news media outlets also play a significant role in
spreading misinformation and disinformation. To ensure a comprehensive and consistent
approach, news media should also be subject to the same obligations and standards as digital
platforms. This would require news media organizations to adopt responsible reporting
practices, fact-check their content, and provide accurate and unbiased information to the public.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the importance of combating misinformation and
disinformation, I urge you to carefully consider the potential impact of the proposed legislation
on freedom of speech, privacy, and the digital industry's ability to innovate. A balanced approach
that encourages collaboration and education, while subjecting news media to the same

obligations and standards, may prove more effective in addressing this complex issue while
preserving our democratic values. Such an approach would ensure a comprehensive and
consistent framework for combating misinformation and disinformation, regardless of the
medium through which it is disseminated.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I hope that you will take these concerns into account
during the drafting and revision process of the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Yours sincerely,
