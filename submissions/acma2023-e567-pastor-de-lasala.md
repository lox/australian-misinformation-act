The proposal of a misinformation and disinformation bill is cause for great concern. Since when is a government qualified to judge what is truth
or untruth?  Such a concept is in keeping with a totalitarian and communist state and this has no place in our democracy. In effect, such a bill is
abhorrent to the freedom which Australia enjoys. One not look further than the migrants who have come to Australia escaped countries where
totalitarian governments have oppressed the people with draconian laws which deprived them of freedom of speech.  No government has a
right to do this let alone punish those who do not agree with their contrived brand of truth. What is the benchmark for defining what is truth?
Who has the authority to define what is truth or untruth?  The proposed bill is the thin end of the wedge and can only destroy individuality,
prohibit reason and deny discussion. It is also a great threat to religious freedom. I implore the Australian government to withdraw its proposal
forthwith. The Australian people will not and cannot tolerate such a law.
