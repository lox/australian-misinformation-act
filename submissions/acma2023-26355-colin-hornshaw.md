#                            ‘Misinformation’ Bill Submission                   

 The proposed ‘Misinformation’ legislation is a dangerous and Orwellian attack on free speech in Australia and must not become law.

 It is itself misinformation for advocates of the bill to claim that it is not censorship. Yes, citizens may continue to believe what they wish, but their views cannot be published if an unelected ACMA disagrees. It is therefore a secondary form of censorship, enforced by draconian penalties to deter media platforms from publishing anything that is not politically correct.

 It is totally contrary to the Declaration of Human Rights.

 Australia is one of the most multicultural countries in the world, with each group fully entitled to their own worldview, even if these views contradict the views of others: religious diversity, the political spectrum, climate change, sexual orientation, abortion, the Aboriginal industry, etc etc. The list is endless and all views must be tolerated.

 Learned professors of Philosophy could spend years debating ‘what is truth’ or the difference between ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’ truth. It is far beyond the competence of an ACMA committee. Orwell actually raised the concept that 2 +2 might not always equal 4. In our own generation, we cannot now agree even with the concepts of ‘male’ and ‘female’. The homosexual lobby rightly spent many years achieving the toleration to which they are entitled, but will not extend this toleration to anyone that disagrees with them, as Israel Folau and Margaret Court found out.

 IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT AN UNELECTED ACMA COMMITTEE MIGHT NOW DECLARE ANY OPPOSING VIEWS TO BE MISINFORMATION.
