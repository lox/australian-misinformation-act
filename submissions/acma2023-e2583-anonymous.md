Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Freedom of speech is every Australian's fundamental right. The proposed 'misinformation' law is taking away those
rights by a government that is meant to uphold them, not suppress them.

No government has the wisdom of capability to discern what is true and what is not. With all the information available
at our fingertips at this day and age, this has never happened before. It's an impossible task. The amount of
information that can be accessed on the internet is vast. Who could possibly judge what are true and false statements
on every subject?

This bill's stated aim is to keep us from 'harm'. And protecting us is a good thing, but the issue here is that this
proposed law will do more harm than good. One example is the recent pandemic and the question where did
COVID-19 originate from? It was originally stated that it came from nature, and that the lab origin was 'misinformation'
and this could harm our relationship with China.

We know now that COVID-19 did likely come from the Wuhan lab. This 'misinformation' is now quite possibly the truth!
This is so vital to know, so that we can avoid repeating this mistake. Censoring truthful reporting will itself cause
'harm' by preventing us from learning from our mistakes.

With this one example, we can see how this 'misinformation' proposed law will increase 'harm' where it seeks to
prevent it.

This bill is misguided and must be rejected.
