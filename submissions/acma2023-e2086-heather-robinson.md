# Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023:

 SUBMISSION:

 I believe we do not need such a bill. I do not need such a bill. It would be most confusing for very many people. We should be taught to speak/write honestly, always. That same teaching should begin at home as soon as a child can speak, and should continue throughout school. If someone is not speaking honestly they should be reminded of that rule, and if necessary, they should be reprimanded or punished. The reason for the necessity of honesty always, should be explained to the child/offender.

 If dishonesty is permitted then the whole of society is on an unsure footing.

 There are one or two countries where dishonesty is allowed, for various reasonsâ€”e.g., if it suits the user. I am very glad I do not live in such a society. That attitude would harm the fabric of Australian society and should never be permitted in Australia.

 I totally condemn the use of dishonesty in either act or deed or the spoken word.

            oooOOOooo
