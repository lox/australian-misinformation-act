The “Misinformation Bill” is an attack on free speech..

Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a free and fair society. It is a fundamental value of Australia. Despite denials to the
contrary, the proposed bill will erode this fundamental human right. If you politicians and the public give totalitarian powers to
government it will eventually be used against you and the public.

The internet has become the ‘town square’ where the latest ideas can be debated. Now people can send factual information
(often contrary to the government position) around the world in an instant, as well as spread false ideas. There are positives and
negatives to modern technology. But setting up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer. The government needs to
ensure that the media does act as the censors of "truth".

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.

What position do you intend to take on this bill?
