Dear Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)

I write regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

In summary, it is eerily similar to decrees handed down by the Soviet Union in 1918, Italy in 1923,
Germany in 1933, Soviet controlled Eastern Europe in the late 1940s, China in 1955 (with the
publication of State Council Instructions on How to Deal with Anti-revolutionary, Obscene, and
Preposterous Books, Magazines, and Pictures), North Korea in 1956, North Vietnam in 1956, Cuba
1959, Vietnam in 1975, Iran in 1979, Zimbabwe in 2001 and Venezuela in 2009 ... plus every other
###### dictatorship in history.

None of these dictatorships came to power with the promise of restricting speech. Often they
claimed to be champions of free speech. When Benito Mussolini created a ‘High Commission for
###### the Press’ in 1929 he claimed speech would remain free ... except for 'activity contrary to the
national interest.’ Every oppressive state has claimed the same thing: ‘yeah, yeah we’re pro-free
speech except for one-off emergencies.’

The Commonwealth Government doesn’t crave this power to suppress alternate views on
COVID related matters      - that hysteria has passed. The COVID experience however demonstrated
###### that despite endless government and corporate narrative enforcement, the masses will stop
listening to overhyped alarmism from the state and big business. The Commonwealth is still
pleading with us to take a fifth COVID injection while the much-maligned sceptics urge caution

... and almost nil have taken the fifth shot. The state finally lost that narrative war. This legislation
is about not losing the next one.

Let's cut to the chase: this Bill is about strengthening narrative enforcement around the
###### ultimate big government crusade - the ‘settled science’ of ‘global boiling.’

The Bill's Exposure Draft lists the various opinions to be classified as worthy of banning and
includes, ‘harm to the Australian environment.’ The science of global boiling is so settled, the
Commonwealth needs law to suppress alternate views. Rather than politicians, bureaucrats and
CEOs doing some quiet soul-searching about the last time they censored alternate views, they
are preoccupied with not losing control of the narrative again.

Free speech is moral. While it is true that many fringe ideas are best left on the fringe, it is
undeniable that most forward leaps for mankind occurred because a fringe idea was given a
platform and won the debate. Suppressing free speech will suppress good new ideas.

Robert F Kennedy Jr. recently said, _‘There_ _was_ _no_ _time_ _in_ _history_ _where_ _the_ _people_ _censoring_
_free_ _speech_ _were_ _the_ _good_ _guys.'_

Here are five examples:

###### SOCRATES

Today Socrates is remembered as the greatest of the great minds of Ancient Greece. In 399 BC,
however, Socrates was put on trial for the crime of saying things the political class didn't like
being said ... and in particular convincing young minds the Athenians gods were fictitious. No­
one believes in those gods today, but insecure politicians considered mocking these non-gods
###### to be a capital crime.

 At the trial, Socrates' accusers outlined his wrong-think to the 500 jurors ... and then Socrates
had the right of reply which his student Plato recorded in Apology (391 BC).

###### What do they say? That Socrates is a doer of evil and a corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state and has other new divinities of
_his_ _own_ _and_ _he_ _teaches_ _these_ _doctrines_ _to_ _others?’_

_They_ _told_ _you_ _to_ _not_ _to_ _let_ _yourselves_ _be_ _deceived_ _by_ _the_ _force_ _of_ _my_ _eloquence._
_They_ _ought_ _to_ _have_ _been_ _ashamed_ _of_ _saying_ _this_ _unless_ _by_ _‘force_ _of_ _eloquence’_
###### they mean the force of truth; for then I do indeed admit that I am eloquent.

_I_ _went_ _to_ _one_ _who_ _had_ _the_ _reputation_ _of_ _wisdom._ _He_ _was_ _a_ _politician._ _When_ _I_
###### began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself. I tried to explain to him that while he thought himself wise he was not really wise. The consequence was that he hated me and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. Then I went to another, who had still higher philosophical pretensions. My conclusion was exactly the same and I made another enemy of him and of many others besides him.

 And I swear to you, Athenians, for I must tell you the truth - / found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some inferior men were really wiser and better.

_This_ _investigation_ _has_ _led_ _to_ _my_ _having_ _many_ _enemies_ _of_ _the_ _worst_ _and_ _most_ _dangerous_
_kind,_ _and_ _has_ _given_ _occasion_ _also_ _to_ _many_ _slanders,_

###### And this, O men ofAthens, is the truth and the whole truth. Yet I know that this plainness of speech makes them hate me, and what is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking
_the_ _truth?_

###### And therefore if you pardon me, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my
_words._

###### Ifyou say to me, ‘Socrates, this time we will let you off, but upon one condition, that you
_are_ _not_ _to_ _inquire_ _and_ _speculate_ _in_ _this_ _way_ _anymore_ _and_ _that_ _if_ _you_ _are_ _caught_ _doing_
_this_ _again_ _you_ _shall_ _die.'_

###### If this was the condition on which you let me go, I should reply: ‘Men of Athens, I honour and love you; but I shall obey God rather than you. While I have life and strength I shall
_never_ _cease_ _from_ _the_ _practice_ _and_ _teaching_ _of_ _philosophy._ _I_ _will_ _exhort_ _anyone_ _whom_ _I_
_meet_ _after_ _my_ _manner,_ _and_ _convincing_ _him,_ _saying:_ _‘O_ _my_ _friend,_ _why_ _do_ _you,_ _who_ _are_ _a_
_citizen_ _of_ _the_ _great_ _and_ _mighty_ _and_ _wise_ _city_ _of_ _Athens,_ _care_ _so_ _much_ _about_ _laying_ _up_
_the_ _greatest_ _amount_ _of_ _money_ _and_ _honour_ _and_ _reputation,_ _and_ _so_ _little_ _about_ _wisdom_
###### and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at
_all?_ _Are_ _you_ _not_ _ashamed_ _of_ _this?’_

_Wherefore,_ _O_ _men_ _of_ _Athens,_ _I_ _say_ _to_ _you,_ _either_ _acquit_ _me_ _or_ _not;_ _but_ _whatever_ _you_ _do,_
###### know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many times. I have
_something_ _more_ _to_ _say,_ _at_ _which_ _you_ _may_ _be_ _inclined_ _to_ _cry_ _out;_ _but_ _I_ _beg_ _that_ _you_ _will_
###### not do this. I would have you know that, if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure
_yourselves_ _more_ _than_ _you_ _will_ _injure_ _me._ _I_ _would_ _rather_ _die_ _having_ _spoken_ _after_ _my_
_manner,_ _than_ _speak_ _in_ _your_ _manner_ _and_ _live.’_

Socrates was found guilty and killed the following day.

Many of Plato's writings have been lost, so we should be grateful we have this ancient
###### account to learn how vile the state can be when it censors.

###### MARTIN LUTHER

In 1999, the History Channel ranked the 100 most influential figures of the second millennium
AD. This obviously subjective list ranked Martin Luther third.

Luther started out as an obscure German priest. In 1517, Luther was 33 years old and he publicly
released a statement containing 95 criticisms of his church. In summary Luther was urging
ordinary people to think for themselves about religious matters and not blindly obey the church
and its state enforcers. Luther's proclamation (the 95 Theses) quickly went viral across Europe.

The masses began questioning the authority of the church. The Pope sent Luther a demand
###### that he retracts his claims ... so Luther mocked him by publicly burning it. Luther was excommunicated from the church, but his burgeoning movement could not be wished away ...
so the Pope leaned on the German political authorities to silence this free thinker.

Three years into the upheaval, Luther was summoned to a heresy trial. Initially Luther went into
hiding as other ‘heretics’ had attended similar trials and ended up burnt alive. A local prince,
however, who was friendly with Luther guaranteed his safety and so Luther did attend the trial
known as the Diet of Worms. The presiding officer at the trial was the Holy Roman Emperor,
Charles V.

Luther was asked if he would renounce his heresy. He responded in part:

"The accusation consists in my writings against those who, by their wicked doctrines
and precedents, have laid waste Christendom by doing harm to the souls and the
###### bodies of men. No one can either deny or conceal this, for universal experience and world-wide grievances are witnesses to the fact that through the Pope's laws and through man-made teachings, the consciences of the faithful have been most pitifully
ensnared, troubled, and racked in torment, and also that their goods and possessions
have been devoured by unbelievable tyranny.

Your Imperial Majesty and Your Lordships demand a simple answer. Here it is, plain and
###### unvarnished. Unless I am convinced of error by the testimony of Scripture or by manifest reasoning, I stand convinced by the Scriptures to which I have appealed, and
my conscience is taken captive by God's word, I cannot and will not recant anything, for
###### to act against our conscience is neither safe for us, nor open to us. On this I take my stand. I can do no other. God help me."

The Emperor pronounced a sentence known as the Edict of Worms. The highlights are

_the_ _divine_ _majesty_ _and_ _to_ _keep_ _the_ _Christian_ _religion_ _pure_ _from_ _all_ _heresy_ _or_ _suspicion_ _of_
_heresy._

_For_ _this_ _reason,_ _after_ _having_ _learned_ _of_ _the_ _mistakes_ _and_ _heresies_ _of_ _Martin_ _Luther_ _who_
_teaches_ _iniquity,_ _preaches_ _false_ _doctrines,_ _and_ _writes_ _evil_ _things_ _against_ _our_ _Catholic_ _faith_
###### and the Holy Roman and Universal Church, things which have already been spread throughout almost all of Christendom, greatly diminishing the honour of God and the
_Catholic_ _faith,_ _imperilling_ _and_ _endangering_ _Christian_ _souls,_ _and_ _bringing_ _future_ _confusion_
_to_ _all_ _the_ _public_ _affairs_ _of_ _our_ _Holy_ _Mother_ _Church._ _If_ _we_ _do_ _not_ _put_ _an_ _end_ _to_ _this_
_contagious_ _confusion,_ _it_ _could_ _lead_ _to_ _the_ _corrupting_ _of_ _all_ _faithful_ _nations_ _and_ _to_ _their_
###### falling into abominable schisms.

_The_ _Pope_ _declared_ _his_ _books_ _would_ _have_ _to_ _be_ _burned_ _and_ _taken_ _out_ _of_ _the_ _people's_
_memory_ _forever._ _These_ _books_ _contain_ _as_ _much_ _poison_ _as_ _they_ _have_ _words._

_As_ _far_ _as_ _the_ _said_ _Martin_ _is_ _concerned,_ _if_ _he_ _would_ _not_ _admit_ _that_ _he_ _was_ _wrong_ _and_ _repent,_
_recognizing_ _his_ _mistakes_ _in_ _a_ _given_ _period_ _of_ _time,_ _he_ _would_ _be_ _declared_ _disobedient,_ _child_
###### of iniquity, and heretic. As such, he would have to be arrested, and, consistent with the
_ordinance_ _and_ _the_ _rights,_ _he_ _would_ _have_ _to_ _be_ _punished._ _Martin_ _Luther_ _has_ _not_ _only_ _refused_
_to_ _repent,_ _but_ _this_ _man_ _of_ _wickedness_ _and_ _furore_ _against_ _our_ _faith_ _and_ _against_ _our_ _Mother_
_Church_ _wants_ _to_ _continue_ _spreading_ _the_ _detestable_ _and_ _perverse_ _doctrines_ _of_ _his_ _wicked_
###### and pernicious spirit.

_This_ _man,_ _Martin,_ _is_ _not_ _a_ _man_ _but_ _a_ _demon_ _in_ _the_ _appearance_ _of_ _a_ _man,_ _clothed_ _in_
_religious_ _habit_ _to_ _be_ _better_ _able_ _to_ _deceive_ _mankind,_ _and_ _wanting_ _to_ _gather_ _the_ _heresies_ _of_
_several_ _heretics_ _who_ _have_ _already_ _been_ _condemned,_ _excommunicated,_ _and_ _buried_ _in_ _hell_
_for_ _a_ _long_ _time._ _He_ _is_ _an_ _obstinate,_ _schismatic_ _heretic._

_For_ _this_ _reason_ _we_ _forbid_ _anyone_ _from_ _this_ _time_ _forward_ _to_ _dare,_ _either_ _by_ _words_ _or_ _by_
_deeds,_ _to_ _receive,_ _defend,_ _sustain,_ _or_ _favor_ _the_ _said_ _Martin_ _Luther._ _Those_ _who_ _will_ _help_ _in_ _his_
_capture_ _will_ _be_ _rewarded_ _generously_ _for_ _their_ _good_ _work._ _We_ _want_ _all_ _of_ _Luther's_ _books_ _to_
_be_ _universally_ _prohibited_ _and_ _forbidden,_ _and_ _we_ _also_ _want_ _them_ _to_ _be_ _burned._

###### Luther dodged their efforts, and his legacy was the liberation of millions from a medieval mindset.

###### GALILEO GALILEI

In the early 1500s Nicolaus Copernicus (in today's Poland) demonstrated that contrary to the
‘settled science’ the Earth rotated around the sun (not vice-versa). Copernicus calculated
heliocentrism after decades of careful astronomical observations but was too frightened to
publish his findings while he lived. Posthumously Copernicus’ concept quietly spread amongst
free-thinking intellectuals across Europe. The church and their mates, the state sponsored
scientists, ridiculed and condemned the ideas of Copernicus.

Galileo Galilei was an Italian academic in the early to mid-1600s who had an irrepressible curiosity
for science. When Galileo heard about the invention of the telescope in Holland, he built his own.
Others were using telescopes to assist in hunting, sailing or other terrestrial pursuits. Galileo
looked up.

Soon after Galileo excitedly told the world that Jupiter had four orbiting moons ... so if that large
planet had orbiting bodies then the sun might too ... and so, Galileo thought, Copernicus might
have been be right. The scientific establishment was dismissive so Galileo asked some ‘experts’ to
look through his telescope ... but they claimed the telescope must be faulty because the science
was so settled.

In 1615, the church and the scientific establishment formally investigated Galileo’s claim and
found them ‘foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts
in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.’ Under threat of violence and incarceration, Galileo
was forced to stop talking about a heliocentric world. His writings on this subject were banned.

Galileo’s fortunes changed however seven years later in 1623 with the election of a more liberal
minded pope. This new pope encouraged Galileo to write a comprehensive book on the subject
###### of the Earth rotating around the sun. He was however given firm instructions to give a fair and
balanced account of both sides.

Galileo’s book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632. He was
however incapable of presenting fairy-tale science fairly and his book displeased the authorities.
Galileo was put on trial again. His prosecutor declared:

###### "Whereas you, Galileo of Florence, aged seventy years, were denounced in 1615, by this Holy Office, for holding as true a false doctrine taught by many, namely, that the sun is immovable. Also, for having pupils whom you instructed in the same opinions...."

_changing,_ _or_ _taking_ _from,_ _all_ _other_ _or_ _part_ _of_ _the_ _above-mentioned_ _pains_ _and_ _penalties."_

Galileo was condemned but given a light sentence because he did publicly (but
insincerely and unlike Socrates) renounce his views saying:

_Nevertheless,_ _wishing_ _to_ _remove_ _from_ _the_ _minds_ _of_ _your_ _Eminences_ _and_ _all_ _faithful_

###### that for the future I will neither say nor assert in speaking or writing such things as may bring upon me similar suspicion. I also swear and promise to adopt and observe entirely all the penances which have been or may be by this Holy Office imposed on me."

###### BERTRAND RUSSELL

Bertrand Russell was born into the liberal-minded wing of the British aristocracy in 1872. His
grandfather had twice been Prime Minister.

Russell was prominent in academic and public affairs until his death in 1970. He was acclaimed
across subjects as varied as mathematics, philosophy and literature.

World War One was a long, gruesome, pointless war that everyone lost and worst of all, it laid the
foundation for a bigger, badder world war.

In late June 1914, a Serbian fanatic assassinated the Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
It was almost certain there was going to be yet another war in the Balkans. With wiser leadership,
it would have been contained as such ... but in the following weeks one European great power
after another mobilised for war.

###### Britain’s entry into this abyss was far from certain. The nation was divided. The governing party
was the left-leaning Liberal Party. That party’s voters and members were firmly against war. The
cabinet was initially against but, as events unfolded across the channel, it bitterly split and on 4
August 1914 asked the King to declare war.

Bertrand Russell was Britain’s most outspoken anti-war campaigner. Maybe it would have been in
###### the best interests of all for the British to have declared, ‘We’re sitting this war out but we will strive to facilitate peace talks.’ That was what Russell was advocating and he should have been free to
make his case.

Russell was a Cambridge academic but was dismissed for publicising his anti-war stance. He then
spoke at a large public rally calling for an end to the war and was heavily fined. In 1918 he
campaigned against the United States entering the war and for that he was jailed for six months.
He was one of 6,000 British pacifists jailed.

Four years after the war, Russell was invited to give a keynote address on Free Thought and
Propaganda. He said:

###### "It is clear the most elementary condition, if thought is to be free, is the absence of
legal penalties for the expression of opinions...."

_discussion_ _with_ _people_ _who_ _have_ _the_ _opposite_ _bias,_ _and_ _cultivating_ _a_ _readiness_ _to_ _discard_
###### any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. What is wanted is not the will to believe, but
_the_ _wish_ _to_ _find_ _out,_ _which_ _is_ _its_ _exact_ _opposite._

_The_ _protection_ _of_ _minorities_ _is_ _vitally_ _important;_ _and_ _even_ _the_ _most_ _orthodox_ _of_ _us_ _may_ _find_

###### ROBERT MENZIES, BANNING THE COMMUNIST PARTY

When Karl Marx died in 1883 he was so obscure only a dozen attended his funeral. Thirty-four years
later, violent revolutionaries inspired by Marx seized power in Russia. Those Bolsheviks openly
declared Russia was the first stop      - they were hellbent on a world-wide Marxist revolution.

In 1949, Robert Menzies was elected Prime Minister of Australia. Marxists had by now taken over half
of Europe and China had fallen to communism only weeks before Menzies’ election. There were
fierce communist insurgencies across the world and in particular in east Asia. Wherever
###### communism went it was the same old story - privation/starvation, concentration camps and an all­
encompassing police state.

The Communist Party of Australia (CPA) was formed in 1920 and wanted to replicate all that

‘success’ here. We now know that pro-Moscow communists informants had infiltrated trade unions,
###### the Labor Party and even ASIO. There was always the fear that World War III would break out
between the Soviet Union and the United States and so concern about Australian communists was
more than understandable.

Throughout the 1940s, some campaigned in Australia for a law to ban the Communist Party.
Menzies’ coalition partner, the Country Party, campaigned on making communism illegal. Menzies
had opposed that drastic step but by 1949 Menzies changed course and supported banning of the
CPA.

Only five months after his election Prime Minister Menzies introduced the Communist Party
Dissolution Bill. Menzies told Parliament:

_"This_ _is_ _a_ _bill_ _to_ _outlaw_ _and_ _dissolve_ _the_ _Australian_ _Communist_ _party,_ _to_ _pursue_ _it_
###### into any new or associated forms, and to deal with the employment of Communists in certain offices and under certain circumstances. The bill is admittedly novel, and it is far-reaching. It is not an industrial law. It is not a law made under the conciliation and arbitration power. We are, therefore, not seeking by this bill to make any amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

_This_ _proposed_ _law_ _is,_ _in_ _a_ _most_ _special_ _and_ _important_ _sense,_ _a_ _law_ _relating_ _to_ _the_
###### safety and defence of Australia. It is designed to deal with, and, in certain cases, to give the Government power to deal with, the King's enemies in this country. If it touches certain Communists in their industrial office, as it certainly does, that is merely an inevitable consequence of a self-defending attack upon treason and fifth-columnism wherever they may be found...."

_...Let_ _me_ _say_ _at_ _the_ _outset_ _that_ _it_ _will_ _be_ _without_ _avail_ _for_ _any_ _honourable_
###### member to point out, as can be done quite readily, that for some years I and other persons resisted the idea of a Communist ban on the ground that, in time of peace, doubts ought to be resolved in favour of free speech. True, that was my view after the war, and it was the view of many others.

 But events have moved. We are not at peace to-day, except in a technical sense.
_The_ _Soviet_ _Union_ _-_ _and_ _I_ _say_ _this_ _with_ _profound_ _regret_ _-_ _has_ _made_ _perfect_ _the_
###### technique of the ‘cold-war’ - it has accompanied it by the organization of peace demonstrations - peace demonstrations, save the mark - designed, not to promote true peace, but to prevent or impair defence preparations in the democracies. We in this House and in this country, and people all over the British world, have witnessed the most threatening events in eastern Europe, in
_Germany,_ _in_ _East_ _Asia_ _and_ _in_ _South-East_ _Asia._ _If_ _we_ _have_ _learned_ _nothing_ _from_
###### all these things then, in the famous phrase, there is so health in us.

_The_ _real_ _and_ _active_ _Communists_ _in_ _Australia_ _present_ _us_ _with_ _our_ _immediate_
###### problem - not the woolly-headed dupes, not the people who are pushed to the front in order to present a respectable appearance, but the real and active Communists. We have a clear choice, and we must make it clearly. We can attack these Communists frontally, or we can adopt inaction and Justify it by accepting one or all of the arguments that are used currently to Justify inaction."

The Bill sought to close the CPA, liquidate their assets and ban a communist from working for
###### the public service or a union. Who was a communist? Under this Bill, government could declare
anyone a ‘communist’ and it was then up to them to prove their innocence. Members of the CPA
could be jailed for up to five years.

As the Bill was being debated communist North Korea invaded South Korea. Understandably,
Australia was worried about the march of communism.

Many Labor MPs and a few Liberal MPs had misgivings, but after a few amendments it passed
into legislation. The same day however, Labor’s Deputy Leader, Herbert V Evatt acting as the
lawyer for the CPA (and several pro-communist unions) took the matter to the High Court... and
###### the High Court found by a 6-1 majority that the legislation was unconstitutional, but not on free
speech grounds. The law was found unconstitutional simply because the High Court rightly
found that while the states could pass this law, the Commonwealth had no power to do so.

Menzies didn’t give up, so proposed a constitutional amendment which would have given him
###### the power to ban a political party. The ball was now in the court of the Australian people who
voted in a referendum known as the ‘1951 Australian Communist Party Ban Referendum.

It was not a question about whether the Australian people approved of communism            - at the
1949 federal election less than 1% voted for the CPA. This was a decision about whether Australia
was a free speech nation and 50.56% voted NO and so the CPA was not banned.

The CPA was dangerous, but the wise people of 1951 Australia knew it was better to deal with
###### communism by giving it free and fair exposure to public debate. CPA made no impact on
Australian elections. Had the CPA been banned they would have gone underground, become
more militant and potentially violent. Menzies was, on balance, a good Prime Minister but on
###### this occasion he was wrong and the Australian people were right. Communism was bad but
banning an idea only fuels it.

The only opinion that should entirely be banned is the opinion of every politician and bureaucrat
pushing this Bill. They should be sent to re-education camps and on release spend the rest of
###### their lives on a watchlist.

Yours sincerely,

The Hon John Ruddick MLC

Member of the NSW Legislative Council
