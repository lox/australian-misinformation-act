# Freedom of Speech

I am wrifing in regard to the proposed legislafion to remove freedom of speech from the
Australian people. Freedom of speech is an essenfial element of a democrafic society.

I understand that freedom of speech must have some restricfions on the like of “hate
speech”, etc, however so-called misinformafion and disinformafion does not fall into this
category. Debate on a variety of issues concerning the public is essenfial.

One of my concerns is who is going to decide what is mis/disinformafion. This will likely be a
mafter of personnel beliefs or from government direcfives and have nothing to do with the
facts or truth. Much like the present day “fact checkers”.

I believe, if this undemocrafic legislafion is passed, it will be abused by the government and
its agencies. As we know most of the mis/disinformafion over the last few years has come
from the government, its agencies and the main stream media.
