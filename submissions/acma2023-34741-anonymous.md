As an Australian citizen, I write to express the strongest possible objection to the
proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

# If enacted, it would suppress, even usurp, intelligent, informed debate and
critical-thinking analysis on any and every topic that the government deemed
should be locked out of the arena for free expression and free exchange of ideas,
opinions, hypotheses and research results.

More seriously, it could stifle any attempt to speak out against governmental
and institutional corruption, or hold those in power accountable.

Besides which, what person/s or body would have the power to declare what
constituted misinformation or disinformation? This is not made clear, just as the
terms themselves are not made clear. And what chance would there be for any
independent, highly credentialed person or body to prove to the public that what
the government had decreed to be mis/disinformation was, in fact, completely
accurate?
This bill is a blatant attempt to suppress and control social media in order to
suppress and control genuine participation by Australians in the processes of government through
the free exchange of ideas.

Even the submission process is an exercise in suppression, as it does not allow
anywhere near ample time for the bill to be fully considered and debated by the
best independent minds and institutions in the country.
In addition, it is outrageous, even egregious, that the government,
the mainstream media and specific protected organisations would be
exempt from being accused of or taken to task for disseminationg misinformation or
disinformation themselves. It would, in effect, allow all of those bodies to twist
or sideline the facts and the truth, and even to tell outright LIES if they so chose!
Regarding hate speech, does not Australia have perfectly good laws covering this
area already? Likewise, real incitement to violence? I would have grave concerns
that this bill, if passed, would allow the government to conflate free speech and
legitimate protest with hate and violence, as already happened during the
pandemic period. No one could publicly go against 'The Science' then (and now still) without being
ridiculed, vilified or shadow-banned, and at least one political figure was declaring
'anti-vaxxers' to be domestic terrorists. Hate speech in itself.

Glaring examples of government and media misinformation and disinformation with utterly horrific
consequences were ‘The Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction’ LIE for which over 1 million Iraqis
died and due to the criminal use of ‘depleted uranium’ generation after generation of Iraqis have
high birth defects. ADDITIONALLY the so called Covid Vaccine was coerced onto the Australian
public by both Government and the mainstream media as SAFE and EFFECTIVE, however in a
European Covid Inquiry a Pfizer executive, Janine Small, testified that the Covid Vaccine had not
been tested for stopping transmission. That the Covid injections were/are NOT safe has emerged
from reliable data showing that excess death rates have exploded across the world during and
following the massive uptake of Covid vaccines, a possibility that most politicians and mainstream
media studiously ignore (along with serious vaccine injuries) and that would almost certainly attract
a mis or dis label if this bill was enacted.

Meanwhile, over in the USA, sanity has prevailed in an American Supreme Court
judge's decision to ban, or at least limit, the ability of Biden administration
officials to use social media sites to censor information that isn't favourable to
them.
I call on you to follow that eminently wise, morally correct and politically
enlightened decision and abort the draft bill before it even gets to Parliament.
It is (a) totally redundant, (b) the abject antithesis of democracy, (c) in direct
contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (to which
Australia is a signatory), as well as Article 19 of the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and (d) clearly a deliberate and intentional pathway
to totalitarianism.
