To Whom It May Concern

I am writing to "Have My Say" regarding the draft Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I am extremely concerned that

there will be any increase in government power to combat mis/dis information, as the government
describes it. I believe in human rights and the right to freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is
fundamental to a democracy. Without freedom of speech THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY. I absolutely
disagree with the concept that the government of the day can decide what is misinformation or
disinformation - and then impose heavy fines on individuals or businesses that challenge the dictates
of the government of the day. For me this is Orwellian and frightening. We must be allowed to have
freedom of speech and free social media. It is NOT the role of the government to decide what is
'science' and then to punish anyone with a different view. Science involves discussion and debate.

There have been numerous incidences of purported 'misinformation/ disinformation' since 2020
that I have been aware of. For example, It was incorrectly called misinformation/ disinformation to
say that the Pfizer 'covid vaccine' did not stop transmission or infection of COVID 19. Individuals and
doctors were deplatformed from social media for saying this. Pfizer employees and the Pfizer data/
reports have however since confirmed that is is ACTUALLY true. This is one of many extremely
important pieces of information that was suppressed worldwide by governments and social media.

I absolutely believe that it IS NOT the role of governments in a democracy to have the power to issue
financial or other penalties to individuals or businesses for 'not telling the truth'.

In the past 3 years evidence and facts have been suppressed to allow a government sponsored
TRUTH to prevail. The level of trust that many many Australians have towards the Australian
government and our institutions have been eroded in the past few years. The kind of
communications legislation proposed will further erode trust in our democracy. This is an attempt at
a type of totalitarian control. Governments are heavily influenced by lobbyists and donors. This too
is of great concern and of course will influence what is regarded as 'truth'.

As a concerned citizen who worries for the freedom and democracy of our future, I implore the
Australian government to cease this Communications Legislation Amendment(combatting
misinformation and disinformation).

My idea of health and wellbeing - and bodily autonomy - should not be dictated to me by the
Australian government. It has been proven untrue that those who were cautious about allowing an
inadequately tested pharmaceutical product have damaged the health of the wider population. The
damage done to many Australians and their businesses and the Australian economy because of
lockdowns has been

It is no longer 'misinformation' to challenge the effectiveness of lockdowns.This draft legislation
mentions controlling mis/disinformation to protect the health and wellbeing of Australians. Taking
away our freedom of speech with threats of heavy fines and penalties WILL NOT improve the health
and wellbeing of Australians.

I fear that the country I love, Australia, which I have regarded as the best place to live and raise a
family, is trying to become more like China which socially controls its population. The draft
Communications Legislations proposed will have a huge impact on Australian culture and freedoms
that we have previously enjoyed and have taken for granted. In Australia we acknowledge the huge
sacrifices our soldiers have made fighting fascism (WW2) and the threat of

Communism (Vietnam war - in which young Australian men were conscripted to fight). This draft
legislation will erode our right to free speech and will damage the health and well-being of
Australians. Individuals have the intelligence and ability to decide what they believe to be true.
Governments are constantly changing and are filled with unelected bureaucrats. Government should
not have the power to decide what is 'true'.

I implore that the government does not allow this amendment and does not impose fines for
mis/disinformation.

Sincerely
