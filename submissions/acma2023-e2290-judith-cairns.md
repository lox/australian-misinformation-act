# I totally oppose any law which would allow ACMA or any other Australian body to restrict in any way the Australian peoples freedom of speech.

 This applies to any issue whatsoever. It is not up to the government to decide what is acceptable and what is not. This is a definite overreach of government power and must not be implemented.

 I do not consent to this Act.
