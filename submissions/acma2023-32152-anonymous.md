Is this the new version of Ministry of Truth?

Who's to say what is misinformation? The government? If they don't like someone's views they'll say
is misinformation and shut it down, like the communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe

No, we dont need this. Free speech is free, let people decide what's good and what's bad. Instead of
suppressing information why don't you teach people to think? But usually the gov wants obedient
people and thinking humans are not obedient
