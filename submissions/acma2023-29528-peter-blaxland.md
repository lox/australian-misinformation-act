The draft Communication Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023 is a dramatic step too far. When seen in the context of other government policies it is
evident Australia is experiencing an acceleration towards greater government control over more and
more of our lives;

      - The Voice - influenced by the likes of Thomas Mayo and Teela Reid, advocates of
‘punishment, redistribution of power and money’.

      - Massive immigration into a stressed, slowing and energy challenged economy with a
housing crisis – a national Ponzi scheme leading to lower standard of living for almost all.

      - March towards digital identity and currency - prerequisites of a social credit system.

The above, are only some of the policies that are harmful to our way of life, but this bill is a jarring
awakening to the existential threat to democracy, free speech and truth. This is an attack against
thinking Australians and more in line with what we would expect after a communist takeover.

Robodebt and Covid-19 mandates are powerful examples of how profoundly wrong and destructive
government policies can be; much or most of what was suppressed across all media has proven to be
true. History, logic and common sense should have led us to legislate against authoritarianism, not
more of it.

The intention of the government to appoint itself as the sole arbiter of ‘truth’ with bendable
discretionary definitions of misinformation and disinformation, is a chilling revelation of its true
character – displaying a sinister ‘whatever-it-takes’ attitude to maximising long-term power and
control through subjugation of truth and free speech.

The real alarm however, only arises when one takes a global perspective to see where this is heading;
not merely designed to supress dissent on current policies and legislation but to ‘manage’ our
response to even more extreme-left, socialist and even Marxist policies that are coming at us from
the WEF, WHO and UN.

Pandemics, climate/energy and gender/sexuality are the primary issues to be used to justify punitive
censorship, financial cancellation and if Queensland is any indication, possibly even imprisonment.
By enshrining in law, the power to arbitrarily censor facts and opinions on these and other issues, we
tear apart a foundational right that has powerfully contributed to our nations success and attracted
migrants seeking prosperity and freedom. The latter is a right that we are so proud of that we ensure
migrants fully understand that it includes free speech, before granting them citizenship.

Migrants that we gave refuge to as they fled authoritarian regimes, have been amongst the first to
recognise the early signs of authoritarianism appearing here. This is NOT what anyone migrated for,
is NOT what our armed forces went to war for, or what voters called for. The deception of this draft
bill and others, is that it has nothing to do with our protection, wellbeing, and prosperity, but is all
about transforming this nation into the image prescribed by the afore mentioned globalist entities.
Nothing more than a betrayal.
