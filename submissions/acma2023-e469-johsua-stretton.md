I could never agree to a misinformation and disinformation bill. No living person or body of people
know truth and can accurately represent truth to then enforce this bill. This will damage people and
provide power to people that think they are correct even when they may be wrong. In fact this
rejects the ability for further peer review after ‘false truths’ are accepted.

I suggest dismissing this bill, otherwise the truth that smoking is good for us and asbestos is a
miracle product (historical events) may be ‘good’ scenarios. This bill doesn’t allow for the acceptance
of reviewing information after initial acceptance of 'false truths' Opposing false truths would get
massive fines or gaol. We will really have to be willing to throw away our lives to stand up for the
truth.

Please dismiss this bill.
