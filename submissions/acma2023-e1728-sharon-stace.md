**SUBJECT: Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation**

**and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

To Whom It May Concern,

I would like this letter/email to be considered as a submission. This submission can be made public.

I am writing to you to express my concern about ‘Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’. I am
against it for many reasons but will condense it the following few.

 - This Bill is a significant over-reach by the Government exceeding any other existing models in the
western world. The fact that it is a blatantly opposing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
should be concern enough. But this Bill has the potential to remove from the Australian people
everything that the Declaration of Human Rights is trying to protect. Equivalent European laws are not
this ambiguous or restrictive and are working models.

 - The Government in its intent to combat online misinformation and disinformation by foreign
instigators, Australian ones or any illegal or dangerous organisation could be used to legitimise
attempts to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce politically motivated
ideological conformity. This tyrannical type of over-reach is not ‘pie in the sky’ as it was evident in the
way Federal and State Governments handled the recent pandemic with their allies the media. Two
critical manipulators of misinformation.

 - The exemption of the main players of misinformation, two being the Government and media, to be
exempt from censorship is ridiculous. The Bill enables them and their bureaucrat buddies, big tech to
censor speech without any clear boundaries, guidelines or standards. It lacks accountability or
transparency on those who hold the power of control over it. As it stands it can clearly become
weaponised against the very people it is supposed to protect.

 - This Bill is vague in its definition of ‘harm’. And yet wants to give excessive penalties and prosecutions.
It wants to transfer its responsibility risks onto the Providers and Platforms when it is not theirs to
police free speech. Free Speech is just that. Twitter was compromised by the USA Government and
this model is to give our Government more power than displayed in the US. I cannot think of anything
worse. A global assault on free speech and any opposing view was obvious during the Pandemic and
that was without Bills like this. Weaponization is a very real possibility and all things considered there
are Centuries of evidence where things that were meant for good in the hands of evil become weapons
of destruction.


-----

 - Who deems what is responsible and irresponsible speech. Who or what decides what subjects are
worth talking about. This is a power that should remain with the individual. Good leadership in
Government should be debating controversial subjects and showing the Australian public how it can be
done rather than looking for ways to remove the opposing narrative.

 - This Bill contradicts the Governments ideology particularly that of giving voice to the minorities.
Censorship of this magnitude has the potential to remove voice from minority opposing opinions.

I say ‘NO’ to this unprecedented, under prepared Bill. It is like ‘Pandoras Box’ or a ‘Can of Worms’. This bill
although presented to do good is going to do more harm.  It is tokenistic at its best. Like the ‘VOICE’ it is a
Trojan Horse. Please consider how dangerous this Bill is and stop it in its tracks.

Yours sincerely

Sharon Stace
