It is my and every other citizen of Australia’s basic, fundamental, in-alienable human right to
discriminate and to associate with or not associate with, to do business with or not do business with
other people of our individual choice.

'hat is my right.

The^^^^tron^^rt^o^^estrict religious freedom. Legalise abortion to birth.

HIMiBwiMWHwHBMwMWHBMMi Deny freedom of speech and expression through cancel culture.

H. Usurp and overturn parental rights.

Marginalise and silence Christians and other faiths beliefs. AND Even criminalise prayer!

Each religion has the right to practice its values and to discriminate and exclude those who do not
share or accept their beliefs.
Those who do not are free to start their own religion or sports team or association.

What is hate speech?
It is estimated that 15 million people around the world have died from Covid 19
and inestimable damage has been done to the economies of every country.

It is estimated that HIV-AIDS has killed 40 million people around the world and

UNAIDS 2023 estimates. As of 2022, roughly 13.9 million [10.6-18.4 million] children
under the age of 18 had lost one or both parents to AIDS-related causes.

Is that “Hate Speech”?

The foundational principle of Democracy is majority rule not rule by 2% of the
### population.

 Pedaling, transmitting on television, radio or social media of false claims regarding vaccines and the well proven benefits thereof and medical quackery should be blocked and prosecuted as should greenwashing of climate and environmental comments that are false and misleading.

I am happy for my submission to appear on your website excluding my address,
### phone number and email address

 Thankyou for affording me the opportunity to make a submission.

Yours Sincerely,

Ivan Quail
