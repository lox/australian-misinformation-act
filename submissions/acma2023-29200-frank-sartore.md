I do not believe the government or a body set up by them has the ability or even the intention of
deciding what is genuinly true or not. To give a department the power to decide what is truth and to
censor what they don't like is a threat to democracy. There is ample evidence of governments and
departments getting an issue completely wrong and they have a very poor record of correction. This
is inviting the "ministry of truth" to make a judgement which they are not equiped to do, and so
should not be done. Restricting free speech does not promote truth.
