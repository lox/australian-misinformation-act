I am a local to the beautiful region of . I am a proud parent to three teenagers
and a teacher of young children in a local primary school. Whilst I and my family are largely
private in the conduct of our lives, we appreciate having a voice and freedom of speech and
democracy in Australia.

I strongly reject this proposed legislation. It has serious and detrimental implications for free
speech in Australia. The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”.
But the government will cause harm by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible
for protecting the rights of the individual, not suppressing them.

This bill is a direct challenge to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – that everyone has
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers.

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” should cause
grave concerns about this bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that staying
indoors and minimising contact with other humans outside of their family was imperative.
Victorians were 'locked up' for weeks on end because we were told it would keep us safe from
the virus. Yes, we largely avoided the virus in 2020 but most Victorians have since had it with
little to no ill-impact. However, the toll from this misinformation to Victorians is being felt in the
rising mental health statistics and in the apparent lack of social skills and resilience in our
children and young people. The 'lockdowns' did more harm than good, yet those who
questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media. It has became obvious to
everyone the government was wrong in locking Australians up, and the “misinformation” was
right!

This one example shows why giving the government even more power is a recipe for disaster.

This bill must be thrown out.
