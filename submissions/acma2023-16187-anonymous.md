**Submission Against the Proposed New ACMA powers                          to combat**

**misinformation and disinformation**

**I object totally to this Proposed Legislation, it is an attack on Democracy, Freedom of Speech,**
and Freedom of Expression, it is an attempt to silence anyone that has a different point of view or
goes against mainstream media or government who have the audacity to excluded themselves from
this Legislation,
Politicians are the biggest culprits of Misinformation and Disinformation just look at the Ukraine
War and all the Lies that have been fed to us, Government and mainstream media said it was Russia
that blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline, yet it is now proven it was Not Russia.
Seymour Hearsh and other independent media who exposed the Truth would have been silenced by
this legislation.

Other independent Journalists said America was supping Depleted Uranium weapons, their reports
were taken down as disinformation, yet it was true, and when mainstream media covered it a month
later and lied when they said this was a breaking story, it was not taken down.

So what may be taken down as misinformation and disinformation now, could be found to be not
misinformation and disinformation in the future.

This Legislation gives power to a few people who may be Corrupt, could be Bribed, Influenced or
have their own agenda and want to silence anyone that opposed them.

Australia is supposed to be a democratic and free Country, if you don't like it, Leave and go live in a
country that has no freedom.

There are too many laws already such as defamation Laws, we do not need any more laws,
especially ones like this!

Freedom of Speech is being stifled or stopped already, all you have to do is look at news and other
platforms and their comments sections, they are already censored or stopped, the worst culprits
being the ABC, SBS and others such as YAHOO and MICROSOFT, so it is already Happening.

As far as penalties, there should be none for simply saying what you believe.

This legislation is legislation you would expect from the Draconian Liberal Government and its
really alarming that its even being considered by Labor!

Then there is the issue of Costs, how about spending the millions on Public health, housing and
energy instead of wasting it on this Legislation.

**This Legislation is very Dangerous and must be STOPPED.**
