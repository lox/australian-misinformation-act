Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)_

**Democracy ends when censorship controls free discussion!**

**The Covid Debacle is a prime example of censorship. The following questions need answering.**

Why did fact checkers censor alternative opinions during covid? What qualifications did they have?

Who decides what is misinformation? Vested interests maybe? Who funded the ‘Fact Checkers’ and
gave them instructions on what to censor?

Why do these fact checkers remain nameless and unaccountable while their targets are named and
publicly demonised?

What right do any so called ‘fact checkers’ have to ‘fact check’ and block highly distinguished
experts speak on their field of expertise?

Why did Government experts refuse to supply scientific references they based their ‘science’ and
‘laws’ on? Could it be it was all propaganda to control the masses?

**During Covid distinguished experts with lifelong experience in their field were ‘gaslit’ and de-**
**platformed by anonymous ‘fact checkers’. Scientific research papers that did not fully reflect**
**the ‘Establishment’ view were not published.**

Emerging evidence shows the censored experts were correct about: surgical masks being ineffective
against viruses, the vaccine’s safety, the vaccine’s protectiveness, the vaccine spike protein
spreading throught the body including the brain, the vaccine preventing virus transmission, natural
immunity more effective and longer lasting, the effect of lockdowns on mental health and economic
outcomes, non-transmission of the virus outdoors, effectiveness of sunshine and outdoor exercise on
immunity, importance of effective early treatments, PCR tests incapable of diagnosing an infection.

Small businesses went broke through lockdowns while large companies made massive profits
through censorship of the truth. Debate was not allowed. Cruely, little children were forced to wear
ineffective masks – much to our shame.

Many censored experts were long experienced medics and natural health promoters who freely gave
natural heath information on line. Many had their online sites and material destroyed without
warning by internet providers.

The most alarming TGA Vaccine ‘Nonclinical Evaluation Report’ was withheld from the public –
why? Why were the PCR test cycles kept from the public? Could it be to increase false positives
and fear?

**Providing the truth and allowing open debate could have saved many from illness believing**
**that vaccination would protect them and their family, that masks prevented viral spread, that**
**lockdowns saved lives etc.**

Today information about the 10% to 15% excess deaths commencing in 2021 and continuing is
most concerning but concealed. Still there is still no discussion about why so many healthy young
people are dying suddenly. Why many others are now unable to work.

Covid fear was broadcast continuously. Fear pervaded the community. Vital information was denied
to us e.g. We were not told the average age of Covid deaths was above eighty years of age.
Approximately the same as a normal life expectancy. That most children already had natural
antibodies and didn’t need an experimental vaccination.

People lost jobs, careers, homes and businesses based on unscientific laws and rules!

We were denied simple information on how to upgrade our immune systems to protect against the
virus while minimising serious heath risks if infected.

Government hate speech was directed at those who refused the experimental vaccine. The
unvaccinated were locked down and persecuted.

**Our Governments and health authorities constantly lied to us through Covid. ‘Science’ was**
made up on the run- without any scientific evidence. Politicians and Government medical personel
told us they the science was settled and they were the holders of all truth. We were lied to and
treated as children.

Alternative health information was denied to Australians by Government and private operators. One
must ask why did they deceive us? And more importantly, who gained from this censorship?

The censoring of scientific studies and alternative views during Covid is a crime committed against
all thinking Australians.

Those complicit in denying our democratic right to information over Covid must be held to account.

**The Government COVID propaganda response is the best example of why censorship should**
**never be permitted.**

**Otherwise the propaganda of the powerful will prevail, and the democracy our forefathers**
**fought for will be no more.**

Yours Sincerely

Malcolm Pendergast
