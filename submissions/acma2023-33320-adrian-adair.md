# Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications
and the Arts:

This amendment is a very very bad idea!

Without free speech what is still left of our democracy is doomed. Who critiques ‘power’ if
the citizenry is too afraid to and ‘power’ itself decides what is misinformation,
disinformation and the truth for all? Individuals, without interference from the state, are
best placed to decide this for themselves.

A proper functioning democracy requires politicians who truly care about their nation, who
have integrity and who sincerely and earnestly are accountable to, and want to serve, the
people. In support it requires a bureaucracy and public funded entities that are impartial
and apolitical. Unfortunately Australia’s public scene possesses little of these attributes.

Presently we are over governed and over controlled, and tax payers’ money is being spent
with little restraint.

In addition and unfortunately, it is very apparent that the most powerful urge a bureaucratic
entity possesses is the ability to justify its continued existence and expansion. What
Australia needs to combat the unchecked growth that this reality creates, is an effective
mechanism to control, review, reduce and decommission bureaucracies, NGOs and taxpayer funded activist groups.

To further entrench and justify their existence and importance, politicians and the
bureaucracy have sought to promote and reward victimhood rather than personal
independence and responsibility, self-reliance and resilience. As a result we now have an
ever increasing percentage of the population enslaved as victims and dependent upon
government handouts. This is sad, it traps rather than empowers individuals.

Democracy and a healthy nation cannot be restored and prevail if the state controls the
critique in any way what-so-ever? The situation is bad enough already with the Prime
Minister and his Government pushing ahead relentlessly with their ALP National
Conference agenda and the ACTU agenda without any concern for democratic process or
impact. It is obvious that the current Government does not answer to the people.

Unfortunately, many entities that should be independent of political bias have been
compromised. These include federal and state bureaucracies, police forces, public
education institutions, lawyers, magistrates and tribunals, media, especially the ABC, and
non-government organisations (NGO). Some NGO are publicly funded activist groups
which are intent on destroying democracy.

In terms of government sponsored misinformation, disinformation, omissions and untruths,
the way in which the PM and his Government are prosecuting the ‘Voice’, is a clear
indication that they cannot be trusted. Unbelievably, standard conventions for conducting
referenda are being willingly and completely violated. The blatant disrespect for
convention, communicating honestly and openly, and accountability, is palpable.


-----

This is our present circumstance, but in any case, no PM or government or bureaucracy
should be entrusted with determining what is misinformation, disinformation and the truth.

State premiers, like-wise have been riding rough-shod over their electorates, avoiding
accountability and generally disrespecting democratic principle and process.

It is essential that free speech be restored, protected and encouraged and the populace be
educated to think critically. Propaganda and dogma must be removed from our education
system, politics, media, etc; it is lazy and evil!

This draft amendment, if accepted will erode further, the present bad situation and
accelerate Australia’s departure from essential democratic processes that value
individualism, into one captured by collectivism and state control. Tragically we are well
down that road, and it seems that some in power and academia are more than attracted to
romantic notions of more state control.

l MOST STRONGLY OBJECT to the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The very fact that this draft bill is being put forward, is in itself earnestly worrisome. Is it
through extreme naivety, or are there serious malevolent intentions lurking below the
surface? The very existence of this draft is good reason for the populous at large to have
grave doubts about the competence of the government, the Department of Infrastructure,
Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, and the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).

The proposed bill will exacerbate a dangerous trend by undermining further the right to
freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that fundamental right with the notion of
combating so-called ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’. Fundamental rights such as free
expression cannot be balanced against anything. This Bill, without any doubt, will further
erode and undermine Australian citizens’ fundamental right to express themselves.

Australia’s ill-considered suite of anti-discrimination and discrimination laws, has seriously
eroded and deterred Australian’s willingness to express themselves. They have overturned the sacrosanct principle of law that one is ‘innocent until proven guilty’. We should
be encouraging robust discussion on the basis of ‘sticks and stones will break my bones
and names will never hurt me’ not encouraging people to choose to be offended and seek
protection as victims. Through this ill-conceived platform of law, regulation and
accompanying enforcement bureaucracy, Australia is violating it’s solemn commitment to
the UNHRC (Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Accepting this draft bill will further
deepen Australia’s international hypocrisy and further deny Australian’s their basic right to
freedom of speech. Opportunity for abuse and government over-reach and intrusion into
people’s private lives, will be further increased.

Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ is and will
always remain subjective, and entrusting a government agency to decide what is truth
raises very very serious concerns. Additionally there is ever the threat that politicians will
bring pressure to bear to influence any agency entrusted with this heavy responsibility.

So-called ‘misinformation’ does not cause direct harm, and defining harm based on
subjective criteria is problematic.


-----

The bill seeks to grant excessive control to authorities and will lead to censorship.
Rather than pursuing bills that control and restrict, we should be teaching and encouraging
all Australian’s to engage in robust, thoughtful, objective and respectful discussion. If the
present unhealthy condition of public discourse is not corrected, our good fortune of living
in one of the best countries in the world will evaporate.

Another important initiative that the Government ought to be committed to is ensuring the
social media entities refrain from ‘canceling’ contributors and censoring discussion.
Politicians that call for anybody to be censored must be disciplined; to do so is to
disrespect an individuals right to free speech.

Free speech is a near absolute right, and laws should not be made that do anything other
than protect and encourage citizens to engage in respectful dialogue; to express
themselves. Democracy is based squarely upon this right, closely coupled with the rule of
(and general respect) for law, without this Australia will slip into a truly tragic state, a
totalitarian state.

Further, danger lies in the bill's vague definitions of "misinformation" and "disinformation",
which are open to interpretation and abuse by those in power. And then there is the
question of who decides what is ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’. Instances where
official fact-checkers have gotten it wrong or labeled satire and humour as misinformation
are not uncommon. And entrusting a government agency to be the arbiter of truth, is eerily
reminiscent of the dystopian "Ministry of Truth" from George Orwell's 1984.

For every passing moment that the present unhealthy condition of public discourse is
allowed to prevail, national health and prosperity will continue to decline and we will lose
what little we have left of the founding principals upon which our successful democracy
rests. More draconian restrictions will follow and we will all become victims of those who
are plotting to control us. For some time now politicians of particular persuasions across
Australian governments have arrogantly refused to answer questions, and to be
accountable to the electorate. And rather than substantive arguments all we get are
marketing slogans and regurgitation of propaganda and narrative. A paradigm shift is
urgently needed now, not to shut the populous up, but to open the closed ears of the selfserving politicians that are visiting upon Australian’s, pain and destruction.

Truth, justice and the wellbeing of our society is safe-guarded best when the ‘state’ and its
mechanisms protect, respect and respond sincerely to the sacred right of every citizen to
speak out.

It is not the states place to control public dialogue, rather it is it’s place to listen.

This amendment is a very very bad idea!
