How would you, the reader, appreciate me deciding what is and is not misinformation. Me, some stranger, give me the
power to control your sense of truth. Give me the power to come round and write little sticky notes on your things,
burn the books I think are trash and put liittle notes on the titles in your available netflix catalogue. Or just remove the
items that dont benefit me to be seen or agree with my political beliefs.

Tell me with a straight face that hypothetical is a good idea, and I'll agree that unelected govt bodies should decide
what myself (or anyone for that matter) is allowed to perceive as true.

Yours in good faith,

p.s Also let me read all your DM's I forgot that private messaging section earlier.
