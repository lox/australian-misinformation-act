ACMA misinformation Bill

Censorship of information or communications determined to be Misinformation or Disinformation is
a dangerous precedent only used in dictatorships or tyrannical regimes as evidenced by history and
in the current era in countries like China under CCP rule. Governments typically and historically
censor free speech to stifle debate or censor information they find embarrassing or that which could
expose corruption or that which does not fit the narrative governments are promulgating.

This Bill will allow the government and mainstream media to lie to the Australian people and then
cover up the lie by censoring anybody questioning or revealing the actual truth. It will also allow the
government to censor people it doesn’t like or censor any information it wants censored. I cite the
overreach of government during Covid censoring individuals on social media posting anything the
government didn’t like being stated about Covid Vaccines, specifically that obtuse and meaningless
term “vaccine hesitancy” before any misinformation/disinformation Bill was even considered and so
what malfeasance can we expect if this bill passes. Also the government malfeasance under Covid
also censored members of Parliament such as Craig Kelly who was censored and de-platformed from
Facebook, his only major platform by which to reach his electorate and other Australian voters and
now we find after 3 years of the Covid restrictions that are still evident in certain businesses that
everything he posted was accurate and correct. God forbid if we allow the government to legislate
themselves as the sole arbiters of truth and to censor anything they deem as untruthful. I see that as
an Orwellian dystopia and both George Orwell’s novels Animal Farm and 1984 I read in the early
years of high school and those novels left an indelible mark on my conscience and I’m fully aware of
the malfeasance that governments can subject their citizens to and that was clearly evident over the
last 3 years where the government pandemic procedures could not be debated no matter how
ridiculous some of the restrictions were, such as wearing surgical masks outside in the fresh air and
knowing full well these masks are not designed to stop viral transmission and cannot filter 150nm
aerosolised viruses. This was utter stupidity and because of this government cannot be trusted with
the truth.

Because of the atrocious and tyrannical Covid management over 3 years and the censorship of
Australian citizens on social media and through mainstream media, a bill giving government or its
regulator ACMA the role of sole arbiter of truth is anathema to a free society.

As educated Australians we do not need a government to tell us or protect us from, what they deem
as misinformation as we are capable of discerning that for ourselves and want to receive
information from all sources irrespective of government because governments lie and aren’t
transparent and cannot be trusted with the truth always even though we expect the government to
tell us the truth always that doesn’t happen.

The untrustworthy nature of government has accelerated in the last 3 years during the Covid
pandemic where Australians have been lied to on many occasions.

On an international stage I can recount the coalition of the willing and the invasion of Iraq for
weapons of mass destruction. That invasion was based on a lie by the Australian, UK and American
governments and can never be excused on faulty intelligence as that is fallacious otherwise we have
absolutely no faith in the intelligence agencies because of incompetence or they are untrustworthy
and misinforming and lying to us.

In summary if this Bill is passed it will be the death knell for Free Speech in this country and a
pathway to dictatorial tyranny and loss of freedom in Australia as there is no free in freedom
without free speech.

So I reject the Bill outright.
