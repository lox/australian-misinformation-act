I understand the urge to control information in this day and age when everything true and false can be found online. Information is
available everywhere at any time.

However, I do not agree with this amendment to the Communications Legislation. I believe this is a huge infringement on freedom
of speech. It is wrong. Many communist and tyrant nations such as North Korea, China, Russia, Cuba and Arabic countries
control the information that their population reads. Australia should not be added to that list.

Everyone has the right to voice their opinions. Otherwise we will be living in a false world where only the opinion of certain
controlling people matter. And who is to say if an information is right or wrong. There are plenty of scientific records of studies
with contradictory results. All studies are important. We should have access to all of this information. And people should be able
to use the information to make their own opinions. The amendment suggests that information is one sided and it never is!

Thinking back to the days of discoveries, Einstein, Galileo, Freud..how would they have discovered things and questioned
previously scientifical accepted research if information wasn't available. How would we love.with electricity, airplanes and
internet if research has been hidden away?

The impact this law would have on the nation is enormous. It would damage people's critical thinking, problem solving, creativity
and so much more. People would essentially become dumb and naive. I do not believe this is the goal of Australia as a
progressive nation. Or
...is it?

Please don't pass this Bill,
Thanks for listening (reading ï¿½)
