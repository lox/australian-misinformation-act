My name is . I'm a public servant, a father, husband and stepfather.

I regard freedom of speech as a cornerstone of our society, whether or not I agree with what's being said. Many things
denounced as misinformation or disinformation during the COVID pandemic have since been proven to be true, and this is just
one example of many hundreds that could be itemized.

This proposed bill to combat so-called “misinformation and disinformation” must be wholly rejected.
I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a violation of
Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how unelected
bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

Please reject this bill.
