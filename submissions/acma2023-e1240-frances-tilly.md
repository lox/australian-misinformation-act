Please Mr Albanese withdraw the current proposed “Misinformation and Disinformation Bill”, because, for one
thing, if passed and implemented it would be breaking
Article 19 of
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS .
This Article 19, covers the fundamental Freedom of Speech and Communication and this includes the digital
platform so much in use and readily available today, namely,
Facebook and Instagram, Google and Netflix.

If the said “Bill” was passed it would empower the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA) to
compel online Service Providers to censor online speech which it considers “harmful “.
ACMA would also have the power to impose significant penalties on these online Service Providers.
This policing is paramount to authoritarian control . I have even heard it referred to as
“Big Brother on Steroids” .
The term “ harmful “ is a thinly veiled ideological definition ...”harmful” to which cause ?

I support the good work being done by the Australian Christian Lobby, by submitting this submission .
I appeal for wisdom in our Government Leaders who are considering this “Bill”.
It is a sham to suggest it is protecting Australians, rather it is a threat to our valued Democracy and the rights of
FREE SPEECH.

OUR AUSTRALIAN WAY of being able to Speak -up should never be tampered with .

I am a very honest and concerned citizen and value my right to voice my opinion .
Long may this remain so .

Frances Tilly.
