# To Australian Federal MPs, 


# A case against the new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

The Fourth Estate is a term that refers to news media and the phrase holds its origins in the
French Revolu9on where the Church, Nobility and Commoners comprised the first, second
and third estates. The term was coined by Edmund Burke in 1821 who wanted to point out
the power of the press.

The press is supposed to act as a watch dog to hold elected officials and public figures to
account but that is seriously inhibited in my opinion when you allow the Federal
Government to intervene.

There are provisions in the bill that excludes sa9re what makes this problema9c is sa9re can
be very subjec9ve and could poten9ally mean that people could be charged with
misinforma9on over a meme on the internet. For example, the Instagram account Babylon
Bee creates sa9rical news ar9cles which can easily be misinterpreted as misinforma9on.

Misinforma9on is defined as content containing informa9on that is false, misleading or
decep9ve and is likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

Harm has a very broad defini9on from hatred a group in society on the basis of sexual
orienta9on, race, gender, ethnicity to disrup9on of public order, harm to the health of
Australians, harm to the environment and so forth. The main issue with this defini9on is the
subjec9ve nature of it. One such example involves Comedian Isaac BuOerfield who was
inves9gated by the Queensland Human Rights Commission over a joke, one may interpret a
joke as sa9re another may call it hate speech. By harm to the environment could this mean
online debate surrounding climate change could be called climate denialism? Could a post
containing a credible report of a vaccine adverse advent be called vaccine misinforma9on
and harm to the health of Australians? Could this mean the promo9on of a peaceful protest
could be deemed as a disrup9on to public order?

Under the defini9on News Source that is defined as newspaper, magazine, television
program, radio, a website or a program of audio or visual content to be distributed over the
internet. My concern is that this creates a lot of grey areas in that on a podcast a host may
discuss topics with guests and express their opinions which in the pandemic era caused a lot
of content to be flagged for misinforma9on. Which means that some podcasts on plaWorms
may not be viewable in Australia, or Australians podcasters and independent journalists with
their own websites will see massive fines if their news contradicts the government.

In Schedule two subsec9on 5H it states that a penalty of 5% of the annual turnover be paid
if a corpora9on exceeds 25,000 penalty points, to put that into perspec9ve META owns
Facebook and Instagram and had an annual turnover of $23.2 Billion in 2022 so that would
amount to a fine of $1.16 Billion. That will mean that rather than fact checking content
META will probably take down or not allow you to post certain content.

The problem with this is you must have a variety of informa9on for people to be able to
think for themselves and make an informed decision, for example during the pandemic a lot
of informa9on was deemed false by fact checkers and the chief health officer that turned
out to be true. Such as the use of Ivermec9n and Hydroxychloroquine for trea9ng COVID
pa9ents was seen as dangerous and ineffec9ve by the departments of health in Australia but
many doctors around the world disagreed and if it was not for dissen9ng voices in the
independent media it is likely that the Australian public would not be aware of alterna9ve
treatments. In a democra9c society ci9zens are en9tled to the full scope of informa9on to
make an informed decision.

Furthermore, limita9ons in regard to electoral and referendum maOers states that the
ACMA can intervene with content on a digital plaWorm service when it relates to preven9ng
or responding to disinforma9on. That is the job of the press to present the facts to the
Australian public not a government agency, when you commit a crime, you are not allowed
to inves9gate yourself and prove your innocence the courts will because you have a conflict
of interest. So, this should be no different. I am concerned that by allowing the ACMA to
interfere with online content rela9ng to poli9cal maOers that could open the door to
elec9on and referendum interference.

The Australian Government is not infallible nor incorrup9ble therefor you need checks and
balances like an independent press, the reason why in a court of Law we don`t allow Jury
members to know the Defendant is because there is a conflict of interest that will unblind
the applica9on of the law.

While I understand this Bill is an exposure drae and is subject to change, I find it very
concerning that members of Parliament are thinking in this way.

Sincerely,
MaOhew Lorcan Kelly.
