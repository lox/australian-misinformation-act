Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law. While I am also concerned about some
of the information on the internet which in many instances I would regard as being untrue, I do not consider putting
restrictions in place, based on an arbitrary determination of what is truth, is the appropriate way to deal with the
situation. I regard that as censorship and that it would pave the way for further restrictions in the future.

Instead, I firmly believe that it is definitely desirable to counter any disinformation with accurate information and to
continue to have discussion and debate as we have always been able to have in Australia. I consider this country to
be an outstanding example of a democracy, with all the protections that gives including for freedom of speech and I
would be very distressed to see that being undone as I believe this bill would do.

Please reject this bill.
