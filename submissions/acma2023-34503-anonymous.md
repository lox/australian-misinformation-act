     I am strongly against providing powers to the government (ACMA), or any
     government organisation to censor online articles, posts, comments and other
     online content. This includes powers to force big-tech companies to censor the
     views of Australians online, irrelevant of how "right" or "wrong" some may deem
     those views to be.
     It is never the place of government to be the arbiters of truth and such a
     concept is simply incompatible with a democracy.
     Additionally, the government claims that ... "Misinformation and disinformation
      pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our
     democracy, society and economy." However, censoring so called misinformation and
     disinfomation is actually more harmful, because it means those views are driven
     underground, and therefore the opportunity for rational individuals to challenge
     any disinformation is lost.
     Further, some governments are notorious for lying themselves. There is the risk
     is that overzealous government officials could use this bill to suppress
     challenges to those lies and provide barriers to those who wish to point out
     those lies. For example, if a government official accepts bribes, could that
     government official force companies to remove content relating to that bribe,
      because they get to be the arbiter of what is true?
     This Bill should never have even been conceived, let alone reach draft stage and
      be actually considered in any serious way.
     Instead, we need a constitutional amendment that is similar to the American
     first amendment, so that the government may never again propose rules that would
     oppress our freedom of speech.
