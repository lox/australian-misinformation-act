Dear Sir/Madam,
We are against the proposed Bill on Misinformation and Disinformation for the following reasons:-
The Bill is a significant overreach by the government.
The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under international human
rights instruments like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.
The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the public square
without transparency or accountability.
The Bill includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which risks it being weaponised to shut down
legitimate speech on pressing social issues.
The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable for excessive and onerous
policing of legitimate speech.
The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is hypocritical and inconsistent
and will establish an asymmetry that results in one rule for government and another rule for Australians in what
they can say.
The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of digital platforms to provide
information and evidence about misinformation and disinformation that is a worrying breach of privacy.
The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of censorship powers.
The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to freedom of expression are
tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for the interference with fundamental
rights of freedom of expression.
The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and standards and for failing to
provide evidence requested by ACMA is excessive and will provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.
Please consider removing this proposed bill.
Kind regards,
Paul and Louise Vocetti
