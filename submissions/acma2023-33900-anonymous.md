Dear Sir/Madam,


**s**


I write to express my strong concern and opposition to this bill.

This bill is an extremely dangerous encroachment on the freedom of expression in Australia.


The terms used in the bill are very open ended, will give the government an enormous amount of
power, and the power will inevitably will be misused and abused by governments and their bureaucrats
to allow only opinions in line with the government to be voiced, and penalties being issued to those who
allow alternative views to be voiced.

We see in this bill that the government sees itself and the educational institutions that belong to it, and
"professional" media organisations who are also very much in the pocket of governments as above the
law.


The bill is totally corrupt from the start.

What we need is actually the powers of the government and the government bureaucracy to be limited,
and the freedom of people instead to be respected and not infringed.


We have seen the government increasingly abuse the rights of people, and the government appears to
be bent on increasing its power and abuse.

The government and its bureaucrats have shown themselves to actually be the dangerous purveyors of
misinformation and disinformation, and it is the government and bureaucrats who should be having
their power restricted, and should be being held to account.


This bill is extremely dangerous and needs to be totally rejected.

What we need is for the government and its bureaucrats to be more and more limited, and power
removed from the government and bureaucrats.


Yours sincerely,
