**Re: The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

We urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental
rights of every Australian citizen as stated in:

1. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 19)

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers.

2. The Australian Human Rights Commission

“There is a real risk that efforts to combat online information and
disinformation by foreign actors could be used to legitimise attempts
to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce
ideological conformity in Australia.”

3. The Australian Human Rights Commission

“All efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation need to be
accompanied by transparency and scrutiny safeguards to ensure any
limitations imposed upon freedom of expression are no greater than
absolutely necessary and strictly justified.”

4. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a

multilateral treaty that commits nations to respect the civil and
political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of
religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and
rights to due process and a fair trial.

The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and
communication under international human rights instruments as listed above.

The Bill grants the government the authority to define truth, to control and
manipulate the flow of information and impose restrictions on online platforms
using vague, undefined terms with the risk of biased ideological interpretation.

Government and media censorship was on an industrial scale during the recent
Covid-19 pandemic. Factual information shared by qualified experts was
unfairly censored leading many to make less informed decisions about their
medical wellbeing, which impacted small business and services, job security, the
education sector, and mental health. The result was catastrophic to our
communities and economy. Such a totalitarian response from government in
partnership with media and large corporations has demonstrably damaged the
trust of people in the government’s ability to make informed decisions without
bias or outside interference.

Also of major concern is the government and media companies are exempt from
public accountability and oversight.

Our rights have been enshrined in various articles and declarations to protect
the free flow of information and ideas for good reason. This Bill is the antithesis
of those rights and we strongly urge the government to withdraw this Bill.
