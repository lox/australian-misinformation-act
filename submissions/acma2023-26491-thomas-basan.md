Dear Sir/Ma’am

SUBMISSION - EXPOSURE DRAFT OF THE COMMONWEALTH
COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING
MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION) BILL 2023

Thank you for the opportunity to provide a submission regarding the Exposure Draft of the
Commonwealth Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. The Draft provides for a Bill for an Act to amend the law relating
to communications, and for related purposes. The simplified outline highlights the purpose as
a graduated set of powers regarding ‘misinformation and disinformation’ on certain kinds of
digital platforms. With a stated aim to prevent or respond to ‘misinformation and
disinformation’ using a ‘code’ that platforms must comply with.

As context, the Department of Home Affairs identified Australian values as: ‘respect for the
freedom and dignity of the individual’…’freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and
freedom of association’. Australia is a founding member of the United Nations and an
original signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Article 19 reads:
_‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to_
_hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas_
_through any media and regardless of frontiers.’_

The Government argues that misinformation and disinformation’ (fake news) (but is silent on
mal-information (correct, but inconvenient information)) sows division within the
community, undermines trust and threatens public health and safety. The Government’s
solution to keeping Australians ‘safe’ online, is to ensure the Australian Communications and
Media Authority (ACMA) has the powers to hold platforms accountable for ‘misinformation
and disinformation’ on their services. It is very difficult if not impossible to reconcile the
values raised by Home Affairs, the text of the UDHR and the proposed legislation. Therefore,
as conceived and written the Exposure Draft is unsatisfactory, illegitimate and contrary to
Australia’s so called values; and should be abandoned.

The proposed law deals with a complex area of people’s lives and is susceptible to significant
government over reach. The fundamental concern with misinformation seems to be that once
**people have heard it, they tend to believe it and act on it, even after it’s been corrected.**
Even in the best of all possible worlds, correcting misinformation is not an easy task.
Legislatively, the issue central to the idea of ‘misinformation and disinformation’ and
potentially all the variation (mal-information etc) is what is – ‘the truth of a matter’. The
legislation does not seek to ensure the ‘truth of a matter’ is discerned and promulgated. The
main underpinning issues of this legislation are: what is ‘misinformation and disinformation’,
who decides what is ‘misinformation and disinformation’, who would be subject to the
legislation and who would be exempt from the legislation; and finally let’s address the idea of
‘harm’. For each of those issues, within the legislation, there is nothing but unsatisfactory
answers.

**What is ‘misinformation and disinformation’? According to the draft bill, misinformation**
is defined as ‘unintentionally false, misleading or deceptive content’ and disinformation as
‘misinformation intentionally disseminated to cause serious harm’. That is ‘misinformation’
and ‘disinformation’, ‘hate speech’ or ‘fake news’ is a label applied to statements, claims or
depictions that are considered by some entity as inaccurate; while disinformation, is a subset


-----

of misinformation intended to mislead or harm. Unfortunately, we have statements, claims, or
depictions that were considered inaccurate by ‘reputable’ entities, which subsequently have
been proven to be true. It is also true that individuals, organisations and even governments
have been shown to use ‘misinformation, disinformation and mal-information’ for their ends;
ends that are not in the interests of individuals or the community. Of those entities the worst
has been the government, often through its bureaucracy and at times through its armed
elements – the police and armed forces. The solution to ‘misinformation, disinformation and
mal-information’ has always been to ventilate the claims and prove them false or true using
robust argument, based on evidence - not fiat. Ventilating claims to dispute them through: its
compatibility with other known information, the credibility of the source, whether others
believe or agree with it, whether the information is internally consistent, and whether there is
supporting evidence; has worked well. That process of discernment is one of the great lessons
of the Enlightenment. The Labor Government, either by design or incompetence means to
take us back to the Dark Ages.

**Who decides what is ‘misinformation and disinformation’? The legislation has a**
registered ‘code’ deciding what is true or not. That is the decision on who decides is left to
the platforms, who are self-interested, motivated by profit and susceptible to government
coercion. Susceptible to government coercion, significant encouragement and joint
participation, is evident in the 4 Jul 2023 ruling by Judge T. Doughty, who wrote: “The
_government [The Federal Government of the USA] likes to claim that social media platforms_
_acting on their own would apply their p olicies and censor all this content. … The Louisiana_
_Court found that the platforms would not have suppressed this speech, but for the fact that_
_the federal officials were pushing for it.” So, is using a code developed by potentially,_
probably or actually compromised platforms really possible or sensible? I don’t believe the
‘code’ can, nor is it an appropriate mechanism to discern truth and therefore, there is a
significant concern that the legislation is ill-considered. To illustrate, are we going to be
confronted with the battle between the Ptolemaic and Copernican views of the place of the
world in the solar system all over again? In some respect the debate surrounding COVID is a
prominent example of the search for truth; a search, which might have caused less angst and
physical and mental harm, if openness, transparency and debate had been allowed and
encouraged from the beginning. There are many more examples that highlight that ideas can’t
be fixed; and must be worked through using evidence, logic and reason, not emotion, rhetoric
or fiat. Truth matters more than feelings or desires. Seeking truth takes time and must be
worked through, warts and all. Citizens must be brought into the discussion and inoculated
against fear by explaining to them what is known at the time, how they might be misled and
told what caveats apply to that knowledge. When confronted with a situation, information
evolves or bifurcates before stabilising into a trustable range. So keep our citizens wellinformed, well-educated and thus well-prepared.

**Who would be subject to the legislation and Who would be exempt from the legislation?**
The two questions will be dealt with together. The legislation separates the community into
two groups. The groups are the ‘truth-tellers’ (Government, news media and their believers)
and the ‘untrustworthy’ (everyone else). The legislation applies to all, except those exempt
and the exemption is essentially to the Government and ‘news’ organisations. Unbelievably
the single most concerning aspect of the Exposure Draft is that “content that is authorised by
the Commonwealth or a State” along with “professional news content” would have immunity
from the proposed ACMA powers. How are the supposed ‘truth-tellers’ to be disciplined for
lying? There is no answer in the legislation. The proposed bill invites comparisons to George
Orwell’s 1984, a novel where governments allow only their functionaries and state

-----

sanctioned news media to ‘guide’ the public discourse. The Government and its agencies
have lied or used ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’, ‘fake news’, ‘hate speech’ and malinformation on the community and individuals. Trusting ‘experts’ is not a function of science.
It is also not a function of democracy. It is a function of totalitarianism, and it does not make
for a healthier nation. We have seen the soul of our Government through its actions. During
times of war, we’ve experimented with troops (chemical weapons trial in WW2), lied about
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and altered official photographs (in Afghanistan);
during medical queries, such as Thalidomide or RAAF Deseal/Reseal programs the
government lied and obscured the truth, costing lives; the loyalty of people of German, Italian
and Japanese origin and descent was questioned during both world wars, leading to interment
and abuse; and the safety, effectiveness and rigor of the testing of the COVID ‘vaccines’ is
now being exposed as a lie, leading to excess Australian deaths well above the norm. It is
inconceivable that similar lies and actions would not occur again; and the proposed
legislation would make it harder to get to the truth, deal with wrong doers and compensate
the abused.

**Let’s address harm. The legislation provides the following meaning to harm (a) hatred**
against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender,
sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability; (b) disruption of public order
or society in Australia; (c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of
Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions; (d) harm to the health of
Australians; (e) harm to the Australian environment; (f) economic or financial harm to
Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy. Nowhere does it
**say that the ‘harm to truth’ is the principle wrong that is being addressed. The failure to**
address the truth as the core element that must not be harmed undermines the legislation and
invalidates it. We must search for truth, wherever it leads. We must not privilege institutions
or individuals over the truth.

In a democracy it is the obligation of the Government, institutions, organisations and
individuals to let citizens speak freely and express ideas even if those ideas might initially or
ultimately run counter to the majority viewpoint, on any given subject. Disagreement and
dissent is not violence, but a search for truth. Hurting people’s feelings is not violence, only
physical violence is violence. It is not the role of the Commonwealth to prevent the people of
Australia from saying silly things, or even things that might - in the eyes of government or its
agencies - cause ‘harm’. The impulse to decide which speech constitutes ‘misinformation’,
‘disinformation’, ‘hate speech’, ‘fake news’ or mal-information and must be censored is, at
heart, totalitarian. While Australian remains a democracy, it must not embrace totalitarian
practices.

In conclusion, by proposing the bill the Government enters murky waters. Terms like
‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’, ‘fake news’, ‘hate speech’ or ‘mal-information’ are
frequently used by critics, regulators, bureaucrats and political actors to smear ideas they
don’t like and to restrict people’s freedom to express those ideas. Very often, the use of such
terms betrays more about the people wielding them than the speech they wish to prohibit. The
enhanced powers of the proposed bill would grant the ACMA the power to effectively silence
countless individuals and organisations whose views on issues are subject to being falsely
characterised as ‘misinformation’ and / or ‘disinformation’ by Commonwealth agencies,
politicians, commentators, community leaders and media figures. If a government can censor

its critics, that’s a license for even greater atrocities. It is the beginning of totalitarianism and
once you start censoring, you’re on your way to dystopia and totalitarianism.

As a result, I am strongly opposed to the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

**Thomas BASAN**

**Postscript. Let’s embrace the 'truth', regardless of how uncomfortable it might be for some**
people. The truth can be a tough thing to bring out, especially late in the game, but it is
powerful and a great healer. Ultimately, there is a harmony, energy and resonance to the
Truth.
