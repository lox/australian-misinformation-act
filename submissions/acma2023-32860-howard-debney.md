The proposed “Misinformation” & “Disinformation” Bill is a proposal to limit Free Speech and
Expression of Ideas considered to be harmful to Australian Society.

**_The Truth has always been a threat to those who want to control thinking, speech and_**
**_the populace._**

It is in the Mechanisms of Democracy and only Democracy, with its checks and balances of
vigorous debate, free speech and expression of ideas, that we, as mere mortals come
closest to distilling the Truth.

Take this from Australians and we will decline rapidly as a society, succumbing to those who
would, for their own, less than noble agenda control the narrative and therefore the
sovereignty of our souls.

This is the greatest threat to Free Speech and our Democratic way of life because a
non-elected body ACMA – Australian Communications & Media Authority – will
effectively be given the power to determine what is True, what is False. It is out of
the Democratic realm into the hands of a body that can easily be manipulated by
whoever desires to harness the power of the people and resources of this nation.
That screams possibilities of Totalitarianism to me and it should for you.

**_Can you trust Governments? – Remember the War we had to have “because of_**
the weapons of mass destruction” – Lies and Fabrication which our Government and
Opposition bought into. If the powers of the new proposed Bill has been in force
then, anyone questioning this could have been silenced as spreading
“Misinformation” & “Disinformation”

We’ve seen Federal & State Governments of both sides of politics get it wrong
during the Pandemic by being themselves misinformed by those with either an
**_unscientific, unmedical, or a greedy and unethical agenda. All at the detriment of_**
the population that still suffers un-employability, lockdown trauma, and vaccine
injury, the latter including the ex-head of the AMA, Kerryn Phelps and her wife, who
is now calling for an inquiry into the vaccines and the measures taken during the
pandemic.

### Yet now the Albanese Government without a morsel of contrition are preparing a Bill that will silence any alternative view, by giving power to ACMA to issue massive fines to the Social Media Platforms if they don’t remove what they consider Misinformation and or Disinformation. 

**Remember what Misinformation was under Hitler’s regime**

## The Truth!

### Remember what Misinformation was under Stalin Communist regime

## The Truth!

### Remember what Misinformation is currently under Kim Jong Un of North Korea

## Yes again the Truth!

**_Remember – Anyone, who has ever wanted to restrict freedoms, censure thought,_**
or expression of ideas, and shackle the truth, in peace time, was never a good guy.
