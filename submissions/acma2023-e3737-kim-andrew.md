Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to express my strong opposition to the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I am deeply
concerned about the implications of this bill on our freedom of speech and the potential harm it
may cause to ordinary citizens.

Firstly, the existence of this bill indicates a blatant disregard for the freedom of speech that should
be upheld and respected by our government. By creating two classes of citizens, one with the
power to spread information deemed false or misleading, and the other stripped of that privilege,
the bill undermines the democratic values that our country should uphold.

It is my firm belief that the internet is a powerful tool for democracy, providing a voice to regular
people. This bill, however, poses a significant risk to those regular people, disproportionately
harming their ability to freely express their knowledge and opinions, which are often valuable and
insightful.

The excessive fines outlined in the bill would force digital services to become excessively
restrictive in their approach to speech, far more than the current standards allow. Moreover, the
broad application of the code across the entire industry without any "pressure escape valves"
creates an environment of fear and self-censorship, ultimately stifling open and honest
discussions.

It is impossible to accurately judge what is true or untrue, as new information continues to emerge
that challenges widely accepted facts. For instance, authorities and expert consensus have made
incorrect statements in the past about the effectiveness of masks in preventing COVID-19
transmission or the characteristics of the vaccine. Under this legislation, content related to such
evolving information could be subject to removal, even if it is not provably false.

Furthermore, the bill does not only target provably false information but also considers information
that is deemed "misleading" or "deceptive." Freedom of speech is invaluable precisely because it
allows for open and honest discussions, including the ability to be wrong and have debates to
ultimately find common ground.

Notably, even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has
expressed concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His scathing rebuke on the bill's
implementation and potential fines levied on information that may not always be misinformation
raises serious doubts about its effectiveness and credibility.

The extraterritorial application of this bill on foreign digital services is a gross overreach that
jeopardizes Australia's standing in the global Internet community. It is unreasonable to expect
foreign entities to comply with Australian law, particularly when they have no knowledge of it or
representation within Australian industry bodies. This overreach may lead to Australia becoming
an outcast in the global Internet landscape, further exacerbating the negative impact on our
citizens' access to information.

its its
every aspect of our legislation. Instead, both countries should respect digital sovereignty and the
ability of digital services to choose which laws to abide by.

Moreover, the proposed bill's impact on potential legal issues faced by Australians abroad, such
as fines or imprisonment when visiting foreign countries, further exemplifies the dangerous
precedent it sets. We cannot ignore the hypocrisy of admonishing other nations for similar
extraterritorial actions while suggesting the same approach ourselves.

The bill, in its current state, unreasonably extends Australian law onto foreign entities, displays a
self-entitled and ignorant attitude, and violates our legislators' constitutional power. It is essential
to recognize the constitutional freedom of political communication and ensure that any limitations
on legitimate discussions align with our democratic principles.

This bill diminishes the power of ordinary citizens to participate in public discourse and silences
certain viewpoints under the pretence of protecting minorities. It is crucial to acknowledge that
progress often occurs when previously accepted facts are challenged, and diverse viewpoints are
considered. The bill's single-code requirement leaves minorities vulnerable to the system's
pushback without any means of shelter or protection.

Furthermore, the threats imposed on digital platform providers and ordinary users pose significant
challenges and potential harm, including reputational damage, financial penalties, and business
inefficiencies. The prospect of being hauled before ACMA can cause distress and intrude on the
lives of ordinary citizens. This authoritarian approach contradicts the principles of mateship
ingrained in our Australian values.

Lastly, the bill fails to take into account the importance of diverse viewpoints and the experiences
and perspectives of ordinary Australians. By deplatforming certain views as misinformation, the bill
restricts the sense-making process essential for comprehensive decision-making in a democratic
society.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts to re-evaluate the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is imperative to protect freedom of
speech, encourage diverse viewpoints, and uphold the democratic values that define Australia.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take into account the concerns
raised and act in the best interest of all Australian citizens.

Yours sincerely,

Kim Andrew
