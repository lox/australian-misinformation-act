I, Paul Topic oppose in the Austalian Government introducing the proposed new laws to provide the
independent regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers
to combat online misinformation and disinformation.

The intention of the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 intention appears to be to create a frighteningly distopian future for
people of Australia. One only needs to look at the definition of "excluded content for misinformation
purposes" to see that what will be created is a ministry of truth in which corruptable Government
institutuions and Professional news services will become the heads of state for our permitted beliefs,
thoughts and ideas.

No individual or public body has the mental capacity to ascertain accurately what is or what is not
misinformation or disinformation. For growth of thought and growth of life, freedom to speak one's
own ideas and listen to others is essential in society.

The definitions of Harm are extremely loose and again, who gets to decide the threshold of doing harm
using communicative words. I have already observed that my posts on Youtube are being censored
when I write the word corrupt with Australian Government or Peter Dutton in the same comment. I
pehaps have caused harm to Peter Dutton or the democratic process using those words. However by
being sensored and silenced, our society is being harmed as we the people have our right removed to
call out corruption and injustice. The censorship of anything negative about covid vaccines was and still
is extreme on Youtube. As a result harm has been done to many many thousands of people who were
not given information on the harms and are now suffering severe vaccine side effects as society as a
whole had no informed choice to say no to the dangerous drugs and decide for themselves. Harmful
experimental vaccines did not line up with Government and Professional News propaganda.

So what is harm? Who is percieved to be getting harmed, and who will be harmed by censoring peoples
good thoughts and ideas that do not agree with a small elite group in ACMA, Government departments
and Proffesional news services?

The operation of this proposed law would definitely infringe on the constitutional doctrine of freedom
of political communication.

Whoever came up with the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 needs to be closely looked at to see where their true
intentions are and are they acting in the best interests of Australians or are they treasonously working
for a foreign power. This proposed Bill must be discontinued.

Thank you.

Paul Topic
