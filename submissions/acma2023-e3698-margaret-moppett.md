My submission re the proposed ACMA Misinformation/Disinformation law:

I wish to record my strong opposition to the Government's proposed legislation.
For the first time in my life I feel afraid of my government.
We vote our Parliamentarians in to protect our rights and to maintain our democratic way of life.
We Australians love our freedom. Freedom of speech is such a large part of that. It allows us to live feeling relaxed
and comfortable    - and grateful that we don't live in a society such as China where the state controls what it's people
can hear and read.
Governments are not fallible, because they are made up fallible humans. It would be wrong, then, for government to
be the arbiters of what is misinformation and disinformation. Same with the mainstream media.
It is offensive that we the people may be censored for what we say, but the government and MSM be exempt!
Politicians and journos have never proven to more holy, perfect and infallible than the man (or woman) on the street
And what they say is truth one day can be shown to be quite untrue later on. Case in point: Information provided to us
about Covid. ("We just need to reach 77% herd immunity"; "masks don't work"/masks then mandated; get vaccinated
and you won't catch/spread Covid"...)

I fear if this law passes that Social Media entities will err on the side of caution, and censure posts deemed only
borderline controversial. This will then have a chilling effect on what we decide to share in our postings.

One last thing    - with such a law in place, imagine if a malign government came to power. What they might do with that
power..
