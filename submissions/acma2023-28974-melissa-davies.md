Submission RE: New ACMA Powers to Combat Misinformation and Disinformation.
4 August 2023

I am writing to vehemently oppose the disgraceful proposed misinformation and disinformation
bill.

Democracy is built on free speech and this bill threatens the very essence of it.  The bill has
the power to silence debate and dissenting opinions and turn Australia into a modern-day
dictatorship.

The bill leaves us open to manipulation of public opinion by the regulation of information and
paves the way for totalitarian power. It will deprive us of the intelligence of public debate
and being able to question the integrity of public officials.

Debate is a potent force in exposing untruths, correcting lies and broadening perceptions.

It is the greatest single threat to free speech we have ever seen in this country. It is a total
misuse of authority.

With this bill, and without free speech, Australia will be a modern-day dictatorship. We have
to protect future generations from this disgrace.

I oppose the bill.

Regards,

Melissa Davies
