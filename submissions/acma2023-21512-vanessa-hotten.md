# I am vehemently in opposifion to this Orwellian proposal. I do NOT want ACMA, or any other bureaucrafic body, to have the power to dictate what is or isn’t the truth. I don’t believe they are capable or enfitled to control the disseminafion of informafion online, or elsewhere. Freedom of speech and freedom of expression are crucial. I do NOT and CANNOT support censorship.
