You cannot have democracy without freedom of speech or freedom of opinion. The censorship of all
opinions apart from those chosen by governments does not allow for a democratic society. This Bill
denies public opinion, freedom of speech, civil rights, and the right to reply. Without robust debate
within society, we cannot have open and transparent democracy. This bill is overreaching and
violates the Australian peoples inalienable human rights.

How can the truth prevail if the governments advisors are following false paths and no one elseâ€™s
opinions are permitted?
