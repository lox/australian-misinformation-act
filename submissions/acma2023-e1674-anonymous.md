To whom it may concern,

Please take the below as my anonymous submission to ACMA regarding the recent proposed changes to the departmental powers.

I do not support the new powers proposed to ACMA to decide what information is true or not. There are too many instances of institutional
mismanagement of information with heavy consequences.

Look at the price paid by Lindy Chamberlain when the court had it’s facts wrong. I’m concerned about the price still being paid by Julian
Assange as a whistleblower. Truth is extremely important to me and many other Australians. It sometimes takes years for it to come out and I
feel the proposed powers could prevent or lengthen the time truth takes to come out. Freedom of speech online is important. There needs to
be mechanisms in place to prevent miscarriages of justice. Whistleblowers need protection. Just because a branch of government purports
something to be the truth it is not necessarily so. Government bodies have historically been subject to manipulation.

Remember from the COVID pandemic we were all told that the vaccines were safe and effective? Here we are three years down the track and
the proof is in that the vaccines neither prevented infection nor the spread of the disease.

That is not all. There were severe consequences. Many people were injured by these vaccines. Some died. BUT, at the time speaking out
against vaccination was deemed as misinformation or disinformation. Now we are being asked to trust ACMA with more powers?

Please see below the extract from the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) for these vaccines
currently (less the 2 week lag period for the database). Current at 17/7/23:

I would suggest that the 138 912 cases (135 323 from single suspected medicine) and 995 deaths is significant. This should be further
investigated and advertising should cease stating these Covid medical treatments are safe and effective. Such advertising, apart from wasting
taxpayers money, is disrespectful for those who were injured or died and their loved ones.

I include the below link to the recently published data for Western Australia alone for 2021. Why it has taken so long for this to be released? It
is good information.

times higher than for all the other vaccines combined. Why is this not being advertised by government to the population at large? There is a
clear danger to the public and a need for further investigation. ACMA having more powers would limit online discussion of this.

Dr Robert Malone who had a significant role in developing the mRNA vaccine was injured himself. He has been vocal against the
pharmaceutical industry since then and particularly in regard to the dangers of the mRNA vaccines for COVID. He has recently been to court as
he was being silenced online for speaking out about the dangers. That judge ruled that the so called “Fact Checkers” were “Narrative
Reinforcers”. ACMA having more powers would be more power to these so called “fact checkers”.

I’m concerned about Electoral and Referendum content misinformation and/or disinformation being “in scope” of ACMA powers. Particularly
after the debacle of the last Queensland election which severely disadvantaged some independent candidates by the way electoral staff were
instructed.

I’m also concerned that the excess death data which is currently circulating and shows recent large increases from historical norms compared to
2019 data and before. This has not been picked up by mainstream media, but it is spoken about online in a massive way. This sort of
information would be within the scope of ACMA – but it is the sort of information which I would want access to. The Australian Bureau of
Statistics reports the excess death data, it is a government source but talk about the issue is limited to a few dedicated Australian senators and
online sources in Australian and abroad.

Thank you for considering my submission.

Please keep my details anonymous

Kind regards,
