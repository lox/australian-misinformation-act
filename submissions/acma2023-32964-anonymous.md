# SUBMISSION ON THE MISINFORMATION
 AND DISINFORMATION BILL

_“Power is not a means; it is an end.” - George Orwell, 1984_

Thank you for considering my submission on the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation
Bill. Like many, I am motivated to respond to the proposal in the hope that I can prevent the
further imposition of Orwellian style thought control in Australia, where the government
prescribes the truth and considers any deviation from the stated ‘truth’ to be dangerous
misinformation/disinformation.

### ANONYMOUS CONTRIBUTION

_“without anonymity in discourse, free speech is impossible, and hence also democracy.” - Nick Harkaway,_

_The Blind Giant_

I have chosen to remain anonymous because I work for an organisation best described as left
leaning and pro-Labor party. In contemporary Australia, without the veil of anonymity I am
unable to express an honest opinion, without the fear of losing my job and perhaps even my
profession[1]. This is extremely relevant when we discuss the proposed further encroachment
upon the already dwindling rights of Australian citizens[2].

Anonymity is of course an essential element of free speech, especially in a society like
Australia, which is trending further towards totalitarianism and an intolerance of ideas or
discussions that do not accord to the official state sanctioned “truth’ – something that is
particularly relevant to the current discussion.

### MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION

_“Democracies die behind closed doors. . . . When government begins closing doors, it selectively controls_

_information rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information is misinformation.” – Damon Keith_

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation)
_Bill 2023 (‘the Bill’) defines misinformation and disinformation in this way:_

_7 Misinformation and disinformation_

_(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service_

_is misinformation on the digital service if:_

_(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and_

_(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes; and_

_(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in_

_Australia; and_

_(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause_

_or contribute to serious harm._

_(2) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service_

_is disinformation on the digital service if:_

_(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and_

_(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes; and_

_(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in_

_Australia; and_

_(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause_

_or contribute to serious harm; and_

_(e) the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the content intends_

_that the content deceive another person._

_Note: Disinformation includes disinformation by or on behalf of a foreign_
_power._

The reader would have to be living in a vacuum to ignore the applicability of the above definition
of misinformation/disinformation to recent events, such as:

1. the response to the COVID Pandemic that the world has endured over the last few

years; and

2. the American election controversy during that same time period.

Unfortunately, both of those recent events serve to illustrate the serious risks associated with
classifying something as misinformation that is potentially harmful. I will not go into specifics,
because both topics remain subject to highly partisan and emotional viewpoints, with few people
being able to rationally discuss objective facts without displaying Pavlovian responses.
Needless to say, the narrative around COVID vaccinations and election interference has
evolved and changed significantly as more information has emerged over time.

In particular, the effectiveness of the vaccine at preventing transmission was overestimated in
the early stages, a fact now widely acknowledged in countries that value freedom of speech
such as the United States of America. Initially, social media companies, including Facebook
and Twitter strictly censored any discussion which departed from the official state sanctioned
narrative, eventually relaxing censorship as it became apparent the official state narrative was
incorrect and could not be supported by scientific fact. However, by the time censorship was
relaxed, many genuine scientists had their voices silenced because of a political agenda with
some losing their jobs or resigning in disgust.

The changing state of knowledge is true of many situations, especially novel situations where
the science and political understanding has not matured. To label a contrary position around a
scientific discussion as misinformation when the official government position is based upon
poorly understood or developing science, is to play a partisan political game and has no
scientific validity at all.

Censorship gets even worse when the topic is labelled misinformation/disinformation solely to
protect one political side from embarrassment, as was the case when the Hunter Biden laptop
scandal was labelled Russian disinformation by the US Government, referencing a letter by 51
former intelligence officials. The letter was an outright partisan lie, which is now being
investigated by the US House Judiciary Committee[3]. Once again, discussion of the Hunter
Biden Laptop was considered dangerous Russian disinformation that was prohibited from

-----

discussion on social media sites. Ironically, the story claiming the laptop was disinformation
was itself disinformation distributed by a political party to intentionally mislead the public.

The demonstrated ability for a sitting government to mistakenly or intentionally falsely label
something as misinformation/disinformation has proven to be too great a temptation to resist. It
is expedient for a political party to label information as misinformation/disinformation, especially,
when there is no penalty on that party when the lie or mistake is discovered.

### THE PREVIOUS LABOR GOVERNMENT’S ATTEMPT AT INTERNET
 CENSORSHIP

_“Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way_

_to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to_

_all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.” – Harry S. Truman_

In 2009, the previous Labor government attempted to introduce an internet censorship regime
by way of mandatory Internet Service Provider level filtering. Although the government at the
time claimed the mandatory censorship regime was to prevent child abuse material, the release
of the blacklist by Wikileaks proved extremely inconvenient to then communications minister
Stephen Conroy.

Wikileaks said in an editorial[4]:

_“…the blacklist for Australia contains an anti-abortion site, fringe religions, a dentist clinic, gay_
_sites, gambling sites, islamist sites, euthanasia activist sites, an astrologer's blog, misclassified_
_material, and, like Thailand, Wikileaks itself. Even the Australian government's "Minister for_
_censorship", Senator Stephen Conroy, has admitted that fully half of the sites on the secret list are_
_unrelated to child pornography.”_

Although the use of a secret blacklist to block sites outside of the publicly stated scope of the
ban is a disturbing abuse of power, it is hardly surprising. Without oversight, guaranteed

freedoms and penalties, the temptation for those in power to abuse censorship for their own
purposes is too great.

The mandatory filtering was eventually shelved, but not before the largest ISPs in Australia
agreed to implement the filter, effectively censoring to this day what Australians are permitted to
view. A fact that very few Australians are aware of.

In a poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s Hungry Beast[5], 70% of
respondents indicated that they were concerned that if a mandatory internet filter were put in
place, a future government would use it to restrict free speech or block websites they do not
approve of. It must be remembered that ABC audiences tend to trend left leaning and towards
increased authoritarianism. A more representative poll of the Australian people would likely
demonstrate an even higher level of concern, especially in the current climate where citizens
are becoming aware of government overreach.

### THOSE WITH THE MOST POWER TO SPREAD
 MISINFORMATION/DISINFORMATION ARE EXEMPT FROM PENALTY

_“Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.” -_

_Benjamin Franklin_

It is a sad fact that we live in a world where it surprises no one that the Government has
expressly excluded itself and the mainstream media from any accountability[6], despite the
government being the entity most capable of spreading dangerous
misinformation/disinformation, which has historically produced the most harm. For instance, the
danger of disinformation by the Western governments and the mainstream media became
horrifyingly real when the Weapons of Mass Destruction lies were perpetrated by Western
governments and spread by the press. It is difficult to quantify how many soldiers and civilians
have lost their lives or been permanently maimed and disfigured as a result of that lie.

net%20Regulation%20Survey%20-%20Report_FINAL.pdf

6 Section 2, The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


-----

If anyone should face severe consequences for spreading misinformation/disinformation it is
those in trusted positions of power who would use lies to incite war. However, the Bill ensures
this will not be the case and those most capable of doing harm are exempt from penalty.

### CONSENSUS IS NOT THE SAME AS FACT

_“I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its_

_tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid_

_debate by claiming that the matter is already settled.” – Michael Crichton_

There is a ridiculous notion being adopted by governments and media outlets around the world
that a consensus of scientific opinion creates an objective truth. This is simply untrue and likely
to lead to a stalling or even degradation of science.

Australia should be keenly aware that a highly skilled and knowledgeable individual can
disagree with an overwhelming consensus and be correct, forever changing scientific
knowledge and making the world a better place.  Australians should be aware of it, because
one of our best and brightest did just that.

Barry James Marshall argued against decades of medical consensus on the cause and
treatment of peptic stomach ulcers. The overwhelming consensus was that stomach ulcers
were caused by stress, spicy foods and too much acid. Mr Marshall argued that the consensus
was incorrect and that the bacterium H. pylori was the primary cause of stomach ulcers. Of
course, his research was ridiculed, with his research being rated in the bottom 10% of the
research that year. Still trusting in his own knowledge and research, Mr Marshall drank a broth
containing H. pylori, which caused him to develop stomach ulcers within three days.

Due to Mr Marshall’s unwavering resolve in the face of medical and scientific consensus, we
can now treat stomach ulcers by targeting H. pylori and in 2005, he was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine.


-----

If his research had been declared misinformation because it did not accord with the scientific
consensus, medicine would not have been advanced. The danger of censorship of ideas
cannot be overstated.

### CENSORSHIP IS VIOLENCE

_“The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual, crime.” - Max Stirner_

Disagreements between groups of people have existed for all human history and will continue to
exist for all time. There are only two ways to settle a disagreement:

1. By discussing and debating your viewpoint and arriving at a considered position; or
2. By way of physical violence.

Unfortunately for most of history, the default position has been to resort to violence to settle
disagreements. However, we as a species reached a point of enlightenment where the option of
debating a topic became a legitimate alternative to physically harming the other side.

As a result of enlightenment and introspection, the overwhelming majority of Western nations
have now recognised the importance of free and open discourse as a natural right and as an
alternative to violence; enshrining the right to free speech in either their constitution or their bill
of rights. Unfortunately, Australian politicians have chosen a different approach - denying their
citizens a guaranteed freedom of speech and restricting speech as much as possible; going so
far as to use tax-payer money to run court cases specifically to erode the implied constitutional
freedom of political commentary[7].

Censorship not only leads to violence but is an act of violence in and of itself: Any law that
restricts a person’s right to free speech must culminate in a threat backed by a willingness to
resort to violence. For instance, the Bill contains various financial and custodial penalties for
breaches. It would be concerning if the reader is not literate enough in jurisprudence to
understand that a custodial sentence is an act of violence by the state against an individual,

7 Comcare v Banerji [2019] HCA 23 (7 August 2019)

forcefully removing their liberty. However, a financial penalty also involves violence - a
government can only enforce a fine by threat or act of violence (physically seizing property
and/or overpowering/arresting anyone who resists).

The ability and willingness to exercise violence is necessary for the enforcement of all laws,
including the censorship against the Australian people that you are considering.

### YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE THE VILLAIN

_“A concern with 'public morality' is - if not the last refuge of a scoundrel - the first foray of the fascist.” -_

_Erica Jong_

There are three general categories of people who will read this submission:

1. The coward – this is a person who is very aware of their limitations and that they have

no way of successfully arguing a point or achieving a political goal without the enforced
suppression of contrary points of view. This submission is not written for the coward,
who I suspect would not have read this far anyway – good riddance to such a person,
they have no value in society.

2. Deep thinkers who have carefully considered their moral stance. This submission is

likely to be of little value to someone who has already carefully considered their position
and the immorality about further degrading the rights of Australian citizens. I thank you
for your careful consideration and wish you success in everything you do, we need more
of you, especially in positions of power.

3. The average person – This is someone who hasn’t fully considered the moral and

societal impact that further laws eroding speech in Australia will have. This submission
is aimed at the average person, and I implore them to do the right thing once they have
finished reading and considered what kind of person they want to be – Remember, right
now there are people in the future, including your ancestors and your future self, who are
watching, reviewing and judging your actions.

Please consider how you want history to remember you. Try to think of a politician or a figure in
history who has censored and restricted the rights of their citizenry and is recalled as anything
but an evil and tyrannical ruler who was despised.


-----

Citizens of other Western nations are right now posting on social media about the Bill and the
erosion of Australian rights in general as an example of what happens if people don’t carefully
safeguard their rights and freedoms. Australians are no longer counted amongst the free
nations of the world, instead being viewed alongside the people of Communist dictatorships.
Unfortunately, the social media posts made by the people of Western nations with guaranteed
free speech are not only factual but ironically, are the kind of social media posts that the
Australian government will remove as dangerous disinformation, once they have the power
under the Bill.

If you are a politician contemplating the Bill, do you really want to be viewed by the citizens of
Australia and other Western nations as a tyrant? Have you even considered this possibility
before? Or will you be content to be a coward, spending your remaining years on Earth
ordering social media companies to remove posts critical of you because you have no way of
otherwise justifying your actions?

**_How do you want posterity to recall you?_**

**_Will your ancestors be ashamed of their relation to you?_**

**_Will your ancestors change their name, so they are not associated with the dark_**

**_point in Australia’s history when you participated in creating an Orwellian_**

**_nightmare?_**

This may seem like hyperbole, but once again I say look to history, look to those who censor
and infringe upon the rights of their citizens and try to find one example where a person in your
position right now is not considered to be the villain.

Finally, I refer to a now famous sketch, where British comedians David Mitchell and Robert
Webb dressed as Nazis ponder if they are the bad guys[8] – this sketch perfectly highlights the
ignorance that people can experience in the moment when they are doing wrong.

8 That Mitchell and Webb Look – “are we the bad guys?”

### YOU CAN BE THE HERO

_“Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes.” - Benjamin Disraeli_

If you are in a position to decide this matter, this is an opportunity for you. You have been
entrusted by the people of Australia to do the right thing and to make Australia a better place.
Choosing freedom over tyranny and voting against the Bill is a positive first step, you will have
taken a stand and voted against the further erosion of the rights of Australia’s citizens. It will be
a good feeling and will be something you can be proud of, loudly boasting of how you couldn’t
allow such a thing to happen.

But is that enough? Why not continue down the path of the hero and choose to be remembered
for more than just voting against the Bill? Why not give Australians rights, rather than take them
away? Why not be remembered as the author or amongst the authors of a historic bill of rights
for the Australian people, which includes an absolute freedom of expression? You don’t have to
waste your career and life mired in mediocrity, you can choose a path of greatness and make
your ancestors and even your future-self proud of your achievements - knowing that posterity
will recall you amongst the pantheon of heroes rather than villains.

## THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE ARE TRUSTING YOU – EARN IT.
