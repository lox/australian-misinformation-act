###### Exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 20231

The material presented herein addresses the current federal Government's (Labor's) draft Bill
(title above) and was compiled and submitted by:

Mr. Dean S. Brooks
Citizen and resident of Australia
20 August 2023

###### 1 consent to this submission being made public, minus my contact details.

Upon first learning of this Bill, I had an initial and significant 'gut reaction' which compelled
me to participate. However, as I delved into its details, I chose to consciously constrain
emotion and instead apply rationality. Exploring, risk-assessment style, the likes of plausible
###### and possible' irrespective of `likelihood', I attempted my approach per what I am trained to
do, impartial, objective, open-minded `hyper-critical' analysis and assessment. I hope those
who explore, consider and debate with others what is shared here will consider the examples
and lines of reasoning similarly. Though this approach took me far from the path that had
initially sprung to mind, for me it has proven immeasurably superior and revelatory. Tt has
revealed profound insights. They have triggered life-changingly deep introspection. For me,
those insights are gratifying, unexpected, paradigm-shifting, and deeply unsettling. Core
human belief systems, regarding knowledge, facts, opinion, science, religion, media, the
judiciary, etc., when exposed and dissected, were shattered.

This submission addresses `only' the 'Part 1 —Introduction' of the draft Bill. That part
constitutes a summary inclusive of what I refer to as 'the bases' of the Bill. The remainder of
the Bill is not given treatment herein. That remainder (for example, 'Part 2—Information',
outlining instruments by which the Bill, through ACMA, might be implemented in practice)
assumes the Bill has sufficient legal merit (court-case interpretability) to warrant being
enacted. This submission questions and tests 'the very bases' of the Bill.

"Presented with someone else's argument, we're quite adept at spotting weaknesses. Almost
invariably, the positions we're blind about are our own." (Kolbert, 2017, Why Facts Don't
Change Our Minds, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-
change-our-minds ). Mindful of my own blindness, humbly presented here is a compilation
based on assessing both historic human (in)ability to distinguish `information' from so-called
`misinformation', and; the `credibility' of institutions, in terms of whether any may be
justifiably held to be more credible than others. Whereas many subject-specific publications
(text books and peer-reviewed journal articles) reviewed as part of this assessment offered
definitions of terms such as `information' and `misinformation', none of them examined a
critically important component toward deep and necessary understanding: how we process
information. This analysis attempted to do this, and may encourage readers to do so also.

###### A. The focus items ('the bases') of this submission are as highlighted below, namely, key 'definitions' within the draft Bill.

Part 1.7(1) of the Bill defines 'misinformation' as: "information that is false, misleading
###### or deceptive" and that is; not "excluded content" (both this term, and `content' are defined in
the Definitions section), and; "is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm".

Part 1.7(2) of the Bill defines 'disinformation' as per 'misinformation', except with the
addendum "that the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the content
intends that the content deceive another person." [emphasis added; extracts copied below]

###### 1. Preface

 No number of sightings of white swans can prove the theory that all swans are white. The sighting of just one black one may disprove it.

AZ QUOTES

The essence of these quotes is that: countless `confirmations' of an `hypothesis' or `theory',
such as through observations, may appear to reinforce its believability and apparent validity.
But it takes only a single contrary observation, 'an ugly fact' to render it either invalid or at
least in need of refinement. After all, an hypothesis, is just a `guess', or an approximation, and
should never be elevated to the status of `truth' or 'belief', though many, unjustifiably, are.

The Earth may once have been thought of and described as being `flat', or a `sphere', or an
`oblate spheroid'. It is none of these. All are merely misleading approximations of the reality.

This submission explores whether: yna `information' may be regarded as `misinformation',
and ma [institution ][or ][individual ][as ][`authoritative' ][and ][therefore ][(by ][inference) ][`credible'. ]
Though just one Ugly Fact suffices, for completeness, emphasis, and toward eliciting
personal rational and emotional resonance from at least some, conveyed here are many.

vaccines are both safe and effective)
(Heckenlively's biases assume international, `inviolable' Nuremberg-based `Human
Rights', and that many past `medicines' have had horrendous risks:benefits profiles).

Opposite interpretations, from identical information, but different `perspectives':

The subtlest of word choices, and/or of how words are strung together in a sentence, i.e he
`simple' communication of information, can change meaning entirely. `Information' may be
transformed to `misinformation' or vice-versa. And this may happen, and/or go unnoticed, at
every step. When an observation is made. When it is reported. When a report is interpreted.
When interpretations are translated or shared. Then re-shared. And re-shared. . .

Correctly!!

All other `knowledge' acquired by an individual may be regarded literally, as hearsay.

The only witnesses to a crime are the perpetrator(s), victim(s) and other `eye-witnesses'.

The only ones who can attest to any event, discovery, observation, are those actually present.

Ugly Fact? Individuals, `know' (from personal observation, and relative to all knowledge)
next to nothing, and, much of that is misremembered. All other personal `knowledge' derives
from others, hence is in effect hearsay, and the accuracy and integrity of that `information' or
`misinformation' either assumed or dismissed, based on our pre-existing biases.

Ugly Fact? What we think we know, is eclipsed by far by what we don't. And then some.

Irrespective of whether any institutions 'get it right' more often than others, none do always.

Irrespective of their hierarchic level within society, ultimately, institutions are compromised

Irrespective of the `qualifications', `professionalism', `expertise' or experience of individuals,
they are humans. So-called `experts' get things wrong, (and, `non-experts' get things right)!

###### 4. Context behind the Huxley and Popper quotes: `Misinformation' for Millenia, becomes Fact (i.e. `Information') ...

Belief: Swans are only white.

Suggestion otherwise was `Misinformation' Australia discovered.

Black swans also!

###### Excerpt from Australian Geographic:

[B]elief in Europe, dating back 2000 years to Roman poet Juvenal, [was] that
swans are invariably white. Like purple cows and flying pigs, the black swan
was a symbol of what was impossible. In medieval Europe, unicorns had
more credibility'. [emphasis added]

'Low, T. (2016, Jul 11) Black swan: the impossible bird.
https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2016/07/black-swan-the-impossible-
bird/

Lest we forget: A 'Black Swan' event is one with three characteristic attributes: (1) it is
unprecedented, 'an outlier', and therefore, right up until it happens, regarded as nonsense,
inconceivable, impossible, (i.e., as `misinformation'); (2) it makes an extreme impact; (3)
only after the fact, we attempt to rationalise that it was possible, conceivable, predictable.

or both simply `Information'

Ugly Fact? The proposed Bill demands that decisions would need to be made on such
examples. And enforced. Historically, different cultural, e.g., ideological beliefs, have led to
`serious harm', (including war), avoidance of which is an expressed intent of the draft Bill.

Ugly Fact? By extension, making wrong decisions, e.g., based upon data merely perceived or
deemed to be `misinformation', may also (lead to serious harm).

###### 7. Ugly Fact? Perceptions of what is or is not `misinformation' oscillate.

The diagram below approximates how Huxley's and Popper's insights unfold as oscillations.

Initially, observations, (a discovery or event, etc.) inspires a Theory/Belief 1 (green below).
Later, a contrary finding inspires an alternative Theory/Belief 2 (red below), and support
('Consensus') for it may increase as observations unfold. Yet later, a new finding disproves
Theory/Belief 2 and/or reinstates if not reinforces Theory/Belief 1, and support for it.

Neither theory changes, only the respective degrees of evidence for each. But belief in each
does. Believers are shifted, from among the `consensus' *- to, the 'minority'-group, merely by
new events/facts. During periods when in the `minority', each group may be respectively
classified as `misinformed', and pronouncements from them labelled as `misinformation'.

Note: As time proceeds, awareness of each theory may grow, and therefore also `opinion
###### inertia'. In other words, it becomes increasingly difficult to shift beliefs since there are so
many who may be aware of and perpetuate existing dogmas, unaware of or resistant to new.

"In the bulk of popular, media and scholarly discourse on Azaria Chamberlain's
disappearance there is overwhelming consensus that the sensationalist reporting of the
event convicted parents Michael and Lindy of their daughter's murder outside official
court processes", that in effect, the case was a "trial by media " i. [emphasis added]

An insider perspective, from Lindy's current partner, is that the media releases, even if not
`sensationalist' per se, were heavily biased (hence, in effect, ['misleading'*)] in reporting the
prosecution as against the defence case, for different respective reasons, (as may be typical
with high-profile cases):

[V]ery often the only ones giving out interviews [] was the Northern
Territory government, even though the `news' was Crown point of view —
that Lindy had murdered her daughter. Because of the way the Crown ran
the case after the first inquest, the Chamberlain's defence had very little
idea what the Crown would say, or what witnesses the Crown would call
until they saw it happen in the courtroom. The defence did not give
interviews, because doing so would give the Crown a further unfair
###### advantage. [emphases added; Ultimately, not doing so seemed to.]

*Two examples of `consensus' in this case: (1) of presumed guilt (75%, news/middle image, despite
the evidence, i.e., based on `misinformation'), and; (2) that the media, such as by conducting then
reporting on an opinion poll, contributed to bias across Australia that led to the `guilty' verdict.

After generations of incremental societal change, majority opinion flipped and long-held arguments
evaporated. The industrial revolution saw economic development and upended long-standing social
structures and institutions. Homesteaders transitioned to factory work. Large families were no longer
necessary for survival. `Norms' surrounding marriage and child-rearing changed. People interacted -
more with others, less with kin - and respective influences shifted. With membership in multiple tribes
came freedom to change minds, [including on religion], without social penalty. Ultimately, marriage
became less about reproduction, more about love. But the LGBTQ (same-sex) community still had to
fight for decades until this came to be recognised and accepted by others. "Once choosing to not have
a big family was normal, and choosing to marry for love was normal, and choosing to divorce for lack
of love was normal, the idea of choosing to not have children, have children without marrying, or just
cohabitate and do neither all became normal [and acceptable] as well."

###### 13a. Is it the case, that irrespective of 'the evidence', how we perceive 'information' boils down to mere opinion/belief?

A classic example of scientific inquiry gone wrong': research into the cause of chronic
peptic/gastric (stomach) ulcers. From 1875, there had been two prevailing* theories of the
cause of stomach ulcers: (1) stomach acid, (2) bacteria, (*lesser suspects included stress.)
Based on conclusions from a 1954 study, the acid theory prevailed thereafter.' For 40 years.

However, in 1982, a compelling self-experiment, (which led to a Nobel Prize, to Australians
Marshall & Warren in 2005) demonstrated both that the primary cause was a bacterium, and
that a simple effective treatment could be applied, antibiotics'. But this was not formally
accepted until 1994, (by the NIH2'3). Others had made the same discovery earlier, including
Yao & Dong 1970-80, and Dr. Lykoudis through 1960-70. Lykoudis was so disbelieved, he
could not find a publisher and his finding was deemed so absurd that he was de-registered.
Only much later (2002) was the 1954 study found to have been flawed.'

ESSAY
###### Why[ost Clinical Research Is Not Usefu]

John P.A. Ioannidis''2.

t Stanford Prevention Research Center, Department of Medicine and Department of Health Research and
Policy, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, United States of America, 2 Meta-
Research Innovation Centerat Stanford (METRICSI, Stanford University, Palo All California, United States
of America

Educational institutions incorporate research facilities. Their endeavours result in findings
published as thousands of j ournal articles each year. Research spans fields from science to
medicine, and while some may be `blue-sky', most medical research (for which there have
been many millions of papers published on clinical research, approximately 1 million on
clinical trials, and tens of thousands based on systematic reviews), should (ideally) translate
into clinical usefulness.

But, per the above article's title, and as explained within it, most does not. Among a suite of
other reasons for this that are discussed by the author, was found that much clinical research
is industry-funded, is not transparent, and is not even patient-centred. (If this is the case,
the bases for the research are likely driven by other motives, including publication
proliferation - the more papers one succeeds in getting published, the higher one's deemed
esteem, and more secure one's tenure with one's employer - or self-interested profit.)

Worse: as is self-explained within its title (below, in reference to most fields of research)...

Xd. "Educational Institutions" — Not a Source of Misinformation?

Failures in scientific research - to produce meaningful, informative, as against misleading and
even opposite-to-truth, `misinforming' if not 'disinforming' results - abound and for a host of
reasons, including:

###### • `Replication Crisis': the findings of original researchers were more
often than not unable to be replicated by subsequent researchers.

###### • Sample Sizes Too Small - i.e., studies `underpowered'. The smaller the
sample, the bigger the potential error.

###### • `Selective Reporting' - researchers only publishing positive results.
 • Changing hypotheses to retrofit the data
 • Lack of transparency, including failure to disclose conflicts of interest
 • Industry Bias or Manipulation
 • Confirmation Bias
 • Etc.

###### Testimony Reveals FBI Employees Who Warned Social Media Companies about Hack and Leak Operation Knew Hunter Biden Laptop Wasn't Russian Disinformation

July 20, 2023 Press Release
WASHINGTON, D.C. — On July 17, 2023, the House Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government conducted a

transcribed interview of Laura Dehmlow, the Section Chief of the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF). During her transcribed interview, Dehmlow

revealed that the same FBI personnel who were warning social media companies about a potential Russian "hack and leak" operation in the run-up to the
2020 election knew that the laptop belonging to Hunter Biden was not Russian disinformation. After the New York Post broke a story based on the contents
of the laptop about Biden family influence peddling, the FBI made the institutional decision to refuse to answer direct guestions from social media companies

about the laptop's authenticity—despite months of constant information sharing up to that time. Put simply, afte the FBI conditioned social media companies

to believe that the laptop was the product of a hack-and-dum o eration, the Bureau stopped its information sharing, allowing social media companies to
conclude that the New York Post story was Russian disinformation.

Xg. "Government" — Not a Source of Misinformation?

###### Trump's false or misleading claims total 30,573 over 4 years

Analysis by Glenn Kessler. Salvador Rim and Meg Kelly

January 24, 2021 at 3G0 a.m. EST

. . . "averaging [only*] about 21 erroneous claims a day" 1

According to The Washington Post, during his term as President, Trump made "false or
misleading" claims on numerous topics, including the economy, foreign policy, environment,
election, and coronavirus, and repeated some claims hundreds of times.2

Trump's tallies may seem extraordinary (high). But this may be the first instance of dissection
of recorded speech from one person across years. How might others compare? `Humans are
fallible', gullible, corruptible... It is likely that most people lie — ("I'm on my way", "1 didn't
do it", "It's not about you", "I'm well", "I love you", "Sincerely yours", "Pleased to meet
you", "You look good", "I agree", . . .). Realistically, some individuals, (e.g., politicians) may
need to talk and process and respond ad hoc (unedited), and lots, so their mistruth counts will
likely inherently be higher than for less talkative and/or less-pressured others. But even in a
relatively benign setting, one study3 found that 60 percent of people lied at least once, and
told an average of —3, and up to 12, lies during a 10-minute conversation.

###### Xi. "The Judicial System" (also) — Not a Source of Misinformation?

As an ultimate `litmus test', one may set aside for a moment that the examples in the previous
pages, and countless others back through history, demonstrate continuous if not inevitable
failure of institutions (humans) to identify or even accurately define `misinformation'.

Judicial systems, over and above all other institutions presumably deliberately intend and
evolve toward attempting to identify truth, hence should, at least in theory, be most robust
toward achieving this. After all, decisions made through them decide fates of lives. However,
cases get re-trialled, and escalated via appeals processes, and escalated again because there is
a hierarchy of higher courts through which such may be facilitated. Might inability to
unequivocally determine cases, first-time be, at least in part, attributable to `misinformation'?

###### If the Lindy Chamberlain case is not compelling enough ('a single ugly fact') for all
Australians, and possibly many others, how has adjudication of the most serious crimes, those
resulting in a decision of `death penalty', faired?

###### • US study examined every capital conviction and appeal between 1973 and 1995
(nearly 5,500 judicial decisions made in 34 states)

###### • 68% of America's death sentences were overturned on appeal as a result of serious
error

###### • The three most common errors: (1) egregiously incompetent defense lawyers (37%);
(2) prosecutorial misconduct, often the suppression of evidence of innocence (19%);
and (3) faulty instructions to jurors (20%). ['misinformation' emphasised]

###### • For retrial cases whose outcomes are known, an astonishing 82% of retried death
row inmates turned out not to deserve the death penalty.'

Vc. How did Pfizer and BioNTech convey their claimed Efficacy result?

Pfizer and BioNTech did not mention the 0.84% figure anywhere, but highlighted the (more
business-favourable) 95% figure (in its Results copied below) and elsewhere in its report:

###### The NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL of MEDICINE

ESTABLISHED IN 1812 DECEMBER 31, 2020 VOL. 383 NO. 27

###### Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine

RESULTS
A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received
###### injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with lacebo. There wer of
Covid-19 with onset at least 7 da s after the seco d- dose among participants as-
###### signed to receive and among those assigned to I 9lacebd;
BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval 90.3 to

###### defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions.

The calculations (A and B) on the preceding page represent `Relative Risk' and `Absolute
Risk' respectively. Both metrics are understood, explained or advocated for by some (e.g.,
Noordzij et al 20171). Relative Risk indicates how much more or less likely an outcome may
be in one group compared with another, but nothing about the likelihood of the outcome
occurring. Absolute Risk indicates the likelihood that an outcome may occur.:

###### • [O]ne cannot be interpreted without the other.
 • The relative risk is most often used, especially in studies showing
the effects of a treatment.

Page 42 of 63


-----

###### Vd. Was the Efficacy result claimed/promoted by Pfizer and BioNTech for their Covid-19 vaccine honest/fair or deceptive/misleading?

Mandated by some for claims being made by others, is inclusion of both Relative Risk and
Absolute Risk figures, or the equivalent, to ensure claims are balanced and unambiguous.
The Code of Practice for the Pharmaceutical Industry is a standard of the Prescription
Medicines Code of Practice Authority' (PMCPA, UK). A complaint to PMCPA was made by
a member of the public about a `misleading press release' issued by Pfizer and BioNTech 2
Dec [20202,] (and a related release by another party) on efficacy claims considered biased. The
PMCPA investigated and ruled that breaches (plural) of the Code had been made:

The complainant noted that only the RRR [relative risk reduction] results
were presented, with no mention of ARR [absolute risk reduction] in
breach of the Code which specifically required that any discussion of RRR
must include presentation of ARR results too. A breach of [clauses 7.2
and 9.1 of the 2019 version of] the Code was ruled 3.

###### Clause 7.2 Misleading Information, Claims and Comparisons

 • reference to absolute risk and relative risk. Referring only to relative risk:, especially with regard to risk reduction, can make a medicine appear more effective than it actually is. In order to assess the clinical impact of an outcome, the reader also needs to know the absolute risk involved. In that regard relative risk should never be referred to without also referring to the absolute risk. Absolute risk can be referred to in isolation

###### Vf. Could vaccine efficacy claims be misleading, misinterpreted, mistranslated, etc., i.e., be and/or become `misinformation'?

Claim, Pfizer': BNT162b2 was 95°/o effective in preventing Covid-19

Contention: Claiming that the vaccine was 95% effective assumes that it did something. The
trial data showed that there were 95%ewer infected cases, vaccinated versus placebo, not
that the vaccine was effective. `Fewer' is unequivocal. `Effective' is an assumption, merely
suggested. The difference could have been for any number of other plausible reasons, for
example, more or larger `waves' of the virus, or a cluster, may have permeated more locales
of placebo subjects than vaccinated subjects; more of the vaccinated group may have
frequented outdoor and/or lower density and/or windier or higher fresh-air-turnover and/or
drier-air (i.e., virus-spread-suppressing) locales.

An alternative conclusion from Pfizer's own data: `Natural immunity imparted high
protection against COVID, after all, over the entire trial duration, only 162 of 18,325 in the
placebo group, less than 1%, became infected. Given this result, mass vaccination appears to
be unjustified.' This highlights how questionable Pfizer's claim of efficacy against infection
was. The total number of subjects infected was trivially small versus the total subjects in the
trial, 170 vs 36,523.

Claim, Greg Hunt: The vaccine "is safe and effective".

Contention: Such statements are unjustified assumptions based only on trials (Pfizer, Astra
Zeneca, etc.) Converting past tense (as used correctly by Pfizer, above) to present tense is
misleading and hence, by applying the definition in the draft Bill, (see section A),
`misinformation'. A correct claim would be: "were safe and effective . . . in trials...")

If, the vaccines worked (as the manufacturer's claimed), such was demonstrated only in the
trials (which were past, hence should only have been referred to using past tense). Whether or
not they would work (future tense) in real world populations, had not yet been established.

Claim, Professor Brendan Murphy: The vaccines "are" particularly good at preventing
"severe disease".

Claim: Professor John Skerritt2: "They work and [] they're safe".

Contention: Same as per previous. Results in controlled trials (past/"was") do not necessarily
equate to similar results in subsequent (future), at-that-time not-yet-undertaken non-trial
populations. : They /they M. They /they ~.

###### 20. Is there 'fact'/'fiction'/'fake'/'spin', 'information'/'misinformation', 'right'/'wrong; 'black'/'white', etc. or only our of these?

Fact? (1): Convex lenses invert light that passes through them, images appear inverted.

Facts? (2): The lens of the eye is convex. Light from objects arrives upside-down on the
retina. Yet, we do not perceive the world we see as upside-down. The brain `corrects'.

Fact? (3): In repeated experiments with prismatic inversion goggles (see Sachse et at, 20171)
subjects 'see' the world upside-down, initially. But in time, the plastic mind re-'corrects'.

Paradox?: These `facts' appear to demonstrate that what we perceive as `facts' are 'in fact'
just that, mere `perceptions' or `interpretations', by the brain. Throughout life the brain
continually and iteratively processes and adapts based on a myriad of experiences unique to
each individual, so that individuals may function in the correspondingly unique interpretation
of the world as it appears, only in their `mind's eye', to them.

###### 21. Are we in conscious control of what we believe, or we `know'.
 Or do we misinterpret, mislead, misinform ourselves?

The following will be a one-time-only, unrepeatable experience. Read at normal speed. Don't
skim, give up halfway, or skip ahead. As you read, ask yourself how you feel about the
paragraph.

A newspaper is better than a magazine. A seashore is a better place than the
street. At first it is better to run than to walk. You may have to try several
times. It takes some skill, but it is easy to learn. Even young children can
enjoy it. Once successful, compli-calions are minimal. Birds seldom gel too
close. Rain, however, soaks in very fast. Too many people doing the same
thing can also cause problems. One needs lots of room. If there are no
compli-calions, it can be very peaceful. A rock will serve as an anchor. If
things break loose from it, however, you will not get a second chance.

Is the paragraph comprehensible or utterly meaningless? Can you conceive of even one
potential explanation, or several, of what it may be about?

Now experience afresh (re-read, and see) what happens when you re-interpret it, after being
presented with a single clarifying word: kite.

Suddenly everything fits; every sentence works and has meaning. Now it is impossible to
regain the sense of not understanding. In an instant, without due conscious deliberation, the
paragraph has been irreversibly infused with a `feeling of knowing'. Though it could be about
something entirely other - an abstract poem, a collage of fortune-cookie quotes - the mind
now balks at possible alternatives. Reinterpreted information became `knowledge'.

###### Concluding Statements

This assessment questioned and tested 'the bases' of the Bill, and appears to lead to the
conclusion that they are invalid. Any (further) debate, such as around who might decide what
is 'disinformation' or 'misinformation', and how, is superfluous. The main body of this
submission (above) demonstrates that such categorisations cannot be made with justifiable
rationale.

Presented here was a compilation demonstrating that humans have been consistently
incapable of distinguishing `information' from so-called `misinformation', that both entities
interchange with one another, do so unpredictably (black swans, 9/11), or do so over extended
time-frames (scientific research, same-sex relationships). Further, outlined is not just that this
is the case, but introduced and explained here are some of many insurmountable reasons why
this is the case, supported by particularly high-profile examples. This submission likewise
shows that although some institutions might be regarded as 'more authoritative' than others,
fundamentally, and demonstrably, there is little distinction between the `credibility' of any
sources of information. Not only do none 'get it right' all the time, or even most of the time,
most get it wrong most of the time, even those deemed (superficially and arbitrarily) to be at
`higher' levels. This includes information-sources the Bill implies - by virtue of entities it
defines as `excluded-content'-sources - as supposedly `credible' if not faultless.

This submission introduced and explained numerous, typically insurmountable reasons as to
how `information' evolves, morphs, switches places with, and is therefore synonymous with
and indistinguishable from so-called `misinformation' and hence that: `misinformation'
###### cannot be identified with any confidence.

 • One's `misinformation' can be another's `truth' (and both/either may be
unprovable; religion vs creation).

###### • `Misinformation' can flip to `information' (reality), and vice-versa, based
on a single ugly fact (black swans, 9/11, etc.).

###### • To what extent something maybe regarded as `true' or `false', information
or `misinformation', depends, and may oscillate. (Lindy Chamberlain,
cholesterol, peptic ulcers, etc.)

###### • `Misinformation' is abstract, variable, arbitrary, transient, intrinsically intangible. If not a firm belief, it shifts, like a switch, black-to-white, or
through shades of grey (same-sex relationships).

###### • Stepwise evolution of information may develop through serial amendments
to (cholesterol), or reinforcements of (climate change), pre-existing
information, but a single (new) ugly fact can instantly flip all previous pre-
existing Infomiation to `Misinformation'; and `legacy confusion' result.

###### • Opposite conclusions can, unsurprisingly, arise from opposing or at least
different information/knowledge bases, even from the same data (books for
vs against vaccination).

Page 54 of 63


-----

###### • More surprisingly, opposite conclusions can also arise from identical
information, but different `perspectives' or approaches, i.e. one's
information is another's `misinformation' (UHCL-1/Parkinson's gene,
Pfizer Phase 2/3 Covid-19 trial).

###### • Humans are exceptionally imprecise in their communications (claims
inclusive of `minor' slips in word choice, e.g. usage of wrong tense, can
entirely change meaning from information to misinformation)

###### • What we think we know, is eclipsed by far by what we don't. And then
some.

###### • We keep forgetting this.

 • Individuals, `know' (from personal observation) next to nothing. All other
personal `knowledge' derives from and may either assume or dismiss the
accuracy and integrity of, information — in effect `hearsay' — from others.

###### • Humans are fallible, therefore, if not - also - already Common Knowledge

 • All sources of information (humans, and institutions - being comprised of
humans) are also sources of misinformation and disinformation.

###### • `Consensus' is a political construct, not a scientific concept (and required of
juries but not some panels of judges).

###### • Much `belief as to what appears to be `information' or `misinformation',
whether within those who might be regarded as `informed' or
`misinformed', arises from being `uninformed' i.e., ignorance. No surprise
given the continuous overwhelming flood of new information that enters the
world each moment, and the multiple opportunities for message to be
distorted, (from observation to reporting, translating, sharing, etc.).

This submission likewise demonstrates that although some institutions might be regarded as
###### ,
more authoritative' than others, fundamentally there is little distinction between the
`credibility' of any individual sources of information. Not only do none 'get it right' all the
time. Most get it wrong lots of the time, even at the deemed `highest' levels, as summarised
below:

###### • Analysed by peers, science community publications found to be as often
wrong as right.

###### • Likewise, MediaWatch has highlighted countless failures by its peers, over
34 years.

###### • Trump, a US president, over 30,000 false or misleading claims in 4 years.

 • When scrutinised, even the judiciary's `success rate' might be bettered by
coin-tosses.

When I commenced compiling this submission, I, perhaps like many others, started with a
host of personal preconceptions and biases, and intended to 'go into battle' defending or
making a case for those. That is not, however, how this unfolded. What unfolded was an
organic iterative process of contemplation, fact-finding, discoveries, and continuous revision
and concerted self-critique. From this arose the insights, now shared here, that surprise even
myself, (and which I find unsettling but concrete). The conclusions, and even the
introduction, were The insights led to them. Not the other way around.

The insights seem robust.

The conclusions seem inescapable.

The draft Bill appears to have no rationally defendable basis.

As yet another example of some of the most fundamental contemporary information/belief
disconnects in the world we currently live in:

In 2010, after merely drinking water from the same glass as a Muslim woman, Asia Bibi, a
Christian, was sentenced to hang by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on charges of
blasphemy. Religiously-disparate societies result in the worst of relationships between entire
nations - war.

Story of One Woman's Unwavering Faith. BroadStreet Publishing Group, LLC.

"Th[e] Act is the Communications Legislation Amendment 6 ((ombatting Misinformation
###### and Disinformation) Act 2023."

It is a bill claimed by its proponents to be aimed against so-called 'misinformation' and
'disinformation'.

The introduction to the bill itself (via link page 2) alerts readers, or claims, that -

"Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety
###### and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy,
society and economy." [whereas new powers under the Act are
intended toward] "balancing freedom of speech."

With no less conviction, the exact opposite may be claimed:

Suppression of so-called `misinformation' and `disinformation'
poses a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as
well as to our democracy, society, scientific advancement and
the economy, and threatens freedom of speech itself.

In other words, the bill reads as being against `alternative views', even if they are merely
perceived as being right or wrong, and therefore reads as being against: open debate; evidence
as distinct from beliefs or agenda, and; the fundamental premise of science, that knowledge
changes iteratively. In other words, and to be blunt about its enormity, it is a bill seemingly
against freedom of speech, freedom of choice, informed consent, democracy, rational debate,
and scientific debate, i.e., a mechanism by which whoever is in power might achieve, wield
and impose dictatorial power.

Page 57 of 63


-----

In practice, according to the Australian Government (via link page 2), the legislation would
enable "the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)" to "monitor" "digital
platforms" and "enforce" "regulation", in instances of compliance deemed "ineffective" by
ACMA, and would "extend to NON*-signatories of the [existing] `VOLUNTARY"

[emphases added] "Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation".

Yet, somehow, seemingly paradoxically given equivalent outcomes may be expected in
practice, (again according to the Australian Government via above link):

"The ACMA will NOT [emphasis added] have the power to request
specific content or posts be removed from digital platform services."

(Text in quotes from: ACMA, 2021, ACMA misinformation report. Fact sheet 1: key research
findings, https://www.acma.,ov.au/report-government-adequacy-digital-platforms-
disinformation-and-news-quality-measures ).

*In other words, this bill would even extend to currently less strictly content-moderated
"alternative social networks — such as Telegram, Gab, Parler and Rumble".

Had such a law existed from long ago, many stark and beneficial changes that we
currently enjoy may never have come about as debate on them may never have been
facilitated:

###### • 'Alternative' women may still be being burnt at the stake for being deemed witches.
 • Women may still not be permitted to represent as members of government.
 • Women may still not be permitted to vote.
 • It may still be regarded that "a woman's place is in the home".
 • Slavery may be ongoing and each well-to-do white household may enjoy the unpaid
services of one or many non-white slaves.

###### • We may still be a "white Australia", with all the racism, against all non-whites, that
that entails.

###### • Aboriginal children may still be being stolen.
 • We may have indefinitely and irreversibly polluted major national lands and waters,
from just another of the world's growing count of nuclear power plant incidents that
are uncontrollable.

###### • Same-sex relationships may still be outlawed.
 • We may not have a multi-party system of government, but instead, rolling
dictatorships - as we would be headed toward if such bills as this are passed.

Page 58 of 63


-----

Further, endorsement of such a bill would be a green light for whoever happens to be in
power to do precisely what the bill itself is somehow intended to avert: not only censor
information that is arbitrarily or deliberately deemed contrary or opposite to that desired or
believed in by the power holder, but to also deliberately and targetedly produce information
favourable to its own ends, including, for example, further erosion of basic human rights, via
manipulated election information.

Differences of opinion drive curiosity, investigation, research, and thereby innovation, which
helps grow economies. The opposite would see such stagnate or wither. If differences of
opinion, belief, evidence, etc., did not exist, we would not need multiple parties in
government, and one party would not be voted out in favour of another for strings of bad,
wrong, and damaging decisions that were based on the likes of what may have been (merely
perceived as) `misinformation' or `disinformation'.

Information is ultimately based upon opinion, belief and attitudes, not facts, evidence nor
reason. Each of these change, with personal life experiences, epiphanies, and updated
understanding of the world around us.

Irrespective of reasonings such as are provided above, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Article 19, states:
"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to
hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through any media and regardless offrontiers."
Source: https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights

Australia was an original signatory to the Human Rights in 1948, soon after World War II.
Indeed, in 1945 Australia was among eight nations that drafted them.
Source: https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/publications/australia-and-univcrsal-

These Rights were compiled specifically in recognition of, and to avert repetition of, many
inhuman atrocities and horrors inflicted upon men, women and children, including crimes
against peace and crimes against humanity, whether during war or other grievous and
injurious circumstances.

"Governments [] committed themselves to establishing the United Nations, with the primary
###### goal of bolstering international peace and preventing conflict. People wanted to ensure that
never again would anyone he unjustly denied life, freedom, food, shelter, and nationality. t he
essence of these emerging human rights principles was captured in President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address when he spoke of a world founded on
###### four essential freedoms: freedom of speech and religion and freedom from want and fear."

Denying such Rights equates to denying the atrocities of war and of rogue states, and denying
the millions of lives lost, including innumerable Australians who have fought against such
entities and fought for or defended such rights.

Attempting to legislate against misinformation and disinformation equates to erasing
democracy itself, since by default doing so effectively advocates for generally unaccepted
alternatives that have caused wars, including propaganda and censorship.

Innovation drives prosperity and development. Innovation, by definition, arises through
alternative ways. Alternative ways stem from alternative views. Views that might be regarded
as 'alternative', irrespective of whether they might for a time be deemed anything from
misguided to suspicious to misinformation to heresy, are a cornerstone of advances in
knowledge, science, medicine and therefore, human society. History is full of examples
where alternative views have yielded ordinary or extraordinary advances, despite for the
period before they became accepted, it being indeterminate as to whether the views actually
had merit, or not.

The potential is to undermine so much that we cherish and that our predecessors lobbied for,
protested for, or fought wars to protect: freedom of speech, informed consent (in relation to
medical interventions, for example), the scientific method, democracy.

###### Appendix 2: Standard of `Proof

Within the Bill, enforcement, to be applied by ACMA, would be in the form of civil penalties.
However, before alleged breaches may be escalated to court, in question is how ACMA
would, or even could, adjudicate practically, fairly and impartially day-to-day. What
###### Standard of Proof could justifiably be applied, by ACMA, in day-to-day operations?

Within Australia's legal framework, two differing standards of proof are applied:

(1) 'on the balance of probabilities' - in civil jurisdictions
(2) `beyond a reasonable doubt' - in criminal ones.

In criminal but not in civil matters in Australia, `presumption of innocence' applies.
Australia's criminal justice system operates on the principle that it is more acceptable to let a
guilty person go free than to convict an innocent individual.

Part 2.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 contains provisions regarding proof
###### of criminal responsibility. In particular, section 13.1 provides that the
prosecution bears a legal burden of proving every element of an offence
relevant to the guilt of the person charged. [] Section 13.2 provides that a
legal burden of proof on the prosecution must be discharged beyond
reasonable doubt.' [emphases added]

However, the standard `beyond reasonable doubt' has many limitations. For one, it demands
that judgments (by judge or jury) are made on the basis that there is no other `reasonable'
(or `logical') explanation. In practice, arriving at judgments in many cases is highly
subjective, contingent on many factors. These include human factors, external pressures, the
cogence of arguments made, and individual interpretations as to what the caveat-connoting
verbs `reasonable' and `logical' equate to.

Further, the presumption of innocence is contained in, and may be removed via instruments in
article 14(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

Under article 4 of the ICCPR, countries may take measures derogating from
certain of their obligations under the Covenant, including the right to the
'presumption of innocence' in time of public emergency which threatens the
life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed.'

###### Report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms' disinformation and news quality measures

ACMA, 2021 Report, Fact sheet 1:

"A small number of celebrities, politicians and prominent
influencers exert an OUTSIZED [emphases added) influence
over COVID-19 narratives in Australia."

Such a statement seems to reveal an apparent belief that somehow weight of numbers, i.e.,
`consensus' as distinct from `minority' stance, matters. And it often may. But that is far from
always being the case. Such belief is unsupportable. Countless examples exist in history
where the `majority'/`mainstream'/`cstablishment' ended up proven wrong, by just a few
individuals, if not just one, (at age 16 Albert Einstein, a nobody, dropped out of school, then
became a somebody), or where (to paraphrase Thomas Huxley), an entrenched hypothesis,
belief, or `dogma', became void with the arrival of a single ugly contrary fact.
