###### Dr Murray May    18 August 2023
 Submission on exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 I submit the following on the above draft Bill, and have strong concerns that it has the potential to silence dissenting views and experts, and act merely to entrench government narratives, which may in themselves constitute misinformation. No one government or agency has a monopoly on truth. Our perception of truth evolves over time with experience.  Thus:

 1. Who decides what constitutes ‘misinformation’/’ disinformation? (Their

 qualifications, experience, ties with industry)

 2. To whom and what products will it apply? 

 3. How will the government determine what

 constitutes‘misinformation’/’disinformation’?

 4. How will the government monitor developments in diverse areas to update its

 understanding of information/disinformation in the future?

 5. How will the government communicate to all Australians (of all ages, ethnicities,

 education levels and abilities) what they can and can’t say in the future?

 I provide two examples of how this Bill could exert a strong censorship role, even embedding out of date misinformation from the government itself in the process. 
 Example 1  ACMA is a statutory body overseeing telecommunications licensing. ACMA personnel are not scientists, academics, researchers or medical professionals. ACMA staff are not qualified to act as arbitrator on the issues of RF/EMR exposures and health. Instead, ACMA defers to ARPANSA, which uses the guidelines of the industry linked non-government body ICNIRP.
 This means that on EMR issues, ACMA by definition subscribes to the view that only thermal effects are relevant for making decisions on electromagnetic radiation and health.  However, there is now a considerable body of scientific opinion and peer reviewed scientific literature on the non-thermal impacts of electromagnetic radiation (both to human health and the environment), including concerns related to 5G. 
 I attach an example paper (Davis et al. Wireless technologies, nonionizing electromagnetic fields and children: Identifying and reducing health risks, Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care 2023; 53:101374), though many have been published in 2023, and the 286 references in the Davis paper show the literature is significant. ARPANSA seeks to ignore or contradict such analysis. Further, I received a reply from the Department of Infrastructure that my communications to the Minister alerting her to newly published literature, will not receive a response. In other words, the Minister and Department apparently want to bury their

###### heads in the sand in relation to the developing paradigm and remain attached to an out of date one.
 The consequences of this approach are no longer academic either. I provide clips from a website below on a US case that asks the Federal Communications Commission to do its homework properly. 
 https://ehtrust.org/press-conference-eht-et-al-v-fcc-landmark-case-on-wireless-5g-safety/

 In an historic decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit judged in favour of environmental health groups and petitioners on Aug. 13, 2021, finding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) violated the Administrative Procedure Act and failed to respond to comments on environmental harm.
 The court ruled that the decision by the FCC to retain its 1996 safety limits for human exposure to wireless radiation was “arbitrary and capricious” and held that the FCC failed to respond to “record evidence that exposure to RF radiation at levels below the Commission’s current limits may cause negative health effects unrelated to cancer.”  
 Further, the agency demonstrated “a complete failure to respond to comments concerning environmental harm caused by RF radiation.” The court found the FCC ignored numerous organisations, scientists and medical doctors who called on them to update limits. Human exposure guidelines for wireless radiation were last set in 1996.  
 The Court found that the FCC did not provide evidence of properly examining evidence such as:

 1. impacts of long-term wireless exposure

 2. impacts on children 

 3. the testimony of persons injured by wireless radiation 

 4. impacts on the developing brain

 5. impacts on the reproductive system

 6. impacts on wildlife and the environment.
 The Court specifically ordered the FCC to provide a reasoned explanation for these issues:

  the impacts of wireless radiation on children

  the health implications of long-term exposure to RF radiation

  the ubiquity of wireless devices and the technological developments since the FCC last

 updated its guidelines. 

  the cell phone radiation emission test methods that use heat measurements and allow a

 space between the phone and body. 

  the impacts of wireless radiation on the environment.

###### Example 2 Information provided by credible scientists and leading physicians demonstrated that mRNA vaccines used during the Covid pandemic were neither safe nor effective, as claimed by the government. Could and would the planned Misinformation Bill be used to censor such information because it brings to light embarrassing information and contradicts the prevailing government narrative? 

 Thus Wiseman et al. (see attached paper) in a submission to the US FDA found that:

 There is inadequate evidence for safety of booster doses amidst mounting concerns for the first two doses: 

  Significant safety concerns need to be addressed for the Covid-19 vaccines as
 presently used, and with the use of booster doses. 

  We show intense safety signals for the Covid-19 vaccines compared with influenza
 vaccines with 176 times the number of deaths/person vaccinated reported in VAERS. 

  To account for any stimulated reporting, compared with H1N1 vaccines where
 stimulated reporting was suspected, this ratio is still high at 35. 

  Although classical disproportionality analysis is inadequate and superseded by
 methods that normalize for actual doses administered or people vaccinated, we nonetheless detected strong age-dependent signals for deaths, serious events coagulopathy and myocardial infarction. 

 More recent published papers have only reinforced the above concerns about vaccine damage considerably above the rate of previous vaccines e.g. J. Fraiman, J. Erviti, M. Jones et al. Serious adverse events of special interest following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in randomized trials in adults. Vaccine 40 (2022) 5798–5805. This paper is attached.

 Another paper from medical experts attached (Bardosh K, et al. BMJ Global Health 2022;7:e008684. doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2022-008684) notes that mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policies used around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase vaccination rates provoked considerable social and political resistance. They suggest this has had unintended harmful consequences and may not be ethical, scientifically justified, and effective. 
 Trust in government has been considerably eroded as adverse and sometimes very serious vaccine damage has been observed in personal networks, in spite of government assurances that mRNA vaccines were “safe and effective”. The AZ vaccine has also been withdrawn for use in Australia because of concerns about clotting effects.

**Summary**

       - There is inadequate evidence for safety of booster doses amidst mounting concerns for first two doses

       - Significant safety concerns need to be addressed for the Covid-19 vaccines as presently used, and with the use of
booster doses.

       - We show intense safety signals for the Covid-19 vaccines compared with influenza vaccines with 176 times the
number of deaths/person vaccinated reported in VAERS.

       - To account for any stimulated reporting, compared with H1N1 vaccines where stimulated reporting was suspected,
this ratio is still high at 35.

       - Although classical disproportionality analysis is inadequate and superseded by methods that normalize for actual
doses administered or people vaccinated, we nonetheless detected strong age-dependent signals for deaths, serios
events coagulopathy and myocardial infarction.

       - We identified three separate pools of vaccine associated deaths, totaling 45,000-147,000 deaths.

          - Non C19 deaths under reported in VAERS 20,400-62,500

          - C19 deaths occulting in vaccinated 25,000-85,000

          - An unknown number of deaths in non-vaccinated contributed by transmission from vaccinated.

          - These figures should be placed in the context of the upper estimate of 140,000 lives saved due to the vaccines
(to May 2021 )(1)

          - The benefits of vaccination should be considered in light of resistant strains, waning immunity(2) and
development of natural immunity(3).

          - Unresolved safety questions for pregnant mothers must be resolved.

       - Products must be regulated as gene therapy products, with appropriate long term follow up for autoimmune
diseases, cancers etc.

       - Significant short and Long term health issues require the **_Recognition_** **_of_** **_short_** **_and_** **_long_** **_term_** **_vaccine_** **_-related_**

**1.** **Introduction:** **Waning** **or** **Reduced** **Effectiveness** **of** **Covid-19** **Vaccines**
Globally1 (9/13/21) around 5.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered, mostly pursuant to Emergency
Use Authorization (USA) or equivalent status. At a recent (8/30/21) meeting of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP), evidence was presented by CDC staff(4) regarding reduced effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines, in
some scenarios as low as 42% for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.(5)

_individuals_ _16_ _years_ _of_ _age_ _and_ _older”_ which is the subject of the discussion at this meeting.2

The purpose of this document is to document concerns that we believe should be considered by VRBPAC in its
deliberations. Our concerns fall into five categories:

**•** **Regulatory:** Which legally distinct product is being discussed and under what regulatory authorization type and
product classification?

**•** **Transparency** **and** **public** **trust:** The issuance of a BLA without a public meeting or comment, apparent withholding
of evidence prior to CDC's ACIP recent vote to recommend the Pfizer vaccine, and announcement of ancillary
safety studies suggest a lack of transparency that erodes trust in public health officials. Such erosion, we suggest,
is a major driver in vaccine hesitancy.

**•** **Safety:** Since there are mounting and unresolved safety concerns for the two-dose regime, and a paucity of data
on the booster dose, how can FDA assure the public of the safety of additional doses?

**•** **Efficacy:** Concerns for bias and sources of confounding

**•** **Policy** **towards** **repurposed** **drugs** must be re-examined due to a change in risk-benefit analysis.

Please note that this document extends our previous comments discussed in written submissions (6,7) for the recent ACIP
meeting of CDC (8/30/21) as well as in an Op-Ed article of a respected clinical trials web site.(8)

**2.** **Regulatory** **Concerns**

**2.1.** **Which** **legally** **distinct** **product** **is** **under** **consideration** **and** **under** **which** **authorization** **type?**

According to the FDA's announcement of this meeting, the topic under discussion is _“the_ _Pfizer-BioNTech_ _supplemental_
_Biologics_ _License_ _Application_ _for_ _COMIRNATY.”_ (footnote 2)

Prior to August 23rd, an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) was in place for a product known as the “Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine” as referred to in a revised EUA letter of May 10.(9)

On August 23rd 2021, in a letter to Pfizer, Inc., FDA disclosed the existence of two legally distinct [footnote 8 in (10)] vaccine
products:

       - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: this product was to remain under EUA.

       - COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)        - a BLA was issued on August 23rd for this product(11) to BioNTech
Manufacturing GmbH.

According to that letter, these two products can be used “interchangeably” but have “certain differences that do not impact
safety or effectiveness”

According to FDA, since the COMIRNATY product, as a practical matter is not available, the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech
product would remain in place. However, as popularly understood, for example in this Reu news e; 3 the _“Pfizer-_
_BioNTech_ _COVID-19_ _vaccine_ _gains_ _full_ _U.S._ _regulatory_ _approval.”_

Accordingly, the announced topic for this meeting

_“the_ _Pfizer-BioNTech_ _supplemental_ _Biologics_ _License_ _Application_ _for_ _COMIRNATY.”_

is at best unclear. The only company of record with a product called COMIRNATY with a BLA to which a supplement could
be added is BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH. Pfizer-BioNTech has a legally distinct product referred to in official documents
(10) as _“Pfizer-BioNTech_ _COVID-19_ _Vaccine.”_

Will the agency clarify:

       - For which legally distinct product is an approval of a booster dose being considered?

       - If FDA intends to supplement BLA approval for booster doses for a product (COMIRNATY) that is not available, but
not authorize their emergency use under an EUA, how can this be of any help whatsoever?

BioNTech product and not for the BioNTech (ie COMIRNATY) product?

       - What are the “certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness” between the EYa and BLA
products?(10)

       - What are the legal ramifications of having two legally distinct products in terms of:

o Operation of different regulatory standards to conduct safety monitoring, reporting of advesrse events, or
adherence to other regulatory requirements?

o Liability of manufacturers or health providers for injuries resulting from the use of vaccines?
o Ability of patients to bring actions under various statues for vaccine-related injuries?
o Ability of patients to obtain compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation (or similar)
Program?4

o Other ramifications?

**2.2.** **Vaccines** **or** **Gene** **Therapy** **Products?** **Regulatory** **and** **Safety** **Consequences**

**2.2.1** **.Regulatory** **Classification**

Although these Covid-19 agents fall under FDA's definition of vaccines and vaccine-associated products,5

_“products,_ _regardless_ _of_ _their_ _composition_ _or_ _method_ _of_ _manufacture,_ _intended_ _to_ _induce_ _or_ _enhance_ _a_ _specific_
_immune_ _response_ _to_ _prevent_ _or_ _treat_ _a_ _disease_ _or_ _condition,_ _or_ _to_ _enhance_ _the_ _activity_ _of_ _other_ _therapeutic_
_interventions._ _”_

they differ significantly from the classical vaccine consisting of an inactivated or attenuated pathogen in two major respects.
Firstly, rather than an immune response being elicited by injected antigen, it is elicited by antigen (the SARS-Cov2 spike
protein), whose within-subject biosynthesis is induced by mRNA or DNA deployed by the vaccine.

Secondly, these vaccines also meet FDA's definition of gene therapy products.6

(emphasis added) _“Human_ _gene_ _therapy/gene_ _transfer_ _is_ **_the_** **_administration_** **_of_** **_nucleic_** **_acids,_** _viruses,_ _or_
_genetically_ _engineered_ _microorganisms_ _that_ _mediate_ _their_ _effect_ _by_ _transcription_ _and/or_ _translation_ _of_ _the_ _transferred_
_genetic_ _material,_ _and/or_ _by_ _integrating_ _into_ _the_ _host_ _genome._ _Cells_ _may_ _be_ _modified_ _in_ _these_ _ways_ _ex_ _vivo_ _for_
_subsequent_ _administration_ _to_ _the_ _recipient,_ _or_ **_altered_** **_in_** **_vivo_** **_by_** **_gene_** **_therapy_** **_products_** **_administered_** **_directly_**
**_to_** **_the_** **_recipient.”_** **_A_** similar expanded definition is given in FDA's Guidance on Long Term Follow-Up After
Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products.(12)

Moderna, Inc., the maker of another mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, acknowledged in their 2Q2020 SEC filing(13)7 thus _"Currently,_
_mRNA_ _is_ _considered_ _a_ _gene_ _therapy_ _product_ _by_ _the_ _FDA.”_ These vaccines might be more appropriately be described as
“Gene Therapy Vaccines” (GTV).

Consistent with the FDA June 2020 guidance(14) on the development of vaccines for Covid-19, Pfi ,8 loderna9 and
Johnson & Johnson,10 declared their intent in their requests for EUA status to follow study subjects for up to 36 months.
Parenthetically, an additional concern has arisen in the unblinding of at least some of the clinical trials, thus preventing full
assessment of safety as previously declared.(15)

Even this 36-month follow-up period is inadequate for two reasons. Firstly, although the sorts of events anticipated by FDA
and CDC are of relatively early onset, the duration or prognosis for a number of them is unknown. Secondly, since these

7 Moderna’s 202020 SEC filing is dated August 6 2020, and states that the phase 1 study began March 16, 2020, with the phase 2
study being fully enrolled by July 8, 2020. Enrollment for the phase 3 study began July 27, 2020, as also reflected in for
clinicaltrials.gov. Each phase would have been cleared by FDA. The start date given in clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer’s trial was April 29
020 and for J&J Sept 7 2020.

autoimmune, hematologic, other disorders or effects on the genome or gene expression, as advised in FDA in its guidance
document “Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy (GT) products.”(12) The length of monitoring
advised by FDA may be (emphasis added) **“as** **_long_** **_as_** **_15_** **_years_** _following_ _exposure_ _to_ _the_ _investigational_ _GT_ _product,_
_specifying_ _that_ _the_ _LTFU_ _observation_ _should_ _include_ _a_ _minimum_ _of_ _five_ _years_ _of_ _annual_ _examinations,_ _followed_ _by_ _ten_ _years_
_of_ _annual_ _queries_ _of_ _study_ _subjects,_ _either_ _in_ _person_ _or_ _by_ _questionnaire.”_

Accordingly, the designation of these vaccines as Gene Therapy products is not merely a semantic nicety; rather it has
regulatory consequences in terms of long term follow up manufacturers should be required to conduct. No reference to
these FDA guidance documents on long term follow up for gene therapy products (12) was made in FDA's guidance on
development of Covid-19 vaccines(14), nor in the EUA briefing documents provided by Pf , Mode a and Jot son &
Ji son

Will FDA provide an explanation as to why the provisions relating to Gene Therapy products have not been incorporated
into the risk-benefit analysis of these vaccines, or the types and durations of studies it has required of these products?

Will FDA explain why the classification of these products as Gene Therapy Products, evinced by Moderna's disclosure in
August 2020, has been all but ignored in terms of the types and durations of studies it has required of these products?

**2.2.2.** **Will** **long** **term** **studies** **and** **cancer** **be** **performed?**

THE BLA for COMIRNATY acknowledges LONG term myocardial issues with a 5 year follow up in a required post-marketing
study consistent with the lower range for LTFU for Gene Therapy Products.

As contemplated in the FDA Gene Therapy Guidance document?(12), there appear to be no plans for FDA or CDC to collect
other long-term data (or require studies) on autoimmune disease, cancer and other disorders This is particularly concerning
as the package insert(16) states that _“COMIRNATY_ _has_ _not_ _been_ _evaluated_ _for_ _the_ _potential_ _to_ _cause_ _carcinogenicity,_
_genotoxicity,_ _or_ _impairment_ _of_ _male_ _fertility.”_ Neither in the in the BLA Approval letter, (11) or Summary Basis for Regulatory
Approval(17) is there a POST MARKETING REQUIREMENT to conduct carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or male fertility.

A number of Covid vaccine surveillance systems operate under the aegis of FDA11 12and/or CDC .12 : lists six follow-up

studies below.

While it is appropriate to conduct these sorts of studies, it is noteworthy that the concerns expressed in the objectives for a
number of these studies are not reflective of the extensive media campaign to promote vaccination and its safety. We will
discuss specific details of some of these studies in the sections below. In our opinion this contravenes the principles of
obtaining informed consent for medical treatment.

conservatively, an annual cost of $500 per person, and based on an estimated (8/29/21)204 million of Americans having
received at least one GTV dose, this amounts to an annual cost of some $102 billion, just for the USA. This figure is
comparable to the 2020 budgets or revenues of NIH ($42b), Pfizer ($42b), Johnson & Johnson ($83b) or Facebook ($86b)
and eclipses estimates of between $25 billion and $35 billion for the global Covid-19 vaccine market. Considering the
approximately 4.5 billion GTV recipients around the world, this annual global cost, before any treatment or indirect costs,
will approach trillions of dollars. Who will absorb this cost? Government? Medicare? Medicaid? The manufacturers of the
Gene Therapy Vaccines? Private insurers? Patients?

**3.** **Transparency** **and** **Public** **Trust** **Concerns**

Much is being made about vaccine hesitancy, particularly that attributed to _“misinformation.”_ Allow us to suggest that the
problem is not unjustified mistrust in the vaccines. It is justified mistrust of public health officials fueled by contraventions of
the best traditions of American democracy such as:

       - FDA's issuance of a BLA without a public meeting or comment.

       - The apparent withholding of evidence of waning immunity prior to CDC's ACIP recent vote to recommend the Pfizer
vaccine.(8)

       - The lack of transparency within NIH regarding the formulation of their treatment guidelines.

       - The effective admission by CDC that the primary driver to issue a full FDA approval for any one of the Covid-19
vaccines, along with a CDC.ACIP recommendation was vaccine hesitancy,(18) rather than the accumulation of
sufficient evidence for safety and efficacy. CDC referenced a survey which asked unvaccinated people:

_“Would_ _you_ _be_ _more_ _likely_ _to_ _get_ _vaccinated_ **_if_** **_one_** _of_ _the_ _vaccines_ _currently_ _authorized_ _for_ _emergency_ _use_ _received_

_more_ _likely_ _to_ _get_ _vaccinated_ _after_ _full_ _FDA_ _vaccine_ _approval,”_ _meaning_ _-_ _OF_ _ANY_ _OF_ _THE_ _VACCINES._

The presentation suggested that: _“Vaccination_ _may_ _be_ _more_ _acceptable_ _to_ _stakeholders_ _under_ _full_ _FDA_ _approval_
_and_ _standard_ _ACIP_ _recommendation._ _”_

Another source of mistrust is the inconsistent use of standards of evidence. The use of observational or non-peer reviewed
(preprinted) studies by proponents of re-purposed drugs has been heavily criticized by public health officials as well as the
media, who have insisted on evidence from large RCTs that have undergone peer review. It was with some wonder that
observational and non-peer reviewed studies were included in one of the key analyses provided to support ACIP's
recommendation. In one analysis (slide 19) from a presentation13 analyzing vaccine efficacy, 17 observational studies,
including 7 non-peer-reviewed, were employed. The presenter concurred with a remark by one of the discussants that there
was close agreement between the observational studies and the RCT. We welcome the example that CDC has set to allow
for these sorts of analyses to inform other decisions relating to the pandemic and public health.

There is also mistrust due to the demonization and censorship of the many medical professionals and scientists who have
raised concerns about these vaccines and have advocated for the use of repurposed drugs. These workers are from across
the political spectrum who are not only proponents of classical type vaccines, but also proponents of gene therapy products

technologies, safety is paramount, and we assert that until proven otherwise, the risk-benefit balance demands a re­
assessment of the justification for the continued use of these Gene Therapy Vaccines (GTVs), especially as booster doses
are now being considered.

In addition to concerns related to the gene therapy nature of these products there are concerns about the toxicology of the
spike protein antigen, the adjuvants themselves as well as downstream consequences at the gene or mRNA level.
Importantly, inexpensive, safe and effective prevention and treatment based on repurposed drugs are readily available. (19)

The contentions that our motivations are rooted elsewhere or that allegedly politically motivated advocacy for use of
repurposed drugs in Covid-19 has spewed misinformation fueling vaccine hesitancy is a perversion of the truth as such
advocacy is subject to heavy censorship within social media, the peer reviewed scientific literature and in professional
contexts. At a time when unity against Covid-19 is sorely needed, this demonization serves to increase divisiveness and
political polarization. This demonization erodes patients' fundamental rights to choose whether or not to undergo any sort
of medical treatment, and erodes physicians' freedom to practice medicine, by prescribing treatments they believe to be in
the best interests of their patients.

Governments, public health agencies and the medical community must address the safety consequences of these vaccines
and at the same time make fundamental corrections to heretofore employed approaches to Covid-19 and the suppression
of legitimate scientific debate.

Can FDA and this committee provide an assurance that it will do everything in its power to defuse the current toxic
atmosphere that is stifling scientific discussion?

**4.** **Ongoing** **and** **Unresolved** **Safety** **Concerns** **for** **Covid-19** **vaccines**

The discussion on booster doses in the August 30 meeting of CDC's ACIP recognized the challenges in producing reliable
data that could support the use of booster doses. It was unclear that there was any significant body of data available to
address either safety of efficacy of booster doses. Limited data on efficacy have now emerged. One recent study(20)
suggested that waning or reduced immunity can be restored with a booster dose, but this is only partial, and is at best,
according to the study, temporary.

Before considering the safety of a third vaccine dose, it is entirely appropriate to discuss the ongoing concerns regarding
the first two doses.

**4.1.** **Safety** **signal** **analysis** **of** **events** **from** **VAERS**

**4.1.1** **.Insensitivity** **of** **Disproportionality** **Signal** **Analysis** **(DSA)** **used** **to** **detect** **safety** **signals**

Several methods have been proposed to detect safety signals related to medical products, specifically from databases of
spontaneous adverse event reports, such as VAERS. In general, these methods do not infer causality, merely they provide
a signal for further investigation. To mitigate a number of statistical and informational challenges, methods involving
Disproportionality Signal Analysis (DSA) have been devised, such as the use of the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) or
other Bayesian or data mining techniques. The VAERS team have indicated that these sorts of methods should be employed
to detect safety signals for the Covid-19 vaccines.(21) Although DSA is a useful tool in pharmacovigilance (PhV) it has
known limitations. A paper authored by scientists from Astra-Zeneca, Pfizer, as well as British and European regulators
stated: _"Thus,_ _the_ _quantitative_ _data_ _in_ _spontaneous_ _reporting_ _systems,_ _while_ _being_ _useful_ _in_ _detecting_ _new_ _signals_ _of_ _drug­_
_event_ _associations,_ _are_ _not_ _easily_ _interpretable_ _in_ _terms_ _of_ _clinical_ _impact"_ _(22)_ The authors further stated _"calculation_ _of_
_PRRs_ _from_ _spontaneous_ _reporting_ _databases_ _should_ _not_ _replace_ _nor_ _delay_ _the_ _performance_ _of_ _formal_ _epidemiological_
_studies,"_

DSA uses the total number of reports reported for a particular drug as a surrogate denominator to estimate the incidence of
a particular event in the population, to be compared with other drugs in the same class. Although methods exist to partially
compensate for masking of a particular event by other events, as well as non-independence of events, the output from these
techniques remains that of a signal which provides no estimate of **epidemiological** **or** **clinical** **impact.** This problem is
compounded in the case of drugs where, even if the number of prescriptions written are known, detail as to actual usage,
dose, length of treatment and so on may not be.

doses are usually fixed, the number of doses given is fixed, with mostly uniform dose intervals. Lastly, the number of doses
administered as well as the number of persons receiving those doses, is known from CDC tracking systems. We note that
presentations made at CDC's ACIP meeting on August 30 largely relied on event incidence rates expressed as the number
of events per 100,000 (or million) doses.

**4.1.2** **.Use** **of** **normalized** **event** **ratios** **for** **signal** **detection**

We adopted the approach published (23) by scientists from FDA and CDC to normalize the number of events reported in
VAERS for the number of people receiving a particular vaccine or doses administered. This figure can be divided by a
similar ratio from a reference vaccine to obtain a normalized event ratio (NER).

We were particularly interested in the H1N1 data, as the paper published by CDC scientists (23) had stated that there had
been active efforts to encourage people to use the VAERS system for H1N1 (see p7251 _“These_ _findings,_ _however,_ _should_
_be_ _interpreted_ _in_ _light_ _of_ _the_ _publicity_ _around_ _the_ _2009-H1N1_ _vaccine_ _and_ _efforts_ _to_ _increase_ _reporting_ _to_ _VAERS”)._

Examining the data in VAERS (7/30/21) obtained using the WONDER portal, the per population- or per dose- normalized
event ratios are very high, particularly for reports of death (177, 98 respectively) (Table 1).

Estimates of PPR are clearly highly muted, challenging their value and appropriateness. Nonetheless, the signal (5.2) for
deaths was significant according to the Evans criteria.(24) To the extent that there was any sort of stimulated reporting, this
was against a background of extensive campaigns promoting the safety of the C19 vaccines.

      - p <0.00001. (chi squared test). Although other values for example for life-threatening or serious conditions do meet the
Evans(24) criteria because they do not exceed 2, the chi-squared test nonetheless yields p<0.00001.

We refined our analysis (Table 2) using VAERS data as of August 6 2021. We considered only reports from the 50 States
plus Washington DC, excluding US territories and “unknown” locations to ensure that only AE's reported from the US were
used when calculating rates based on vaccination coverage in the US. For the flu vaccines, data from the 2015/16, 2016/17,
2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20 were considered. The 2020/21 season was excluded to avoid confounding effects with
Covid-19. For the Covid-19 vaccines, reports with an indication of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 were not included in
counts for COVID-19 vaccines. Because data availability in VAERS is ephemeral, we needed to repeat parts of our earlier
analysis on what was the currently available dataset. In addition to deaths and serious events, we examined three categories
of events noted to be of interest in the VAERS' Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19:(21) Guillan-Barre Syndrome
(GBS), coagulopathy, and acute myocardial infarction.

Table 2 shows strong signals for serious events, death, coagulopathy and myocardial infarction. The signals are more
evident using the Normalized Event Ratio (by dose) than with the PRR. No major differences were evident if the PRR was
calculated by number of unique events or by number of unique reports (i.e. symptoms). The values for Normalized Event
Ratios (by dose) for death and serious events were similar to those from our earlier analysis (Table 1).

For death and coagulopathy, the signals appear to increase with age. The reverse is true for myocardial infarction. For
serious events an age-dependency is not evident. For Guillan-Barre syndrome, the signals appear weak and not detected
at all using the DSA/ PRR method.

We conclude from this portion of our work that:

       - There are strong safety signals evident for death, serious events, coagulopathy and myocardial infarction
associated with the Covid-19 vaccines compared with the flu vaccines.

       - Signals are age dependent for death and coagulopathy (increase with age) and myocardial infarction (decreases
with age).

       - Even after accounting for possible stimulated reporting, by comparison with H1N1 vaccines, strong safety signals
are still evident.

       - Using Normalized Event Ratios, consistent with CDC published methodology (23) appears a far more sensitive
method of identifying signals than DSA/PRR methods.

       - Further investigation is warranted to determine causality.

       - Caution is warranted as booster doses are being considered.

Note: The PRR is the ratio of the proportion of a particular event or event type out of all reports (or events) for COVID-19 to the proportion
of all reports (or events) for the combined 2015-2019 flu seasons. Orange shading indicates a statistically significant difference between
the proportion of COVID-19 proportion of COVID-19 and flu reports for that age group and event type (chi squared test. Flu reporting
rates represent the total reports to VAERS across the 2015/16-2019/20 flu seasons for each age group. Covid-19 reporting rates include
all reports to VAERS for COVID-19 vaccines for each age group as of Aug. 6, 2021. The Normalized Event Ratio shown is calculated
according to the number of doses given.
The “coagulopathy” category includes a set of 26 preferred terms (PT) for thromboembolic events (although the category does not include
coagulopathy PT). The full list of PT’s for GBS, coagulopathy and acute myocardial infarctions can be found in Table 4.6 of the VAERS
SOP document.(21)

explanation17 that includes a comprehensive report of the types and numbers of investigations performed, including
autopsies. Although CDC has provided guidance for the conduct of autopsies of Covid-19 cases, there is no prospective
protocol for the conduct of autopsies to determine whether or not the death is vaccine-related. This would include a detailed
description of the types of histopathological methods to distinguish vaccine-induced spike protein from spike protein derived
from a Covid-19 infection. Where is this analysis? Where is there a protocol? Similarly, the strong signal of heart attacks in
younger than in older people (403 vs. 88, Table 1) must be investigated.

Lastly, it is worth discussing the signal for myocarditis, acknowledged to be an issue as a warning in the COMIRNATY
package insert attests:(16)

_“Postmarketing_ _data_ _demonstrate_ _increased_ _risks_ _ofmyocarditis_ _and_ _pericarditis,_ _particularly_ _within_ 7 _days_ _following_
_the_ _second_ _dose.”_

In

Table 3, we show PRR signals that meet the Evans(24) criteria that are of a similar magnitude (or smaller, except for GBS)
to those shown in Table 2, justifying their further investigation.

Flu seasons from 2015/16      - 2019/20 were used. Covid vaccine reports were through Aug 6 2021. Reports for codes that includes Covid
of SARS-Cov-2 were excluded.

Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA) of the VSD system was unable to detect a safety signal for myocarditis18 until data were age
stratified. Although in theory RCA should be able to detect signals in near real-time as medical records are being generated,
the method appears even less sensitive than those prescribed for VAERS(21) with limitations described above. A paper
was published in JAMA (25) on September 3rd describing the findings from the Rapid Cycle Analysis of the VSD system. It
concluded that:

_“incidence_ _of_ _selected_ _serious_ _outcomes_ _was_ _not_ _significantly_ _higher_ _1_ _to_ _21_ _days_ _postvaccination_ _compared_ _with_
_22_ _to_ _42_ _days_ _postvaccination.”_

_We_ suggest that publication of this paper without the context of the acknowledged myocarditis signals from VAERS, within
the conclusion, is highly misleading.

CDC has acknowledged the many limitations inherent in the VAERS system, including that the system is prone to under­
reporting for a variety of reasons. There is additional confusion given specific reporting requirements pursuant to the EUA.
The CDC web site states19 that under an EUA, health providers are required to report certain categories of events following

event or not.

With about 2/3 of the US population vaccinated, we would expect about 5000 per deaths to occur every day from non-
Covid-19 causes. Using a conservative 30-day follow up, we would expect to see 150,000 deaths reported in VAERS. As
of 8/29/21, 6128 deaths (USA, territories and unknown) have been reported in connection with Covid-19 vaccines (4805
deaths 50 States and Washington DC). The system does not appear to be functioning as designed.

In CDC's recent ACIP meeting a number of the presentations referenced data from VAERS without expressing concern that
there had been any sort of over- or stimulated reporting. Indeed, the point was made in one presentation,20 that for

myocarditis/ pericarditis at least, the VAERS and VSD agreed closely.

**Data** **presented** **at** **Aug** **30.2021** **ACIP** **Meeting**

One of the discussants (Dr. Su?) opined that VAERS had captured a substantial portion of these types of reports.

CDC scientists published (26) a method to estimate the degree of under-reporting in VAERS, by comparing the rates of
AEs published in clinical trials, with rates normalized for population found in VAERS.

We used the 3 deaths classified as adverse events in Table S3 of the 6 month follow up study for the Pfizer vaccine (27).
Conservatively, we did not use the 15 deaths in Table S4 there. Note the discrepancy between total deaths in the Thomas
paper (18 vs 19 deaths in vaccine vs. placebo) and in the Summary Basis for Regulatory Action(17) where the total number
of deaths reported are 21 and 17 for the vaccine and placebo groups respectively

Using these conservative data, we estimated the numbers of deaths tentatively associated with the Pfizer vaccine may be
4.9-15 times higher than reported. Applied to all vaccines, using the figure of 4805 deaths (50 states. DC) but subtracting
deaths where Covid-19 or SARS is mentioned (639) this may represent a true report rate of between 20,400-62,500 deaths.
The number of life-threatening events may be 24-64 times higher than reported. Noe that this estimate does not infer
causality.

**4.3.** **Estimate** **of** **number** **of** **deaths** **possibly** **associated** **with** **Covid-19** **vaccines**

We have so far estimated 20,400-62,500 deaths unrelated to Covid-19, that we might have expected to find in VAERS (50
States+DC). These non-Covid-related deaths may be related to the toxicity of the spike protein towards heart cells and
effects on coagulation. We now estimate deaths related to Covid-19 subsequent to vaccination.

Dagan et al. in NEJM (28), one of us (HS) observed an early (<7 days) uptick in Covid-19 cases following vaccination.

Combining data in Dagan et al., with statistics from the Israeli Ministry of Health, an increase in the number of deaths in
vaccinated subjects could be found following vaccination. These Israeli data are particularly informative because by the cut­
offdate, 54% of adult Israelis had been vaccinated, mitigating to some degree biases due to early vaccination of those most
at risk. Further, by combining these data sources, we can see what is happening **among** **vaccinated** **patients.** There are
a number of limitations as to causality and potential time biases, but this analysis suggests that there may be 121-413
excess deaths/million associated with vaccination, in those vaccinated (>= 1 dose), equating to about 25,000-85,000 deaths
in the USA. Again, we cannot ascribe cause, merely association. The recent finding from a large Israeli cohort of an
increased (40%) risk of Herpes zoster infection(29) may indicate immunosuppression related to vaccination in some
subjects. In one study naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% Cl, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection
with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected.(3)

**4.3.2** **.Deaths** **in** **the** **unvaccinated** **population** **resulting** **from** **transmission** **by** **the** **vaccinated**

There is a third pool of deaths and Covid-19 cases that must be considered in assessing the risk and benefits of the Covid-
19 vaccines. Contrary to initial hopes, vaccines may not reduce transmission.(30), thus Covid-19 may have been unwittingly
transmitted by vaccinees to the non-vaccinated.(31,32) including by fecal aerosol(33) in subjects sharing bathrooms.

to obtain the commitment from BioNTech to conduct a post-marketing pregnancy/neonatal study with a four-year term.

_Study_ _C4591022,_ _entitled_ _“Pfizer-BioNTech_ _COVID-19_ _Vaccine_ _Exposure_ _during_ _Pregnancy:_ _A_ _Non-Interventional_
_Post-Approval_ _Safety_ _Study_ _of_ _Pregnancy_ _and_ _Infant_ _Outcomes_ _in_ _the_ _Organization_ _of_ _Teratology_ _Information_
_Specialists_ _(OTIS)/MotherToBaby_ _Pregnancy_ _Registry.”_

Note the word commitment. As FDA explains23

“Postmarketing _commitments_ (PMCs) are studies or clinical trials that a sponsor has agreed to conduct, but that
are _not_ _required_ by a statute or regulation.”

This is not a requirement (as for some of the other post marketing studies on myocarditis for example). Compare not only
this level of regulation, but also the length and scope of the study in question with an u e Janssen (J&J) biologic
product for which a 7-year24 study is required and which includes examining effects on child and early development. A
recently approved (2021) Astra-Zeneca biologic product25 requires a NINE-year study on pregnancy and maternal and
fetal/neonatal outcomes.

What is disturbing about this situation is that it is in stark contrast to the language in a CDC study protocol
entitled: “COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Evaluation in Pregnant Women and their Infants”26 and dated June 29 2021:

_“Now_ _that_ _COVID-19_ _vaccines_ _are_ _in_ _use_ _in_ _the_ _U.S.,_ _and_ _pregnancy_ _is_ _not_ _a_ _contraindication,_ _there_ _is_ _an_ _urgent_ _need_ _to_
_monitor_ _the_ _safety_ _of_ _these_ _vaccines_ _when_ _administered_ _during_ _or_ _around_ _the_ _time_ _of_ _pregnancy.”_

The protocol, nonetheless states that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology "broadly supports that COVID-

19 vaccines be available for use in pregnant women and that pregnant women not be denied vaccination."

Similar language appears in a related CDC protocol entitled “COVID-19 Vaccine Safety, Spontaneous abortion (SAB) and
Stillbirth in the Vaccine Safety”27 and dated April 28 2021:

_“Nevertheless,_ _there_ _is_ _an_ _urgent_ _need_ _for_ _data_ _to_ _inform_ _pregnant_ _women_ _and_ _their_ _providers_ _deciding_ _whether_ _to_ _receive_
_a_ _COVID-19_ _vaccine_ _during_ _pregnancy_ _or_ _following_ _an_ _inadvertent_ _exposure._ _”_

Are pregnant women being advised about this sort of language and that they are in effect unknowingly participating in a
clinical study?

Preliminary findings of a CDC study(34) published in June involving 35,691 pregnant v-safe surveillance system participants
and 3958 participants of enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry (only 827 of whom had a completed pregnancy), _“did_ _not_
_show_ _obvious_ _safety_ _signals_ _among_ _pregnant_ _persons_ _who_ _received_ _mRNA_ _Covid-19_ _vaccines._ _”_ The study acknowledged
that _“more_ _longitudinal_ _follow-up,_ _including_ _follow-up_ _of_ _large_ _numbers_ _of_ _women_ _vaccinated_ _earlier_ _in_ _pregnancy,_ _is_
_necessary_ _to_ _inform_ _maternal,_ _pregnancy,_ _and_ _infant_ _outcomes.”._ This study was updated(35) and declared a cumulative
early pregnancy loss rate of 14%. This rate is significantly higher than the published rate for equivalent gestation (more than
6 weeks with dating confirmation of pregnancy) seen(36) of 9% and more recently of 5%.(37) In the same study over 80%
of participants were not surveyed and the fetal loss rate of 14% was reported to be potentially higher due to missing data,
perhaps reaching 18%. No data has been provided for pregnancies beyond 20 weeks in the later publication and requests
for data sharing have been declined by the CDC despite being a publicly funded registry comprising voluntary unpaid
participants.

It is also noteworthy that the only study of efficacy of the mRNA vaccine in pregnant women was recently published (38)and
failed to show any significant differences in overall hospitalization rates (marginal), severe disease or death in a comparison

participants equally distributed between groups. At a published rate of covid death in the pregnant age population of 1 per
100,00028 in fact would require a study of 1.6m people to detect a 50% reduction in mortality. This has not been shown
and therefore no claims as to the efficacy of an original strain -specific mRNA vaccine specific against delta SARS-Cov-2
in pregnancy can be reliably made. Given the potential for the unknown teratogenicity involved in this novel therapy it is not
possible to make any accurate claims of a positive risk-benefit profile in pregnancy despite overwhelming claims of such by
the international OBGYN community.

As with two other related studies (28,29), this study permitted matched control subjects to become vaccinated. A data re-
analysis(39) of one of these studies(28) found that that the entire apparent reduction in Covid-19 deaths, attributed to a two-
dose vaccine, might instead be entirely due to selection bias occurring due to data censoring when either one of matched
pair of subjects was removed from the analysis due to death, or, in the case of control subjects, become vaccinated. A
similar bias is likely to operate in this pregnancy study.

**4.4.2** **.Menstrual** **disorders**

On the very same day (August 30) CDC staff were providing evidence to ACIP on the safety of the Pfizer vaccine, NIH
made the startling announcement2928that it was funding studies _“to_ _explore_ _potential_ _links_ _between_ _COVID-19_ _vaccination_
_and_ _menstrual_ _changes.”_ They elaborated: _“Some_ _women_ _have_ _reported_ _experiencing_ _irregular_ _or_ _missing_ _menstrual_
_periods,_ _bleeding_ _that_ _is_ _heavier_ _than_ _usual,_ _and_ _other_ _menstrual_ _changes_ _after_ _receiving_ _COVID-19_ _vaccines.”_

Querying VAERS (9/3/21) for various menstrual disorders30 we found that for reports associated with the Covid-19 vaccines
there were 7037 separate menstrual disorder related symptoms described in 4783 unique reports. By comparison with all
other vaccines, for ALL years COMBINED we found 897 symptoms in 798 unique events. Most of these are accounted for
by the HPV vaccines (698 symptoms in 623 events) with seasonal flu vaccines contributing only 47 symptoms within 45
unique events. Another analysis of VAERS reports also detected menstrual disorders. (40) A similar pattern of symptoms
relating to menstrual irregularity was seen in the MHRA yellow card reporting scheme in the UK suggesting that this is not
just unique to VAERS reporting.31

One explanation for these irregularities is the biodistribution of the LNP based formula which has been shown to be
preferentially distributed to, and accumulate in, the ovaries in female animal studies. The full biodistribution data for the LNP
component of the Pfizer vaccine from animal studies is now in the public domain following freedom of information requests
(41). The biodistribution studies show clearly that although the LNP vector is partially cleared from the injection site at 48
hours it accumulates over 100-fold in the ovaries during the same time period (p45).

No suitable fertility studies were subsequently performed prior to approval of the therapy to ascertain whether this could
have an impact in humans and the information regarding accumulation of the product was not made public. Only one animal
study addressing the fertility question was assessed prior to the issuance of the EUA which was study 20256434 (p55-56).
This included only 22 rats and in each treatment group and within which one female in each group was euthanized due to
total litter death. No long term studies of the pups was made as all pups were euthanized. An increased pre-implantation
loss rate in rats was noted but no further studies performed.

“Menstrual disorders” are far too often trivialized, leaving its victims and their families to suffer. A number of these disorders
lead to early hysterectomies which trigger another set of complications that can include adhesions, pain, bowel obstruction,
heart disease and dementia. Will these sorts of problems be examined as part of the NIH studies?

is not our prime suspect. Effects on the ovaries and uterus are, and we must view these reported menstrual changes in the
context of unresolved questions about the safety of the vaccines on the reproductive system in general, and on pregnancy
in particular.

**4.5.** **AE** **events** **reported** **elsewhere**

In the United Kingdom, the Yellow Card system(42) for the period 4th January 2021 to 7th July 2021 shows 1,470 deaths
and 1,059,307 adverse events (317,025 individual reports) associated with Covid-19 vaccines. European data are
available through the EudraVigilance System,32 from which we estimate the number of deaths associated with the Pfizer,
Moderna, J&J and Astra-Zeneca vaccines, combined to be between approximately 3537 and 18926 (2021, to 7/17/21).33
The WHO provides the Vigiaccess34 database from which 8,703 deaths and 1,537,994 ADR records were registered
as at 26th July 2021.35

**4.6.** **Establishment** **of** **LTFU** **program:** **pCoVS**

The growing list of short-term effects attributed to the Covid-19 vaccines, as well as unresolved long term concerns poses
a major public health issue. To concretize recognition of, and to spur action to avert and confront this potential public health
crisis, we propose the term:

**Post** **Covid** **Vaccine** **Syndrome** **-** **pCoVS**

_A_ _syndrome_ _occurring_ _after_ _injection_ _of_ _antigen-inducing,_ _gene_ _therapy_ _vaccines_ _to_ _SARS-Cov-2_ _virus._ _The_ _syndrome_ _is_
_currently_ _understood_ _to_ _manifest_ _variously_ _as_ _cardiac,_ _vascular,_ _hematological,_ _musculoskeletal,_ _intestinal,_ _respiratory_ _or_
_neurologic_ _symptoms_ _of_ _unknown_ _long-term_ _significance,_ _in_ _addition_ _to_ _effects_ _on_ _gestation._ _Manifestations_ _of_ _the_ _syndrome_
_may_ _be_ _mediated_ _by_ _the_ _spike_ _protein_ _antigen_ _induced_ _by_ _the_ _delivered_ _nucleic_ _acids,_ _the_ _nucleic_ _acids_ _themselves,_ _or_
_vaccine_ _adjuvants._ _As_ _more_ _data_ _become_ _available,_ _subsets_ _and_ _longer-term_ _consequences_ _of_ _pCoVS_ _may_ _become_
_apparent,_ _requiring_ _revision_ _of_ _this_ _definition._ _Sub-categories_ _may_ _be_ _designated_ _by_ _suffix_ _for_ _example:_

_-_ _C_ _Cardiac_

_-_ _N_ _Neurologoc_

_-_ _H_ _Hematologic_

               - V _Vascular_

_We_ propose:

       - Recognition by public health agencies, governments and professional societies of pCoVS.

       - Assignment of ICD10 and related tracking or re-imbursement codes for pCoVS.

       - Establishment of transparent systems to monitor and track for long-term and delayed pCoVS.

       - Establishment of funding for research into the prevention and treatment of pCoVS.

       - Regulation of the Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines (GTVs) as Gene Therapy products.

       - Insistence on long term (15 years) pharmacovigilance by manufacturers of AI-GTVs for pCoVS consistent with FDA
guidelines for gene therapy products.

       - Legislation to prevent discrimination of patients based on vaccination36 or actual or potential pCoVS status.

       - Establishment of funding to determine what effects if any the GTVs have on the genome or gene expression,
including their effects on toxicity and other disorders. Develop and implement methods to screen for, and treat the
consequences of, such genetic changes.

valuable control population enabling the effects of vaccines to be more fully evaluated.

good health practices, proper use of nutritional supplements and conduct of well-executed clinical trials to examine
the effects of promising repurposed rugs.

**5.** **Efficacy** **and** **Risk-Benefit**

Although a number of studies are beginning to emerge regarding vaccine efficacy, the major decisions regarding FDA
approval and CDC recommendation for the Pfizer vaccine have been based on two studies:

       - Pfizer's own study (-40,000) presented at CDC37 and recently preprinted.(27), with a data cut-off of March 2021.

       - The large Israeli Clalit efficacy (-1.2 million) (28) and related safety (-1.7 million) studies.(29)

There are significant sources of bias in the two Israeli studies. Both studies exclude certain high-risk categories of subjects.
A data re-analysis of the efficacy study (39) found that that the entire apparent reduction in Covid-19 deaths, attributed to a
two-dose vaccine, might instead be entirely due to selection bias occurring due to data censoring when either one of a
matched pairof subjects was removed from the analysis due to death, or, in the case of control subjects, become vaccinated.
Although the original authors recognized this issue and showed in a sensitivity analysis a reduction in crude efficacy from
about 72% to 49%, accounting for censoring that could have occurred over the entire study period could have attenuated
the efficacy estimates significantly. Other biases were detected. Due to similar kinds of matching employed in the related
safety study (29), a similar censoring bias appears to exist.

**6.** **Repurposed** **Drugs**
Once vaccine effectiveness falls from the 90-95% range towards and below 50% any risk-benefit analysis would change
greatly, placing these vaccines in close competition with repurposed drugs with far fewer safety concerns, and
effectiveness under different scenarios of 30-60% [hydroxychloroquine;(43-45) ivermectin;(46,47) fluvoxamine;(48)
ZincA/itamin D/other Vitamins(49,50) ]. Options are running out as we consider authorizing a booster dose. At the same
time Pfizer have announced that the first patient in their phase 2/3 study received a dose of their proprietary PF-
07321332      - a drug intended to treat _“non-hospitalized,_ _symptomatic_ _adult_ _participants_ _who_ _have_ _a_ _confirmed_ _diagnosis_
_of_ _SARSCoV-2_ _infection_ _and_ _are_ _not_ _at_ _increased_ _risk_ _ofprogressing_ _to_ _severe_ _illness,_ _which_ _may_ _lead_ _to_ _hospitalization_
_or_ _death.”(51)_ Will we need to wait another year for the arrival of PF-07321332 when a critical evaluation of the data for
HCQ and IVM, as we have done, has revealed significant flaws in key studies(45,46) that have shaped policy on these
drugs. Not only have we detected key flaws, but once corrected, impressive efficacy estimates are obtained justifying
further study.

**ABSTRACT**
Vaccination policies have shifted dramatically during
COVID-­19 with the rapid emergence of population-­wide
vaccine mandates, domestic vaccine passports and
differential restrictions based on vaccination status. While
these policies have prompted ethical, scientific, practical,
legal and political debate, there has been limited evaluation
of their potential unintended consequences. Here, we
outline a comprehensive set of hypotheses for why these
policies may ultimately be counterproductive and harmful.
Our framework considers four domains: (1) behavioural
psychology, (2) politics and law, (3) socioeconomics,
and (4) the integrity of science and public health. While
current vaccines appear to have had a significant impact
on decreasing COVID-­19-­related morbidity and mortality
burdens, we argue that current mandatory vaccine policies
are scientifically questionable and are likely to cause more
societal harm than good. Restricting people’s access to
work, education, public transport and social life based on
COVID-­19 vaccination status impinges on human rights,
promotes stigma and social polarisation, and adversely
affects health and well-­being. Current policies may
lead to a widening of health and economic inequalities,
detrimental long-­term impacts on trust in government
and scientific institutions, and reduce the uptake of future
public health measures, including COVID-­19 vaccines as
well as routine immunisations. Mandating vaccination is
one of the most powerful interventions in public health
and should be used sparingly and carefully to uphold
ethical norms and trust in institutions. We argue that
current COVID-­19 vaccine policies should be re-­evaluated
in light of the negative consequences that we outline.
Leveraging empowering strategies based on trust and
public consultation, and improving healthcare services and
infrastructure, represent a more sustainable approach to
optimising COVID-­19 vaccination programmes and, more
broadly, the health and well-­being of the public.

**INTRODUCTION**
Since 2021, mandatory proof-­of-­vaccination
policies have been implemented and justified
by governments and the scientific community

metrics in lifting lockdowns and other restrictions (eg,
Australia, Canada and New Zealand); differential access
to medical insurance and healthcare (eg, Singapore);
and mandatory population-­wide vaccination with taxes,
fines, and imprisonment for the unvaccinated (eg, the
Philippines, Austria, Greece) (see table 1).
The publicly communicated rationale for implementing such policies has shifted over time. Early
messaging around COVID-­19 vaccination as a public
health response measure focused on protecting the most
vulnerable. This quickly shifted to vaccination thresholds
to reach herd immunity and ‘end the pandemic’ and
‘get back to normal’ once sufficient vaccine supply was
available.[1 2] In late summer of 2021, this pivoted again
to a universal vaccination recommendation to reduce
hospital/intensive care unit (ICU) burden in Europe
and North America, to address the ‘pandemic of the
unvaccinated’.
COVID-­19 vaccines have represented a critical intervention during the pandemic given consistent data
of vaccine effectiveness averting COVID-­19-­related
morbidity and mortality.[3–6] However, the scientific rationale for blanket mandatory vaccine policies has been
increasingly challenged due to waning sterilising immunity and emerging variants of concern.[7] A growing body
of evidence shows significant waning effectiveness against
infection (and transmission) at 12–16 weeks, with both
Delta and Omicron variants,[8–13] including with third-­dose
shots.[14 15] Since early reports of post-­vaccination transmission in mid-­2021, it has become clear that vaccinated
and unvaccinated individuals, once infected, transmit to


others at similar rates.[16] Vaccine effectiveness may also
be lower in younger age groups.[17] While higher rates of
hospitalisation and COVID-­19-­associated morbidity and
mortality can indeed be observed among the unvaccinated across all age groups,[3–6] broad-­stroke passport
and mandate policies do not seem to recognise the
extreme risk differential across populations (benefits are
greatest in older adults), are often justified on the basis
of reducing transmission and, in many countries, ignore
the protective role of prior infection.[18 19]

Mandate and passport policies have provoked community and political resistance including energetic mass
street protests.[20 21] Much of the media and civil debates
in liberal democracies have framed this as a consequence
of ‘anti-­science’ and ‘right-­wing’ forces, repeating
simplistic narratives about complex public perceptions
and responses. While vaccine mandates for other diseases
exist in some settings (eg, schools, travel (eg, yellow
fever) and, in some instances, for healthcare workers
(HCWs)),[22] population-­wide adult mandates, passports,
and segregated restrictions are unprecedented and have
never before been implemented on this scale. These
vaccine policies have largely been framed as offering
‘benefits’ (freedoms) for those with a full COVID-­19
vaccination series,[23 24] but a sizeable proportion of people
view conditioning access to health, work, travel and social
activities on COVID-­19 vaccination status as inherently
punitive, discriminatory and coercive.[20 21 25–28] There are
also worrying signs that current vaccine policies, rather
than being science-­based, are being driven by sociopolitical attitudes that reinforce segregation, stigmatisation

health.


and polarisation, further eroding the social contract
in many countries. Evaluating the potential societal
harms of COVID-­19 pandemic restrictions is essential to
ensuring that public health and pandemic policy is effective, proportionate, equitable and legally justified.[29 30]
The complexity of public responses to these new vaccine
policies, implemented within the unique sociopolitical
context of the pandemic, demands assessment.
In this paper, we reflect on current COVID-­19 vaccine
policies and outline a comprehensive set of hypotheses for why they may have far-­reaching unintended
consequences that prove to be both counterproductive
and damaging to public health, especially within some
sociodemographic groups. Our framework considers
four domains: (1) behavioural psychology, (2) politics
and law, (3) socioeconomics, and (4) the integrity of
science and public health (see figure 1). Our aim is not
to provide a comprehensive overview or to fully recapitulate the broad ethical and legal arguments against (or
for) COVID-­19 vaccine mandates and passports. These
have been comprehensively discussed by others.[31–33] A
full review of the contribution of mandates and passports
to COVID-­19 morbidity and mortality reductions is not
yet possible, although some existing studies on vaccine
uptake are cited below. Rather, our aim is to add to these
existing arguments by outlining an interdisciplinary
social science framework for how researchers, policymakers, civil society groups and public health authorities can approach the issue of unintended social harm
from these policies, including on public trust, vaccine
confidence, political polarisation, human rights, inequities and social well-­being. We believe this perspective is
urgently needed to inform current and future pandemic
policies. Mandatory population-­wide vaccine policies
have become a normative part of pandemic governance


and biosecurity response in many countries. We question
whether this has come at the expense of local community
and risk group adaptations based on deliberative democratic engagement and non-­discriminatory, trust-­based
public health approaches.

**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES?**
**Reactance, entrenchment and vaccine uptake**
Apart from mandatory vaccination of the elderly (planned
in Czech Republic, Greece, Malaysia and Russia), most
policies do not specify individuals at higher risk of severe
COVID-­19 outcomes–among whom COVID-­19 vaccine
uptake rates, and vaccine confidence, are very high.[34 35]

Although studies suggest that current policies are likely
to increase population-­level vaccination rates to some
degree,[36–39] gains were largest in those under 30 years
old (a very low-­risk group) and in countries with below
average uptake.[36] Moreover, insights from behavioural
psychology suggest that these policies are likely to
entrench distrust and provoke _reactance—a motivation_
to counter an unreasonable threat to one’s freedom.
Literature reviewed by Drury _et al,[40] including a survey_
by Porat et al[41] in the UK and Israel, found that compulsory COVID-­19 vaccination would likely increase levels
of anger, especially in those who are already mistrustful
of authorities, and do little to persuade the already
reluctant. Two experiments in Germany and the USA
found that a new COVID-­19 vaccine mandate would
likely energise anti-­vaccination activism, reduce compliance with other public health measures, and decrease
acceptance to future voluntary influenza or varicella
(chickenpox) vaccines.[42 43] A third experiment found
that selective mandates increased reactance when herd
immunity targets were not clearly explained[44]—which


-----

most governments failed to communicate adequately
and convincingly as they shifted their rationale from
herd immunity to hospital/ICU admission metrics. De
Figueiredo et al[45] found that vaccine passports in the UK
would induce a net _decrease in inclination to get vacci-_
nated among those who had not received a full vaccination dose, while Bell et al[46] found that UK HCWs who
felt pressured to get vaccinated were more likely to have
declined the COVID-­19 vaccine. Jørgensen et al[47] found
that the reintroduction of vaccine passports in late 2021
in Denmark increased distrust among the unvaccinated.
Finally, recent evidence from France suggests that the
_passe sanitaire was associated with increased vaccination_
but that it did so to a lower extent among the most vulnerable, may have contributed to increased nocebo effects
and did not reduce vaccine hesitancy itself; the authors
concluded: “Mandatory vaccination for COVID-­19 runs
the risk of politicising vaccination further and reinforcing
distrust of vaccines.”[48]

**Cognitive dissonance**
The public interpretation of these policies has occurred
within the context of the rapidly changing pandemic.
Oftentimes, public announcements and media coverage
have oversimplified, struggled to communicate potential
adverse events (including a potentially higher risk in the
convalescent)[49] and overstated vaccine efficacy on transmission. Significant public concerns about safety signals
and pharmacovigilance have been furthered by the lack
of full transparency in COVID-­19 clinical trial data[50 51]
as well as shifting data on adverse effects, such as blood-­
clotting events,[52] myocarditis[53] and altered menstrual
periods.[54] These changes have been associated with
changes to vaccination guidelines in terms of eligibility
for different vaccines in some countries. Mandates, passports and segregated restrictions create an environment
where reactance effects are enhanced because people
with low vaccine confidence see contradictory information as validating their suspicions and concerns. The
pressure to vaccinate and the consequences of refusal
heighten people’s scrutiny of information and demand
for clarity and transparency. Current policies have likely
facilitated various layers of cognitive dissonance—a psychological stress precipitated by the perception of contradictory information.
Citing the potential for backlash and resistance, in
December 2020, the director of the WHO’s immunisation
department stated: “I don’t think we envision any countries creating a mandate for [COVID-­19] vaccination.”[55]
Many governments originally followed with similar public
statements, only to shift positions, often suddenly, in
mid or late 2021 during the Delta or Omicron surge,
including in Austria (the first country to announce a
full population-­wide mandate).[56 57] Cognitive dissonance
may have been compounded by the changing rationale
provided for vaccine mandate policies, which originally
focused on achieving herd immunity to stop viral transmission and included public messaging that vaccinated


people could not get or spread COVID-­19. Policies often
lacked clear communication, justification and transparency, contributing to persistent ambiguities and public
concerns about their rationale and proportionality.[58] In
late 2021, however, the re-­introduction of onerous non-­
pharmaceutical interventions in countries with mandates
and passports perpetuated cognitive dissonance, since
governments had made promises that vaccination would
ensure a ‘return to normal’ and many people (especially younger people) had vaccinated based on these
announcements.[36 48]

When mandate rules are perceived to lack a strong
scientific basis, the likelihood for public scrutiny and
long-­term damage to trust in scientific institutions and
regulatory bodies is much higher. A good example is
the lack of recognition of infection-­derived immunity in
employer-­based vaccine mandates and passports in North
America, including most universities and colleges.[59]
Despite clear evidence that infection-­derived immunity provides significant protection from severe disease
on par with vaccination,[18 31] prior infection status has
consistently been underplayed. Many individuals with
post-­infection immunity have been suspended or fired
from their jobs (or pushed to leave) or been unable to
travel or participate in society[31 56–59] while transmission
continued among vaccinated individuals in the workplace. This inconsistency was widely covered in American
conservative and libertarian-­leaning media in ways that
reinforced distrust not only about the scientific basis of
vaccine policies but also the entire public health establishment, including the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).

**Stigma as a public health strategy**
Since 2021, public and political discourse has normalised
stigma against people who remain unvaccinated, often
woven into the tone and framing of media articles.[60]
Political leaders singled out the unvaccinated, blaming
them for: the continuation of the pandemic; stress
on hospital capacity; the emergence of new variants;
driving transmission to vaccinated individuals; and the
necessity of ongoing lockdowns, masks, school closures
and other restrictive measures (see table 2). Political
rhetoric descended into moralising, scapegoating, and
blaming using pejorative terms and actively promoting
stigma and discrimination as tools to increase vaccination. This became socially acceptable among pro-­vaccine
groups, the media and the public at large, who viewed
full vaccination as a moral obligation and part of the
social contract.[61] The effect, however, has been to further
polarise society—physically and psychologically—with
limited discussion of specific strategies to increase uptake
especially in communities where there would be disproportionately larger individual and societal benefits. There
is rarely a discussion of who and why people remain unvaccinated. Vaccine policy appears to have driven social attitudes towards an us/them dynamic rather than adaptive
strategies for different communities and risk groups.

**Table 2** Political rhetoric regarding the unvaccinated


Justin Trudeau, PM “When people are seeing cancer treatments and elective surgeries put off because beds are filled with
of Canada people who chose not to get vaccinated, they’re frustrated…When people see that we are in lockdowns
or serious public health restrictions right now because of the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated
people, people get angry.”
“They are extremists who don’t believe in science, they’re often misogynists, also often racists…It’s a
small group that muscles in, and we have to make a choice, as a leader and as a country: Do we tolerate
these people?”[137]

Joe Biden, “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it’s caused by the fact that despite America having an
President of the unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free
USA vaccines have been available in 80 000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who

have failed to get the shot.”[138]

"For the unvaccinated, you’re looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your
families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.”[139]

Naftali Bennett, PM “Dear citizens, those who refuse vaccines are endangering their health, those around them and the
of Israel freedom of every Israeli citizen. They are endangering our freedom to work, the freedom of our children
to learn and the freedom to hold celebrations with the family. Those who refuse vaccines hurt us all
because if all of us were vaccinated, we would all be able to maintain daily life. But if one million Israelis
continue to not get vaccinated, this will oblige the eight million others to shut themselves in their
homes.”[140]

Michael Gunner, "If you are anti-­mandate, you are absolutely anti-­vax, I don't care what your personal vaccination status
Northern Territories is. If you support, champion, give a green light, give comfort to [or] support anybody who argues against
Chief Minister, the vaccine, you are an anti-­vaxxer, absolutely. Your personal vaccination status is not relevant. If you
Australia campaign against the mandate…If you say 'pro-­persuasion', stuff it, shove it. You are anti-­vax.”[141]


Leveraging stigma as a public health strategy, regardless of whether or not individuals are opposed to
vaccines, is likely to be ineffective at promoting vaccine
uptake.[62] Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals often have concerns that are based in some
form of evidence (eg, prior COVID-­19 infection, data
on age-­based risk, historical/current trust issues with
public health and governments, including structural
racism), personal experiences (eg, direct or indirect
experience of adverse drug reactions or iatrogenic
injuries, unrelated trauma, issues with access to care
to address adverse events, etc) and concerns about the
democratic process (eg, belief that governments have
abused their power by invoking a constant state of emergency, eschewing public consultation and over-­relying


on pharmaceutical company-­produced data) that may
prevent or delay vaccination.[45 46 63–66] Inflammatory rhetoric runs against the pre-­pandemic societal consensus
that health behaviours (including those linked to known
risk factors for severe COVID-­19, for example, smoking
and obesity) do not impact the way medical, cultural or
legal institutions treat individuals seeking care. Some
governments discussed or imposed medical insurance
fines or premiums on the unvaccinated, while hospital
administrators considered using vaccination status as a
triage protocol criterion. The American Medical Association released a statement decrying the refusal to treat
unvaccinated patients[67] but this has not prevented the
ongoing narrative of shaming and scapegoating people
choosing not to get vaccinated.


-----

**Trust, power and conspiracy theories**
Trust is one of the most important predictors of vaccine
acceptance globally[68 ] 69 including confidence in
COVID-­19 vaccines.[63 70 71] Data show that being transparent about negative vaccine information increases trust
and Petersen _et al[72] found that when health authorities_
are not transparent, it can increase receptivity to alternate explanations.
COVID-­19 vaccine policies have the potential to erode
vaccine confidence, trust and the social contract in the
particular context of the pandemic, which has exacerbated social anxieties, frustrations, anger and uncertainty. By the time COVID-­19 vaccine mandates were
introduced, many communities had struggled under
lockdowns and other severe public health restrictions,
undergone a succession of pandemic waves with changing
rules that stretched public confidence in government,
had their economic security and livelihoods negatively
impacted and been exposed to a media-­induced culture
of fear perpetuated by an abundance of conflicting and
confusing information. All of this occurred within the
broader global trend of increasing inequities between
North and South, rich and poor, as well as the erosion of
trust in institutions and experts.
It is likely that many of the alternative explanations
of the pandemic, often called conspiracy theories, were
further entrenched when vaccine policies were forcefully
implemented in 2021, creating a strong confirmation
bias that governments and corporate powers were acting
in an authoritarian manner. Those who resist vaccine
mandates and passports are more likely to have low
trust in government and scientific institutions,[25–28 63 64]
and these beliefs and distrust have likely grown due to
the propensity of policies to justify social segregation,
creating new forms of activism. Furthermore, multiple
social perceptions and logics about science, technology
and corporate and government power have been grafted
onto the public discussion about COVID-­19 vaccines,
specifically related to authoritarian biosurveillance
capabilities.[73] These include concerns about the adoption of implantable tracking devices (including microchips), digital IDs, the rise of social credit systems and
the censorship of online information by technology
companies and state security agencies. The COVID-­19
pandemic happens to coincide with far-­reaching technological advances that do provide the capability for
new forms of mass state surveillance.[74 75] For example,
emerging biocompatible intradermal devices can be used
to hold vaccine records,[76] while multifunction implantable microchips (that can regulate building access and
financial payments, much like cellphones) are now available on the market.[77] Aspects of vaccine passport policies
(dependent on QR codes) combined with these innovations—as well as censorship by social media companies
of vaccine clinical trial and safety issues from reputable
sources like the BMJ[78]—have likely reinforced and exacerbated suspicion and distrust about the impartiality of
public health guidance and vaccines.[79] It is highly likely


that reactance effects generated by current vaccine policies have increased the view that public health is influenced by powerful sociopolitical forces acting in the
private interest, which may damage future social trust in
pandemic response.

**THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL EFFECTS OF VACCINE MANDATES,**
**PASSPORTS AND RESTRICTIONS**
**The erosion of civil liberties**
The COVID-­19 vaccine policies that we have outlined
represent a broad interference with the rights of unvaccinated people. While some governments introduced
mandates and passports through the democratic process
(eg, Switzerland, Austria, France), many policies were
imposed as _regulations,_ _decrees, orders or_ _directions under_
states of emergency and implemented in ways that
allowed ad hoc juridical decisions and irregular and overpermissive private sector rules, with limited accountability or legal recourse to address rights violations.[58]

Vaccine passports risk enshrining discrimination based
on _perceived health status into law, undermining many_
rights of healthy individuals: indeed, unvaccinated but
previously infected people may generally be at _less risk_
of infection (and severe outcomes) than doubly vaccinated but infection-­naïve individuals.[80] A weekly negative SARS-­CoV-­2 test is often seen as a compromise in
lieu of full vaccination status, but this places additional
burdens (including financial) on the unvaccinated while
also risking reputational damage. Employer-­imposed
mandates that do not provide reasonable accommodation (eg, testing, relocation or reassignment of duties)
or that require people to be vaccinated following prior
infection even where employees can work remotely, arguably constitute a disproportionate imposition of a health
intervention without workplace-­related justification.[81]
Many countries have also tightened the ability to seek
religious, medical or philosophical exemptions, open
to unclear decision-­making and political interference.[82]
Perhaps the most high-­profile case to date involves the
deportation of the top-­ranked men’s tennis player, Novak
Djokovic, at the Australian Open 2022, despite having
been granted a medical exemption on the basis of documented prior infection.[83] While media outlets were quick
at hinting about problems in his official submission, the
Minister of Immigration accepted that he had a valid test
result and that he posed only a ‘very low’ risk to the health
of Australians.[84] Yet, the court ruled that it was reasonable for the Minister to conclude that Mr Djokovic’s presence could ‘foster anti-­vaccination sentiment’ and thus
have a negative impact on vaccination and boosters.[84]
It endorsed Mr Djokovic characterisation as a threat to
Australian ‘civil order and public health’.[83 84] The case
underlines concerns of vaccine mandates and passports
as a tool for disproportionate policy that circumvents
normative civil liberties and process.
There are also significant privacy issues with passports,
which involve sharing medical information with strangers.


-----

Having set these population-­wide passport precedents, it
is conceivable that they could be expanded in the near
future to include other personal health data including
genetic tests and mental health records, which would
create additional rights violations and discrimination
based on biological status for employers, law enforcement, insurance companies, governments and tech
companies. COVID-­19 vaccine passports have normalised
the use of QR codes as a regulated entry requirement
into social life; in France and Israel, double-­vaccinated
citizens lost their ‘status’ when passports required a
booster dose in 2021/2022.[85 86] Technology companies
interested in biosurveillance using artificial intelligence
and facial recognition technology have obtained large
contracts to implement vaccine passports and now have a
financial interest in maintaining and expanding them.[87]

**Political polarisation**
COVID-­19 vaccine policies have generated intense political debate, mass street protests and energised new populist movements with varied political views.[20 21 25–28 56] Studies
show that while many support these policies, others view
them as inherently coercive, discriminatory, disproportionate and counter to liberal values of bodily autonomy,
freedom of choice and informed consent.[25–28] It is
clear that current policies are divisive and unpopular
with many, even vaccinated people, and that they have
become a source for collective rage and anger, notably
for those who have been fired from their jobs or isolated
and barred from social life.
COVID-­19 vaccine policies may influence upcoming
elections. For instance, right-­wing and populist parties
in Germany (the Alternative for Germany), Canada
(People’s Party) and Austria (Freedom Party) have come
out strongly against medical segregation. After implementing the world’s first population-­wide mandatory
vaccine policy in February 2022, Austria suspended it
6 days before police would impose fines (max €3600),
partially due to legal concerns, mass street protests and
the fact that the rate of vaccination had not significantly
improved (20% of adults remain unvaccinated).[56 88] In
2022, the US Supreme Court struck down the Biden
administration’s federal vaccine mandate as unconstitutional,[89] just as it came into effect for 80 million workers
(although upholding the mandate for HCWs); republicans had long criticised the mandates.[90 91] In Martinique
and Guadalupe, vaccine passports have led to months
of political unrest and violent protests that threaten the
stability of the French government.[48] Pottinger[92] argued
that mandates and passports could trigger insurrection
and civil war in South Africa.
Just as the smallpox vaccination mandates in 1850s
Britain created the first ‘anti-­vax’ movement,[93] the backlash against COVID-­19 policies is energising a global
network connected by modern communication technology against these measures. These backlashes may
contribute to increased distrust of other vaccines and
foster new forms of radicalisation and protest. While


mainstream news outlets have voiced concern about
the rising ‘anti-­vaccination fervour’ among the far-­right,
and potential for violence,[94] centre and left politicians
have also used this rhetoric for their own agenda. In
Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau used majority support
for mandatory vaccination and passports to divide the
conservative opposition in the 2021 federal election. The
end to exemptions for unvaccinated truckers crossing the
US–Canadian border precipitated the trucker ‘freedom
convoy’ protests in early 2022 in Canada, which led to
weeks of protesters occupying streets outside parliament.
The protest ended with the unprecedented invoking of
the Emergencies Act, equivalent to martial law, which
was heavily criticised by civil liberty organisations and
included the freezing of protester bank accounts.[95 96] In
the USA, California and New York (Democrat-­controlled
states) have implemented COVID-­19 vaccine passports for
children while Florida, Georgia and Texas (Republican-­
controlled) are introducing legislation to remove childhood school vaccine mandates in general. Some medical
freedom and anti-­vaccination groups have made increasingly false and inflammatory claims, and business owners
and employees requiring QR codes for entry have been
targeted for abuse, in some cases. In turn, pro-­vaccine
advocates have equated anti-­mandate social groups as
‘anti-­vaxxers’ and even domestic terrorists, calling for
government agencies and social media companies to
strengthen censorship laws. Echo chambers have skewed
the reasonableness of risk assessment of some pro-­
mandate individuals, who now fear that unvaccinated
people are ‘unsafe’—physically but also culturally—
despite the scientific evidence. Political polarisation and
radicalisation—both anti-­mandate and pro-­mandate—
will increase if punitive vaccine policies continue.

**Disunity in global health governance**
Current vaccine policies risk furthering disunity in
global health governance. Despite the WHO stating in
early 2022 that boosters would prolong the pandemic
by contributing to vaccine hoarding and low supply,[97]
universities (including some global health departments)
in wealthy countries have mandated boosters for low-­risk
healthy students and faculty,[59] when vaccination rates
remained low in many low/middle-­income countries
(LMICs).[98] Efforts to pressure pharmaceutical companies (who developed vaccines with the support of publicly
funded research money) to remove patent protections
have proven unsuccessful.[99 100] Pharmaceutical companies have ensured that the costs of adverse effects are
borne by governments[101] ; in turn, the world’s tens of
millions of migrants and asylum-­seekers may be denied
COVID-­19 vaccines because of legal liability issues.[102]
Simultaneously, some scientists are calling the unvaccinated (as a homogeneous group) the source of future
variants (‘variant factories’) fuelling inflammatory rhetoric[103] that may have contributed to the heavily criticised
reaction to close international borders to southern Africa
during the spread of Omicron in late 2021. International


-----

travellers, especially from the global south, have been
barred from travelling to high-­income countries based
on the type of received vaccine.
The rollout of vaccine passports and mandates is financially costly and diverts resources and focus away from
other interventions. In Canada, $1 billion was pledged
by the Trudeau government for vaccine passports[104] and
in New York State, the Excelsior Pass App-­system developed by IBM will cost more than $27 million.[87] Importantly, focus on ‘the unvaccinated’ as the cause of health
system collapse diverts public attention away from global
equity failures and deep structural challenges facing
public health capacity in many countries. It absolves
governments of attending to other strategies for opening
schools and keeping public spaces safe, including
improved ventilation and paid sick leave. The indiscriminate global adoption of current COVID-­19 vaccine
policies may also compromise national sovereignty by
skewing health priorities in LMICs, taking budgets away
from other important health priorities and disregarding
public opinion—a new form of vaccine colonialism.
Perhaps more significantly, it is possible that vaccination
metrics become tied to international financial agreements and development loans and that pharmaceutical
and technology companies influence the global adoption
of passport systems and mandate policies for the current
but also future pandemics.

**SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS**
**Increasing disparity and inequality**
Historically, marginalised groups—those facing
economic challenges and racial and minority groups—
tend to have less confidence in vaccination programmes
and are more likely to be distrustful.[63–66 68–71] This raises
the possibility that current vaccine policies may fuel
existing inequity.[105] A rapid policy briefing by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics[106] emphasised that immunity
passports could ‘create coercive and stigmatising work
environments’ and are ‘more likely to compound than
redress…structural disadvantages and…social stigmatisation’.[106] It is highly likely that mandates and passports
have been implemented in ways that discriminate against
disadvantaged groups including immigrants, the homeless, isolated elderly people, those with mental illness,
specific cultural and religious groups, those in precarious living circumstances, and people with certain political views and values. Moreover, communities who have
historically been subject to state surveillance, segregation,
structural racism, trauma or violence may be more likely
to resist medical mandates. In Israel, reports suggest that
Bedouin and Palestinian communities in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory have faced major barriers to vaccine
access, with more distrust of vaccination and bureaucratic
barriers to accessing and using green passes even when
vaccinated.[58] Similar challenges have been raised among
Europe’s Roma and in black communities in the UK and
USA.[45 66 107] Altogether, rather than enhancing human


agency and strengthening communities and social cohesion, many current vaccine policies—including monthly
fines for non-­compliance (eg, Greece and Austria)—may
work to disempower individuals and contribute to long-­
term psychosocial stress and disharmony.

**Reduced health system capacity**
The pandemic has created immense strain on health
systems, contributing to disruptions in global immunisation programmes[108] and burnout in healthcare and social
care workers that risk worsening clinical outcomes for all
patients. These trends may be exaggerated by the current
policy push towards mandatory COVID-­19 vaccination
of healthcare/social care workers and firing of unvaccinated staff. The ethical arguments against these policies
have been outlined by others.[31 33 109]

Despite these considerations, many countries may
lose frontline staff due to mandates. By December 2021,
despite the forthcoming imposition of a (later rescinded)
vaccine mandate for patient-­facing National Health
Service (NHS) workers, 8% of medical practitioners in
the UK (73 000 people) remained unvaccinated.[110] In late
2021, Quebec (Canada) dropped its proposed mandate
for HCWs, citing the devastating labour shortage it would
cause in hospital systems (3% of staff, or 14 000, were
unvaccinated).[111] Both cases created immense stress on
already overburdened health staff and administrators,
and were decried for their lack of clarity and clumpy
policy process.[112]

**Exclusion from work and social life**
COVID-­19 vaccination policies that disproportionately restrict people’s access to work, education, public
transport and social life can be considered a violation
of constitutional and human rights.[113] The economic
effects of restricting access to work may also have indirect implications for dependents of the unvaccinated. A
survey in October 2021 in the USA found that 37% of
unvaccinated participants (5% of participants overall)
would leave their job if their employer required them
to get a vaccine or get tested weekly; this rose to 70%
of unvaccinated participants (9% of all participants) if
weekly testing was not an option.[114] Economic deprivation and parental stress resulting from restricted access to
work and exclusion from social life may have long-­term
psychological and livelihood consequences on individuals, families and especially children.[30] Commentators
have also highlighted the potential impact of mandates in
creating supply chain bottlenecks in certain commodities
and with cross-­border trade and argued that changing
vaccine rules and regulations threaten to negatively
impact overall economic recovery in some sectors of the
economy including tourism.[115]

**THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH**
**Erosion of key principles of public health ethics and law**
Current vaccine policies may erode core principles
of public health ethics. As some of those supporting


-----

mandates recognise,[113 116] and contrary to the media
portrayal that ‘the unvaccinated are entirely free to
decline’, many COVID-­19 vaccine policies clearly limit
choice and the normal operation of informed consent.
This has placed medical professionals in an awkward position, blurring the lines between voluntary and involuntary vaccination. It is clear that many who are vaccinated
did so because of the serious consequences of refusal,
such as loss of employment and livelihood or access to
social events and travel. We should pause to consider
the extent to which current policies, and how they are
implemented in clinical settings, sets a precedent for the
erosion of informed consent into the future and impact
the attitude of the medical profession to those who are
reticent to undergo a specific medical procedure.
According to public health ethics, the principle of
proportionality requires that the benefits of a public
health intervention must be expected to _outweigh the_
liberty restrictions and associated burdens.[32] It would
violate the proportionality principle to impose significant
liberty restrictions (and/or harms) in exchange for trivial
public health benefits, particularly when other options
are available. Evidence shows that the efficacy of current
COVID-­19 vaccines on reducing transmission is limited
and temporary,[7–16] likely lower in younger age groups
targeted for vaccine mandates and passports[36] and that
prior infection provides, roughly speaking, comparable
benefit.[18 31 80] The effectiveness of vaccine mandates in
reducing transmission is likely to be smaller than many
might have expected or have hoped for, and decrease
over time. These issues have been widely discussed in the
public arena, raising the idea that many current vaccine
policies are no longer being guided by the best science
but are rather being used to punish individuals who
remain unvaccinated and to shape public opinion and
compliance. Some governments have publicly admitted
this much; in the words of French President Emmanuel
Macron, the aim is to ‘piss off [the unvaccinated] …to
the end. This is the strategy.’[117] Mandating a third dose
for young boys to attend college or university in America
has been widely discussed in the US media despite the
lack of evidence for substantial clinical benefit,[59 118] and
with evidence of small but still significant risk of myocarditis that compounds with each dose.[119–121] Scandinavian countries have taken a precautionary and voluntary
approach in their recommendations to the vaccination of
children, with Swedish authorities stating that ‘[because
of] a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don’t see
any clear benefit with vaccinating them’.[122] This furthers
the perception that current COVID-­19 school vaccine
mandates (eg, in California) are disproportionate, especially as safety studies in young children remain relatively
sparse.[123]

Proportionality is also a key condition from a constitutional and human rights perspective.[113 124 125] The formal
requirements of legal proportionality tests, which differ
slightly depending on jurisdiction and context, generally
reflect a balancing similar to the one in public health


ethics. In part because of legally required restraint when
it comes to assessing the reasonableness of complex
policy interventions, several courts, human rights tribunals and committees, and labour arbitrators have upheld
mandates as proportionate or made statements as to
their legitimacy.[113] This appears to have led to a broad
presumption that mandates are legally unproblematic.
But a common requirement of legal proportionality is
that no other, less rights-­restricting measures are available that can reasonably achieve the key public health
goal. Accommodation of the workplace, or alternatives
to vaccination such as testing, should be and have often
been identified by courts, tribunals and arbitrators, as
being a core element of the legality of mandates.[81 113 124 126]
Mandates imposing unconditional vaccination, those
ignoring the role of prior infection, and those ignoring
a shifting risk/benefit balance depending on specific
populations, should be considered suspect from a legal
proportionality perspective.
When members of the public perceive mandates to be
ethically and legally problematic and in violation of established norms of informed consent and proportionality,
this will erode trust in public health and scientific institutions and even courts that endorsed or actively promoted
such policies. This presents a challenging paradox for
experts and authorities: will pro-­mandate scientists and
organisations come to acknowledge that mandates and
passports were disproportionate policy responses? One
key aspect of building trust in science and public health
involves the open acknowledgement of when experts are
wrong and when policies were misguided; however, it
appears that many officials have doubled down in their
narratives. This may undermine key ethical and legal
criteria for policy and have damaging effects on the
integrity of public health itself.

**Erosion of trust in regulatory oversight**
COVID-­19 vaccines were developed in record time
to meet an urgent public health need and have been
accepted by billions of people, preventing deaths, severe
hospitalisation and long-­term sequelae from SARS-­
CoV-­2.[3–6] COVID-­19 vaccines have also generated at least
$100 billion profit for pharmaceutical companies, especially Pfizer.[127] Has the acceptance of mandates and passports—and the rhetoric around ‘anti-­vaxxers’—contributed to a cultural shift in norms of scientific and corporate transparency and accountability?
Governments have refused to disclose the details of
contracts with manufacturers, including for additional
doses or ‘next-­generation’ vaccines.[99] Vaccines are typically not approved until 2 years of follow-­up data are gathered,[2] but given the urgency of the COVID-­19 pandemic
and international harmonisation of new agile regulations, the novel mRNA COVID-­19 vaccines were placed
into emergency use in Europe and North America in late
2020.[128] There is concern that, in the fog of crisis, vaccine
policy is being driven by vaccine manufacturers rather
than independent scientific and regulatory review. For


-----

example, in April 2021, Moderna informed their investors that they were expecting a robust ‘variant booster
market’ as a source of profits. Similarly, Pfizer CEO
Albert Bourla suggested that a fourth dose of vaccine
would be necessary, without any clinical trial data or independent evaluation that the benefits of subsequent doses
outweigh any risks, nor consideration of the changing
clinical dynamics with the Omicron variant.[118] This only
adds to distrust over decision-­making around vaccine
use and ensuing mandates. The public is aware of the
history of corporate pharmaceutical malfeasance and
criminal and civil settlements in the billions of dollars,
including with Pfizer, in part resulting from marketing
practices and misrepresentation of safety and efficacy of
medicines.[50 51 129]

The nature of mandates, passports and restrictions
has increased public demands for scientific accountability and transparency—shown to be fundamental to
building long-­term confidence in vaccination.[130] This has
increased the need to diligently track all safety signals for
adverse effects in specific demographics[131] and explore
trends in overall population mortality and potential
non-­specific effects.[132] However, the original clinical
trial data remain unavailable for independent scientific
scrutiny[50 51] ; a whistleblower raised important concerns
about data integrity and regulatory oversight practices at
a contract company helping with Pfizer’s clinical trials in
the USA.[133] After a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
[request by a civil society group (see: https://phmpt.org),](https://phmpt.org)
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested
(ultimately denied by a federal judge) 75 years to fully
release internal documents and communications related
to the regulatory process between FDA and Pfizer. In
September 2021, an FDA advisory committee voted 16–2
against boosting healthy young adults in the USA but was
over-­ridden by the White House and CDC, leading to the
resignation of two top FDA vaccine experts.[118] Such efforts
have only increased the perception that regulatory agencies are ‘captured’ by industry and would conveniently
ignore a higher than usual adverse effect ratio to control
the pandemic. Concerns have been raised about the lack
of due process in vaccine injury compensation claims
for the COVID-­19 vaccines,[100] which are to be borne by
governments and not pharmaceutical companies. A video
of a US congressional roundtable on COVID-­19 vaccine
adverse events with medically confirmed vaccine-­injured
individuals from the original clinical trials, a US military
clinician and Peter Doshi (senior editor of the BMJ) was
permanently removed by YouTube.[134] These practices
do not reinforce confidence that authorities are being
transparent or applying optimal standards for regulatory
safety, efficacy and quality for these novel vaccines—standards which should arguably be more stringent given the
legal precedent for mandates and passports.


**CONCLUSION**
The adoption of new vaccination policies has provoked
backlash, resistance and polarisation. It is important to
emphasise that these policies are not viewed as ‘incentives’ or ‘nudges’ by substantial proportions of populations[25–28 41 45] especially in marginalised, underserved or
low COVID-­19-­risk groups. Denying individuals education, livelihoods, medical care or social life unless they
get vaccinated—especially in light of the limitations
with the current vaccines—is arguably in tension with
constitutional and bioethical principles, especially in
liberal democracies.[30–33] While public support consolidated behind these policies in many countries, we should
acknowledge that ethical frameworks were designed to
ensure that rights and liberties are respected even during
public health emergencies.
Vaccination policies can be an important tool in the
promotion of the right to health, but they need to be
proportionate and designed to achieve a clearly defined
goal. Some of those supporting current restrictions based
on vaccination status[116] seem to accept too easily that
these measures are indeed proportionate; that they are
not more restrictive than necessary; that they are effective
in preventing transmission and protecting the healthcare
system from collapse; and that there are no options available other than punitive mandates, passports and segregated restrictions. As illustrated above, we believe that
current vaccine policies have failed on these fronts and
are no longer fit for purpose.
We encourage social and behavioural scientists, bioethicists, epidemiologists, legal scholars, and others to assess
the benefits and harms of COVID-­19 vaccination policies,
along with wider open multidisciplinary discussion and
debate. Empirical assessments may or may not validate
the concerns presented in this paper—but their generation is critical in engagement with politicians, scientists,
and organisations to reconsider current policies affecting
those who remain unvaccinated as well as those who vaccinated due to threats and pressure. COVID-­19 will not be
the last public health emergency and it remains critical
that we understand the reasons these approaches were
adopted and provide robust evidence to improve future
policymaking in times of health emergencies.[135] If not,
the proclivity for mandates, passports, restrictions, fines
and punishments is likely to become an accepted policy
response for the next pandemic irrespective of whether
such policies are truly effective, ethical and socially
harmful.
If current policies are to continue, public health-­

associated bureaucracies and society will have to increase
coercion to address current and future resistance and,
in the process, come to leverage strategies more consistent with policing than public health. We may also see
political forces double down and use people who have
chosen not to get vaccinated as a collective, psychological and political tool to scapegoat and reinforce a false
notion of safety among vaccinated people as they yearn
to resume social and economic life. Policymakers should


-----

reflect on the necessity of enforcing what is essentially a
new two-­tier, segregated social system and how this will
affect different social groups now and into the future—
behaviourally, politically and socioeconomically—as well
as the impact of such policies on the integrity of science
and public health itself.
There are other options to address the pandemic and
it is not too late to return to non-­coercive public health
measures, including pro-­social language and community leadership for vaccination, especially to protect
high-­risk groups.[7] Future investments in public health
capacity, especially health providers who build relationships of trust working in communities, will be essential
to engage in positive reforms. Improving data transparency, media independence and broad public debate and
scrutiny about COVID-­19 vaccine policies will also be
essential to maintain population trust, help people better
understand the risks and benefits of the continued use
of current vaccines, and to inform research on improvements and future policies.

1. Introduction


a b s t r a c t

Introduction: In 2020, prior to COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the Brighton Collaboration created a priority list,
endorsed by the World Health Organization, of potential adverse events relevant to COVID-19 vaccines.
We adapted the Brighton Collaboration list to evaluate serious adverse events of special interest observed
in mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials.
Methods: Secondary analysis of serious adverse events reported in the placebo-controlled, phase III randomized clinical trials of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in adults (NCT04368728 and
NCT04470427), focusing analysis on Brighton Collaboration adverse events of special interest.
Results: Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious
adverse events of special interest of 10.1 and 15.1 per 10,000 vaccinated over placebo baselines of
17.6 and 42.2 (95 % CI �0.4 to 20.6 and �3.6 to 33.8), respectively. Combined, the mRNA vaccines were
associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated
(95 % CI 2.1 to 22.9); risk ratio 1.43 (95 % CI 1.07 to 1.92). The Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 % higher risk of
serious adverse events in the vaccine group; risk difference 18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 1.2 to
34.9); risk ratio 1.36 (95 % CI 1.02 to 1.83). The Moderna trial exhibited a 6 % higher risk of serious adverse
events in the vaccine group: risk difference 7.1 per 10,000 (95 % CI –23.2 to 37.4); risk ratio 1.06 (95 % CI
0.84 to 1.33). Combined, there was a 16 % higher risk of serious adverse events in mRNA vaccine recipients: risk difference 13.2 (95 % CI �3.2 to 29.6); risk ratio 1.16 (95 % CI 0.97 to 1.39).
Discussion: The excess risk of serious adverse events found in our study points to the need for formal
harm-benefit analyses, particularly those that are stratified according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. These analyses will require public release of participant level datasets.

updated a ‘‘priority list of potential adverse events of special interest relevant to COVID-19 vaccine trials.” [1] The list comprises
adverse events of special interest (AESIs) based on the specific vaccine platform, adverse events associated with prior vaccines in
general, theoretical associations based on animal models, and
COVID-19 specific immunopathogenesis. [1] The Brighton Collaboration is a global authority on the topic of vaccine safety and in
May 2020, the World Health Organization’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety endorsed and recommended the reporting of AESIs based on this priority list. To our knowledge,
however, the list has not been applied to serious adverse events
in randomized trial data.

We sought to investigate the association between FDAauthorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and serious adverse events
identified by the Brighton Collaboration, using data from the phase
III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials on which authorization was based. We consider these trial data against findings
from post-authorization observational safety data. Our study was
not designed to evaluate the overall harm-benefit of vaccination
programs so far. To put our safety results in context, we conducted
a simple comparison of harms with benefits to illustrate the need
for formal harm-benefit analyses of the vaccines that are stratified
according to risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. Our analysis is
restricted to the randomized trial data, and does not consider data
on post-authorization vaccination program impact. It does however show the need for public release of participant level trial
datasets.

2. Methods

Pfizer and Moderna each submitted the results of one phase III
randomized trial in support of the FDA’s emergency use authorization of their vaccines in adults. Two reviewers (PD and RK)
searched journal publications and trial data on the FDA’s and
Health Canada’s websites to locate serious adverse event results
tables for these trials. The Pfizer and Moderna trials are expected
to follow participants for two years. Within weeks of the emergency authorization, however, the sponsors began a process of
unblinding all participants who elected to be unblinded. In addition, those who received placebo were offered the vaccine. These
self-selection processes may have introduced nonrandom differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, thus rendering the post-authorization data less reliable. Therefore, to
preserve randomization, we used the interim datasets that were
the basis for emergency authorization in December 2020, approximately 4 months after trials commenced.
The definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) was provided in
each trial’s study protocol and included in the supplemental material of the trial’s publication. [2–4] Pfizer and Moderna used nearly
identical definitions, consistent with regulatory expectations. An
SAE was defined as an adverse event that results in any of the following conditions: death; life-threatening at the time of the event;
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital
anomaly/birth defect; medically important event, based on medical judgment.
In addition to journal publications, we searched the websites of
the FDA (for advisory committee meeting materials) and Health
Canada (for sections of the dossier submitted by sponsors to the
regulator). [5] For the FDA website, we considered presentations
by both the FDA and the sponsors. [6] Within each of these sources,
we searched for SAE results tables that presented information by
specific SAE type; we chose the most recent SAE table corresponding to the FDA’s requirement for a safety median follow-up time of
at least 2 months after dose 2.
For each trial, we prepared blinded SAE tables (containing SAE
types without results data). Using these blinded SAE tables, two
clinician reviewers (JF and JE) independently judged whether each
SAE type was an AESI. SAE types that matched an AESI term verbatim, or were an alternative diagnostic name for an AESI term, were
included as an AESI. For all other SAE types, the reviewers independently judged whether that SAE type was likely to have been
caused by a vaccine-induced AESI, based on a judgment considering the disease course, causative mechanism, and likelihood of
the AESI to cause the SAE type. Disagreements were resolved
through consensus; if consensus could not be reached, a third clin

included SAE, we recorded the corresponding Brighton Collaboration AESI category and organ system. When multiple AESIs could
potentially cause the same SAE, the reviewers selected the AESI
that they judged to be the most likely cause based on classical clinical presentation of the AESI.
We used an AESI list derived from the work of Brighton Collaboration’s Safety Platform for Emergency vACcines (SPEAC) Project.
This project created an AESI list which categorizes AESIs into three
categories: those included because they are seen with COVID-19,
those with a proven or theoretical association with vaccines in
general, and those with proven or theoretical associations with
specific vaccine platforms. The first version was produced in March
2020 based on experience from China. Following the second
update (May 2020), the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) adopted the list, and Brighton commenced a
systematic review process ‘‘to ensure an ongoing understanding
of the full spectrum of COVID-19 disease and modification of the
AESI list accordingly.” [7] This resulted in three additional AESIs
being added to the list in December 2020. The subsequent (and
most recent fourth) update did not result in any additional AESIs
being added to the list. [1].
We matched SAEs recorded in the trial against an expanded list
of AESIs created by combining Brighton’s SPEAC COVID-19 AESI list
with a list of 29 clinical diagnoses Brighton identified as ‘‘known to
have been reported but not in sufficient numbers to merit inclusion on the AESI list.” [7] Sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether use of the original versus expanded list altered our
results.
Risk ratios and risk differences between vaccine and placebo
groups were calculated for the incidence of AESIs and SAEs. We
excluded SAEs that were known efficacy outcomes (i.e. COVID19), consistent with the approach Pfizer (but not Moderna) used
in recording SAE data. The Pfizer study trial protocol states that
COVID-19 illnesses and their sequelae consistent with the clinical
endpoint definition were not to be reported as adverse events,
‘‘even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE.” [8]
For unspecified reasons, Moderna included efficacy outcomes in
their SAE tables, effectively reporting an all-cause SAE result.
Because we did not have access to individual participant data, to
account for the occasional multiple SAEs within single participants,
we reduced the effective sample size by multiplying standard
errors in the combined SAE analyses by the square root of the ratio
of the number of SAEs to the number of patients with an SAE. This
adjustment increased standard errors by 10 % (Pfizer) and 18 %
(Moderna), thus expanding the interval estimates. We estimated
combined risk ratios and risk differences for the two mRNA vaccines by averaging over the risks using logistic regression models
which included indicators for trial and treatment group.
We used a simple harm-benefit framework to place our results
in context, comparing risks of excess serious AESIs against reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization.

3. Results

Serious adverse event tables were located for each of the vaccine trials submitted for EUA in adults (age 16 + for Pfizer,
18 + for Moderna) in the United States: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID19 vaccine BNT162b2 (NCT04368728) [2,9,10] and Moderna
COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 (NCT04470427). [3,11,12]

reported all data at the time of data cutoff (14 Nov 2020 for Pfizer,
25 Nov 2020 for Moderna). 17 SAEs that were efficacy endpoints
were removed from the Moderna trial (16 ‘‘COVID-19” SAEs and
1 ‘‘COVID-19 pneumonia” SAE). One such efficacy endpoint meeting the definition of a SAE was removed from the Pfizer trial
(‘‘SARS-CoV-2 test positive” SAE).
The Pfizer trial exhibited a 36 % higher risk of serious adverse
events in vaccinated participants in comparison to placebo recipients: 67.5 per 10,000 versus 49.5 per 10,000; risk difference 18.0
per 10,000 vaccinated participants (95 % compatibility[1] interval
1.2 to 34.9); risk ratio 1.36 (95 % CI 1.02 to 1.83). The Moderna trial
exhibited a 6 % higher risk of SAEs in vaccinated individuals compared to those receiving placebo: 136 per 10,000 versus 129 per
10,000; risk difference 7.1 per 10,000 (95 % CI –23.2 to 37.4); risk
ratio 1.06 (95 % CI 0.84 to 1.33). Combined, there was a 16 % higher
risk of SAEs in mRNA vaccine recipients than placebo recipients: 98
per 10,000 versus 85 per 10,000; risk difference 13.2 (95 % CI �3.2 to
29.6); risk ratio 1.16 (95 % CI 0.97 to 1.39). (Table 2).

3.2. Serious adverse events of special interest

Regarding whether each SAE type was included on the SPEAC
derived AESI list, agreement between the two independent clinician reviewers was 86 % (281/325); 40 of the 44 disagreements
were resolved through consensus, and only four disagreements
necessitated a third clinician reviewer. Supplemental Table 1
includes a full list of included and excluded SAEs across both trials.
In the Pfizer trial, 52 serious AESI (27.7 per 10,000) were
reported in the vaccine group and 33 (17.6 per 10,000) in the placebo group. This difference corresponds to a 57 % higher risk of
serious AESI (RR 1.57 95 % CI 0.98 to 2.54) and a risk difference
of 10.1 serious AESI per 10,000 vaccinated participants (95 % CI
�0.4 to 20.6). In the Moderna trial, 87 serious AESI (57.3 per
10,000) were reported in the vaccine group and 64 (42.2 per
10,000) in the placebo group. This difference corresponds to a
36 % higher risk of serious AESI (RR 1.36 95 % CI 0.93 to 1.99)
and a risk difference of 15.1 serious AESI per 10,000 vaccinated
participants (95 % CI �3.6 to 33.8). Combining the trials, there
was a 43 % higher risk of serious AESI (RR 1.43; 95 % CI 1.07 to
1.92) and a risk difference of 12.5 serious AESI per 10,000 vaccinated participants (95 % CI 2.1 to 22.9). (Table 2).
Of the 236 serious AESIs occurring across the Pfizer and Moderna trials, 97 % (230/236) were adverse event types included as
AESIs because they are seen with COVID-19. In both Pfizer and
Moderna trials, the largest excess risk occurred amongst the
Brighton category of coagulation disorders. Cardiac disorders have
been of central concern for mRNA vaccines; in the Pfizer trial more
cardiovascular AESIs occurred in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, but in the Moderna trial the groups differed by only 1
case. (Tables 3 and 4).

1 A compatibility interval is identical to a confidence interval, but relabeled to
emphasize that it is not a Bayesian posterior interval (as is improperly suggested by


3.3. Sensitivity analysis

As a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the serious AESI analysis
to those AESIs listed in SPEAC’s COVID-19 AESI list (i.e. separating
out Brighton’s list of 29 clinical diagnoses ‘‘known to have been
reported but not in sufficient numbers to merit inclusion on the
AESI list.”) This reduced the total number of AESIs across the two
trials by 48 (35 vaccine group, 13 placebo group). There was still
a higher risk of serious AESI when limited to the SPEAC COVID19 AESI list, but the magnitude of the excess (in both relative
and absolute terms) was smaller than when using the larger AESI
list. (Supplemental Table 2).

3.4. Harm-benefit considerations

In the Moderna trial, the excess risk of serious AESIs (15.1 per
10,000 participants) was higher than the risk reduction for
COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (6.4 per
10,000 participants). [3] In the Pfizer trial, the excess risk of serious
AESIs (10.1 per 10,000) was higher than the risk reduction for
COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group (2.3 per
10,000 participants).

4. Comparison with FDA reviews

In their review of SAEs supporting the authorization of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the FDA concluded that SAEs were, for
Pfizer, ‘‘balanced between treatment groups,” [15] and for Moderna, were ‘‘without meaningful imbalances between study arms.”

[16] In contrast to the FDA analysis, we found an excess risk of
SAEs in the Pfizer trial. Our analysis of Moderna was compatible
with FDA’s analysis, finding no meaningful SAE imbalance between
groups.
The difference in findings for the Pfizer trial, between our SAE
analysis and the FDA’s, may in part be explained by the fact that
the FDA analyzed the total number of participants experiencing
any SAE, whereas our analysis was based on the total number of
SAE events. Given that approximately twice as many individuals
in the vaccine group than in the placebo group experienced multiple SAEs (there were 24 more events than participants in the vaccine group, compared to 13 in the placebo group), FDA’s analysis of
only the incidence of participants experiencing any SAE would not
reflect the observed excess of multiple SAEs in the vaccine group.
A more important factor, however, may be that FDA’s review of
non-fatal SAEs used a different analysis population with different
follow-up windows. The FDA reported 126 of 21,621 (0.6 %) of vaccinated participants experienced at least one SAE at data cutoff
compared to 111 of 21,631 (0.5 %) of placebo participants. In contrast, our analysis found 127 SAEs among 18,801 vaccine recipients
versus 93 SAEs among 18,785 placebo recipients. [15] While summary results for the population we analyzed was provided in a
table, FDA did not report an analysis of them. The substantially larger denominators in FDA’s analysis (5,666 more participants)
reflect the fact that their analysis included all individuals receiving

been inadvertently included, which we removed from our calculations (‘‘SARS-CoV-2 test positive”: 0 vaccine group; 1 placebo group).
c Moderna included efficacy outcomes in its SAE table (COVID-19 illnesses and their sequelae meeting the definition of an SAE). We removed efficacy SAEs outcomes that

therefore remain included in this analysis.

our analysis was based on the study population with median
follow-up � 2 months after dose 2 (minus 120 HIV-positive participants), of which 98.1 % had received both doses. [2,17] The FDA’s
analysis of SAEs thus included thousands of additional participants
with very little follow-up, of which the large majority had only
received 1 dose.

4.1. Comparison with post-authorization studies

Although the randomized trials offer high level evidence for
evaluating causal effects, the sparsity of their data necessitates that
harm-benefit analyses also consider observational studies. Since
their emergency authorization in December 2020, hundreds of millions of doses of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have been
administered and post-authorization observational data offer a
complementary opportunity to study AESIs. Post-authorization
observational safety studies include cohort studies (which make


tionality analyses (which use spontaneous adverse event reporting
systems). In July 2021, the FDA reported detecting four potential
adverse events of interest: pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial
infarction, immune thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation following Pfizer’s vaccine based on medical
claims data in older Americans. [18] Three of these four serious
adverse event types would be categorized as coagulation disorders,
which is the Brighton AESI category that exhibited the largest
excess risk in the vaccine group in both the Pfizer and Moderna trials. FDA stated it would further investigate the findings but at the
time of our writing has not issued an update. Similarly,
spontaneous-reporting systems have registered serious adverse
reactions including anaphylaxis (all COVID-19 vaccines), thrombocytopenia syndrome among premenopausal females (Janssen vaccine), and myocarditis and pericarditis among younger males
(Pfizer and Moderna vaccines). [19,20].

the present study. [21–23] For example, a study using VAERS and
EudraVigilance comparing the disproportionality of adverse event
reports between the influenza vaccine versus the mRNA COVID19 vaccines reported excess risks for the following Brighton AESIs:
cardiovascular events, coagulation events, hemorrhages, gastrointestinal events, and thromboses. [22] While CDC published a protocol[24] in early 2021 for using proportional reporting ratios for
signal detection in the VAERS database, results from the study have
not yet been reported. [25] Among self-controlled case series, one
reported a rate ratio of 1.38 (95 % CI 1.12–1.71) for hemorrhagic
stroke following Pfizer vaccine, [26] another reported 0.97 (95 %
CI 0.81–1.15), [27] while a cohort study[28] reported 0.84 (95 %
CI 0.54–1.27).

5. Discussion

Using a prespecified list of AESI identified by the Brighton Collaboration, higher risk of serious AESI was observed in the mRNA
COVID-19 vaccine group relative to placebo in both the Pfizer
and Moderna adult phase III trials, with 10.1 (Pfizer) and 15.1
(Moderna) additional events for every 10,000 individuals vaccinated. Combined, there was a risk difference of 12.5 serious AESIs
per 10,000 individuals vaccinated (95 % CI 2.1 to 22.9). These
results raise concerns that mRNA vaccines are associated with
more harm than initially estimated at the time of emergency
authorization. In addition, our analysis identified a 36 % higher risk
of serious adverse events in vaccinated participants in the Pfizer
trial: 18.0 additional SAEs per 10,000 vaccinated (95 % CI 1.2 to
34.9). Consistent with the FDA evaluation, our analysis found no
clear difference in SAEs between groups in the Moderna trial.
Results between the Pfizer and Moderna trials were similar for
the AESI analysis but exhibited substantial variation in the SAE
analysis. Caution is needed in interpreting this variation as it


practices in the trials rather than differences in actual vaccine
harm profiles. For reasons that are not documented in the trial protocol, Moderna included efficacy outcomes in its SAE tabulations,
while Pfizer excluded them. As a result, Moderna’s SAE table did
not present a traditional SAE analysis but rather an all-cause SAE
analysis. The FDA analysis of the Moderna trial presented an allcause SAE analysis, which estimates total vaccine effects on SAEs,
including effects transmitted via effects on COVID-19. It did not
however present a traditional SAE analysis with efficacy endpoints
removed, which attempts to estimate only the direct effects on
SAEs. While our analysis attempted to perform a traditional SAE
analysis by excluding efficacy SAEs (serious COVID-19 and its
sequelae), our effort was hindered because we did not have access
to patient level data. Easily recognizable efficacy SAEs (‘‘COVID19”, ‘‘COVID-19 pneumonia,” and ‘‘SARS-CoV-2 test positive”)
could be removed, but many participants who experienced a
COVID-19 SAE likely experienced multiple other SAEs (e.g. pneumonia, hypoxia, and thrombotic events) which could not be identified and therefore remain included in our analysis. Of 17 total
efficacy SAEs (16 ‘‘COVID-19” and 1 ‘‘COVID-19 pneumonia”)
removed from our analysis of the Moderna trial, 16 were in the placebo arm. As a consequence, the background SAE risk (risk in
absence of COVID-19) would be overestimated by the Moderna
placebo group, resulting in underestimation of the actual risk of
SAEs and AESIs attributable to the vaccine in the Moderna comparisons as well as in the combined analysis. Access to patient-level
data would allow adjustments for this problem.
Rational policy formation should consider potential harms
alongside potential benefits. [29] To illustrate this need in the present context, we conducted a simple harm-benefit comparison
using the trial data comparing excess risk of serious AESI against
reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization. We found excess risk of
serious AESIs to exceed the reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations
i b h fi d d i l

This analysis has the limitations inherent in most harm-benefit
comparisons. First, benefits and harms are rarely exact equivalents,
and there can be great variability in the degree of severity within
both benefit and harm endpoints. For example, intubation and
short hospital stay are not equivalent but both are counted in
‘‘hospitalization”; similarly, serious diarrhea and serious stroke
are not equivalent but both are counted in ‘‘SAE.” Second, individuals value different endpoints differently. Third, without individual
participant data, we could only compare the number of individuals
hospitalized for COVID-19 against the number of serious AESI
events, not the number of participants experiencing any serious
AESI. Some individuals experienced multiple SAEs whereas hospitalized COVID-19 participants were likely only hospitalized once,
biasing the analysis towards exhibiting net harm. To gauge the
extent of this bias, we considered that there were 20 % (Pfizer)
and 34 % (Moderna) more SAEs than participants experiencing
any SAE. As a rough sensitivity calculation, if we divide the Pfizer
excess serious AESI risk of 10.1 by 1.20 it becomes 8.4 compared
to a COVID-19 hospitalization risk reduction of 2.3; if we divide
the Moderna excess serious AESI risk of 15.1 by 1.34 it becomes
11.3 compared to a COVID-19 hospitalization risk reduction of 6.4.
Harm-benefit ratios will be different for populations at different
risk for serious COVID-19 and observation periods that differ from
those studied in the trials. Presumably, larger reductions in COVID19 hospitalizations would have been recorded if trial follow-up
were longer, more SARS-CoV-2 was circulating, or if participants
had been at higher risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, shifting
harm-benefit ratios toward benefit. Conversely, harm-benefit
ratios would presumably shift towards harm for those with lower
risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes--such as those with natural
immunity, younger age or no comorbidities. Similarly, waning vaccine effectiveness, decreased viral virulence, and increasing degree
of immune escape from vaccines might further shift the harmbenefit ratio toward harm. Large, randomized trials in contemporary populations could robustly answer these questions. Absent
definitive trials, however, synthesis of multiple lines of evidence
will be essential. [30,48,49].
Adverse events detected in the post-marketing period have led
to the withdrawal of several vaccines. An example is intussusception following one brand of rotavirus vaccine: around 1 million
children were vaccinated before identification of intussusception,
which occurred in around 1 per 10,000 vaccinees. [31] Despite
the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 vaccine administration, the
AESI types identified in our study may still be challenging to detect
with observational methods. Most observational analyses are
based on comparing the risks of adverse events ‘‘observed” against
a background (or ‘‘expected”) risk, which inevitably display great
variation, by database, age group, and sex. [32] If the actual risk
ratio for the effect was 1.4 (the risk ratio of the combined AESI
analysis), it could be quite difficult to unambiguously replicate it
with observational data given concerns about systematic as well
as random errors. [33–35].
In addition, disproportionality analyses following COVID-19
vaccination also have limitations, particularly with respect to the
type of adverse events seen in our study. The majority of SAEs that
contributed to our results are relatively common events, such as
ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and brain hemorrhage.
This complicates signal detection because clinical suspicion of an
adverse vaccine reaction following an event commonly seen in
clinical practice will be lower than for SAEs like myocarditis.[50]
For this reason, clinical suspicion leading to the filing of an individual case safety report--may be far less common in the postauthorization setting than in the trials. At the same time, heightened awareness about COVID-19 vaccine SAEs can result in under
and overreporting. Public health messages assuring vaccine safety


whereas messages about potential harms can conversely stimulate
reports that otherwise may not have been made. These factors can
lead to bias both directions, further complicating interpretation. In
contrast to these problems, in the randomized trials used in this
analysis, all SAEs were to be recorded, irrespective of clinical judgment regarding potential causality.
Although our analysis is secondary, reanalyses of clinical trial
data have led to the detection of adverse events well after the market entry of major drugs such as rofecoxib and rosiglitazone.

[36,37] Our analysis has an advantage over postmarketing observational studies in that the data are from blinded, placebo-controlled
randomized trials vetted by the FDA, which were matched against
a list of adverse events created before the availability of the
clinical-trial results and designed for use in COVID-19 vaccine
trials.
Our study has several important limitations. First, Pfizer’s trial
did not report SAEs occurring past 1 month after dose 2. This
reporting threshold may have led to an undercounting of serious
AESIs in the Pfizer trial. Second, for both studies, the limited follow
up time prevented an analysis of harm-benefit over a longer period. Third, all SAEs in our analysis met the regulatory definition
of a serious adverse event, but many adverse event types which
a patient may themselves judge as serious may not meet this regulatory threshold. Fourth, decisions about which SAEs to include or
exclude as AESIs requires subjective, clinical judgements in the
absence of detailed clinical information about the actual SAEs.
We encourage third party replication of our study, with access to
complete SAE case narratives, to determine the degree to which
these decisions affected our findings. For additional sensitivity
analyses, such replication studies could also make use of other AESI
lists, such as those prepared by FDA, [38–41] CDC, [24], Pfizer, [42],
or a de novo AESI list derived from a list of COVID-19 complications
understood to be induced via SARS-CoV-2[0]s spike protein. [43,44].
A fifth important limitation is our lack of access to individual
participant data, which forced us to use a conservative adjustment
to the standard errors. The 95 % CIs[13,14] calculated are therefore
only approximate because we do not know which patients had
multiple events. Finally, as described above, in the Moderna analysis, the SAEs that were sequelae of serious COVID-19 could not
be identified and therefore remain included in our calculations.
Because the vaccines prevent SAEs from COVID-19 while adding
SAE risks of their own, this inclusion makes it impossible to separately estimate SAEs due to the vaccine from SAEs due to COVID-19
in the available Moderna data, as must be done to extrapolate
harm-benefit to other populations. These study limitations all stem
from the fact that the raw data from COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials are not publicly available. [45,46].
We emphasize that our investigation is preliminary, to point to
the need for more involved analysis. The risks of serious AESIs in
the trials represent only group averages. SAEs are unlikely to be
distributed equally across the demographic subgroups enrolled in
the trial, and the risks may be substantially less in some groups
compared to others. Thus, knowing the actual demographics of
those who experienced an increase in serious AESI in the vaccine
group is necessary for a proper harm-benefit analysis. In addition,
clinical studies are needed to see if particular SAEs can be linked to
particular vaccine ingredients as opposed to unavoidable consequences of exposure to spike protein, as future vaccines could then
be modified accordingly or sensitivities can be tested for in
advance. In parallel, a systematic review and meta-analysis using
individual participant data should be undertaken to address questions of harm-benefit in various demographic subgroups, particularly in those at low risk of serious complications from COVID19. Finally, there is a pressing need for comparison of SAEs and
harm-benefit for different vaccine types; some initial work has

Full transparency of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data is
needed to properly evaluate these questions. Unfortunately, as
we approach 2 years after release of COVID-19 vaccines, participant level data remain inaccessible. [45,46].

#### Wireless technologies, non-TagedH1 ionizing electromagnetic fields and children: Identifying and reducing health risks

###### Devra Davis, PhD, MPH,TagedP [a][,][b]* Linda Birnbaum, PhD,[c][,][#] Paul Ben-Ishai, PhD,[d]

Children today are conceived and live in a sea of wireless radiation
that did not exist when their parents were born. The launch of the
digital age continues to transform the capacity to respond to emergencies and extend global communications. At the same time that
this increasingly ubiquitous technology continues to alter the nature
of commerce, medicine, transport and modern life overall, its varied
and changing forms have not been evaluated for their biological or
environmental impacts. Standards for evaluating radiation from
numerous wireless devices were first set in 1996 to avoid heating
tissue and remain unchanged since then in the U.S. and many other
nations. A wide range of evidence indicates that there are numerous non-thermal effects from wireless radiation on reproduction,
development, and chronic illness. Many widely used devices such
as phones and tablets function as two-way microwave radios, sending and receiving various frequencies of information-carrying microwave radiation on multiple simultaneously operating antennas.
Expert groups advising governments on this matter do not agree on
the best approaches to be taken. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limited screen time for children under the age of
two, but more than half of all toddlers regularly have contact with
screens, often without parental engagement. Young children of
parents who frequently use devices as a form of childcare can


experience delays in speech acquisition and bonding, while older
children report feelings of disappointment due to ‘technoference’—
parental distraction due to technology. Children who begin using
devices early in life can become socially, psychologically and physically addicted to the technology and experience withdrawal upon
cessation. We review relevant experimental, epidemiological and
clinical evidence on biological and other impacts of currently used
wireless technology, including advice to include key questions at
pediatric wellness checkups from infancy to young adulthood. We
conclude that consistent with advice in pediatric radiology, an
approach that recommends that microwave radiation exposures be
As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) seems sensible and
prudent, and that an independently-funded training, research and
monitoring program should be carried out on the long term physical
and psychological impacts of rapidly changing technological
milieu, including ways to mitigate impacts through modifications in
hardware and software. Current knowledge of electrohypersensitivity indicates the importance of reducing wireless exposures especially in schools and health care settings.

devices. Reports of serious behavioral problems
including problems with self-control, socialization,
language acquisition and the like have been associated
with device addiction; and internet gaming disorder is
on the rise in all age groups.[6]
Decades of research on RFR (including micro-TagedP
waves) indicate that everyday exposure to wireless
devices can impact the physical, emotional and psychological health and well-being of adults and children.[7] A growing number of independent researchers
find that while regulators, such as the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation
(ICNIRP) currently consider “low-level” exposures
safe; these levels do in fact place children’s endocrine,
reproductive, and immune systems at risk. These current regulatory limits are based on the assumption that
over-heating by high power RFR is the only established health effect to be avoided. Nevertheless,
numerous studies find that nonthermal levels of RFR
can cause major adverse effects such as induction of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, cardiomyopathy, carcinogenicity, sperm damage, memory
damage, and neurological effects.[8] As with many
other chemical and physical hazards, there is evidence
indicating that greater detrimental impacts take place
when exposures occur during critical phases of growth
and development, including pregnancy.[9]


Since the 1990s, member states of the EuropeanTagedP
Union and the FCC have looked to the ICNIRP[10] and
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE)[11] for risk assessments and guidance on occupational and public exposure to RFR from all sources.
These groups assume that only thermal effects (excessive heating) are to be avoided. In contrast, the International Commission on Biological Effects of
Electromagnetic Fields (ICBE-EMF)[12] and the Oceania Radiofrequency Scientific Assessment Association (ORSAA),[13][,][14] among others, reject the
assumptions on which ICNIRP relies, providing
detailed grounds for their positions.[15] Moreover, the
former editor-in-chief of the journal Bioelectromagnetics[16] contends that standards for evaluating wireless phones and other devices have not kept pace with
developments in technology finding that nonthermal
effects do occur and therefore current FCC standards
do not protect public health.
Regulations on both sides of the Atlantic have inTagedP
common that they are founded on risk assessments
conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s by industry
scientists and their affiliates in the IEEE. Despite a
considerable weight of evidence indicating serious
biological and environmental impacts of nonthermal
levels of RFR, the FCC and the ICNIRP risk assessments of non-ionizing radiation from phones and other
devices have remained unchanged for decades.

###### ElectromagnetismTagedH2

The theory of electromagnetism emerged in 1865TagedP
when James Clerk Maxwell unified Amp�ere’s work
on electricity, and Faraday’s and others’ work on
magnetism into one unified theory.[17][,][18]
Simply put, an electric charge or the movement ofTagedP
electric charge (in electric currents through wires and
devices) influences other charges or electrical currents
at a distance. The influence, called a “field,” results
from attractive and repulsive forces between electrical
charges. Positive and negative charges attract, while
two charges of the same sign are forced apart. Of particular importance is how an oscillating charge creates
a field that likewise oscillates, and this disturbance
(called “radiation”) propagates outward as a wave.
Imagine a child flicking a skipping rope—the ‘flick’
propagates down the rope in the same fashion as the
electric field propagates in the form of a wave. The
theory was experimentally confirmed in 1887 by
Heinrich Hertz.[19][,][20]
The duality of a wave is illustrated inTagedP Fig. 3. The
oscillation can be described as a sine wave that
depends both on the time and place of observation.
The top frame of the Figure depicts the oscillation of
the wave as seen by an observer standing in one place
and looking over a period of time. One can imagine
standing near the ocean and staring at a buoy as it
undulates up and down as waves pass below. The bottom panel looks the same but depicts how at one
instant in time the waves would look at every spot.
Rather like standing on the same spot near the ocean
and surveying open sea and all the waves before you.
The characteristic features of the wave are its amplitude, A, its wavelength, λ (the distance between two
sequential peaks) and its frequency, f (the number of
oscillations per second, measured as Hertz [Hz] or
reciprocal seconds [s[�][1]]). The relationship between
these parameters, the cyclic frequency, v, and the
wavenumber, k, are illustrated in the Figure. Most
importantly the multiplication of the frequency with
the wavelength equals the speed of propagation, c.
Maxwell’s theory predicted that the speed of lightTagedP
(visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation)
would be constant at 186,000 miles per second, confirming a measurement first made on earth (rather than
by astronomical estimation as done by Ole Rømer and
published in 1676[21]) by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1848.[22]
The frequencies of oscillation of electromagneticTagedP
waves can range from fractions of Hertz (a slow


variation in field strength taking more than a second
to complete) to billions of times a second. Each frequency can be exploited technologically in different
ways and this is generally represented by the Electromagnetic Spectrum.

###### The electromagnetic spectrumTagedH2

Physicians utilize electromagnetic radiation (EMR)TagedP
in many forms. High-frequency, ionizing EMR is
employed for diagnosis (e.g., X-ray and CAT scan
imaging) and treatment (e.g., gamma-knife and other
ionizing radiation treatments for cancer; non-ionizing
ultraviolet radiation provides treatment of skin conditions such as psoriasis; infrared radiation is applied in
physiotherapy and intensive care), while pulsed EMR
are increasingly used in orthopedics and physical therapy. The electromagnetic spectrum includes visible
light that forms a sliver of the spectrum (Fig. 4), with
much of the remaining parts being invisible.
In public health, strong health and safety guidelinesTagedP
proscribe exposing infants and young children to the
sun’s rays beyond limited exposures. The problematic
rays are found in the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light in
the UVA and UVB frequency bands. While UVB is
traditionally associated with direct DNA damage that
leads to melanoma or less malignant forms of skin
cancer, recent evidence indicates that UVA plays a
greater role than previously assumed in the onset of
skin cancers and can affect the immune system and
other organs as well.[23] Other parts of the spectrum,
especially that of blue light at 440 nanometers are
used for their biological impacts on the skin to treat
hyperbilirubinemia[24] by stimulating the production of
di-hydroxy-vitamin D in the liver in jaundiced newborns. Untreated, the syndrome can result in bilirubin
concentrations that can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus a permanent disabling neu�
rologic condition. Blue light[25] is also known to
interfere with sleep by impeding the production of
melatonin, a natural hormone released by the pineal
gland that is a potent anti-oxidant and free radical
scavenger produced by sleeping in darkness.
Returning to the use of the spectrum for communica-TagedP
tion, the ability to transmit a travelling electrical field
across space cannot itself establish a communication
channel. For that to take place, information must be
encoded into that transmission. The ability to code
information on EMF was what Guglielmo Marconi

voice or music. This scheme, known as amplitudemodulated (AM) radio, dominated early radio and
television broadcasts. However, there is a drawback
with such a scheme in that only one operator can use
the same radio frequency at a time. For two-way AM
communication either, each side must wait for the
other to stop and ‘release’ the frequency (hence the
use of ‘over’ by radio operators) or there must be different carrier frequencies for each channel.
The first generation of cellular phones were littleTagedP
more than AM radio handsets working with 2 channel
communication (by using a protocol known as Frequency Division Multiple Access[27] (FDMA) and
transmitting to an antenna connected to the telephone
network, often using relatively high powers of EMF,
up to 5 Watts. Their transmissions could be famously
picked up by ham radio operators, as the future King
of England discovered to his chagrin, when an intimate
conversation between then Prince Charles and his paramour, Mrs. Camilla Parker-Bowles was recorded by a
scanner enthusiast.[28] Continuous analogue signals dominated telephone signals via copper wires that knitted
together cities and countries, radio and television
broadcasts right up until the early 1990s.
To overcome problems of limited exchange, andTagedP
avoid interference and the embarrassment of royals,


digital forms of transmission were introduced. The
simplest form of digitization is to modulate a carrier
signal, transmitting at a set frequency by multiplying
it by zero or one. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.
The first panel in the Figure shows the base sinusoi-TagedP
dal signal and is known as the “carrier frequency”.
The second panel is a digitization that turns on or off
the signal. The bottom panel is the result of multiplying the two together, resulting in bursts - pulses- of
transmission. A receiver tuned to the carrier frequency
will translate the red envelope into ones and zeros,
resulting in a digital series and information.

###### The increase in exposure to electromagneticTagedH2 radiation

The quantity of data transmitted wirelessly and itsTagedP
associated radiation have increased many orders of
magnitude since the inception of TV and radio programming. Rather than weekly anticipation of seeing
a star on the Ed Sullivan Show or the next stage of a
sitcom, we can now enjoy instant gratification with
binge-watching, and endless offerings on many platforms, with important environmental implications,[29]

including significantly increased energy and greenhouse gas emissions.

result of the fact that the 5G standard relies on a new
technological advance termed Multiple Input Multiple
Output (MIMO) antennas. The number of users that
can connect to a single base station increases by sharing out the frequency band to many more frequency
channels (hence the requirement for higher frequencies) and by dividing the time each individual channel
utilizes the same frequency band. In contrast to 2G to
4G standards, this division of frequency bands in 5G
is multiplied by using beam-forming antennas. By
using many small antennas and by closely timing individual transmissions on the same frequency, it is
possible to form the signal into a tightly confined
spatial beam from the base station directly to the
user’s 5G phone, 5G tablet or 5G computer. As
long as 2 users are not standing together, they can
both use the same signal frequency and not interfere with each other’s transmission. These are
known as “phased array antennas” and will form
the heart of multiple beam-forming antenna and the
need for MIMO in the 5G standard.[33] The electromagnetic frequencies utilized for wireless and cellular communications, from 1G up to 5G occupy
the Megahertz (MHz) and Gigahertz (GHz) frequency ranges as depicted in Table 1.

###### How is EMF exposure quantiTagedP fied?
The metric used for measuring personal exposureTagedP
from cell phones is called SAR (Specific Absorption Rate). It is a gauge of the rate of absorption of
electromagnetic energy by the flesh of the user.
Properly defined it is the rate of absorption of
energy from a cell phone or other wireless device,


measured in Watts per Kilogram (W/kg) averaged
over a time period of 6 or 30 minutes distributed
into a 1 g or 10 g volume within the plastic phantom 12-pound head of a large adult male filled
with homogenous fluid or his 220-pound plastic
body phantom. A local SAR of 1.6 W/kg is
allowed for head and torso, and 4.0 W/kg is permitted for extremities which include the ear (the
pinna).
Using a computer-controlled probe that dips into theTagedP
fluid-filled phantom head (see Fig. 6), the electromagnetic field strength is measured at various points inside
the model of 12-pound head of a large adult male. The
SAR is then calculated by the equation,


SAR
¼


2

s E
���� ����

1
ð Þ
r


where s is conductivity of the saline solution at the
frequency of interest, E is the electric field strength
and r is the density of the media. The protocol of measurement is dictated by the IEEE standard C95.12019.[38] The human phantom is known as the Specific
Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) and is standardized by the IEEE.[39] The SAR rating has been criticized as under-estimating absorption for smaller
persons and for children by a number of authors[40]

because the dimensions of the SAM are based on a
model of the 90[th] percentile of 1989 United States
military recruits.[41][,][42][,][38] The homogenized saline
liquid used to electrically mimic flesh cannot
account for the varied and widely differing conductivities and densities of different tissues of different
ages.[43] Underlying this model for estimating exposure is the assumption that the only harm that can
be caused by an electromagnetic wave is heating of
brain or body. In summary, if exposure heating
results in a rise in core body temperature of less
than 1 ˚C, then it is considered not hazardous.
Criticisms of the SAR are further discussed in Section 7 on the need to update regulatory limits.
A further metric is the Ambient Power DensityTagedP
(PD), measured in Watts per square meter or milliwatts per square centimeter. The ambient PD metric measures the flow of electromagnetic energy
per square meter from a distant source, such as a
cellphone base station. In the US the safety limit
for general public exposure to sources such as base
stations, is set at 10 W/m[2] (sometimes quoted
equivalently as mW/cm[2]).

body. Importantly, man-made RFR used in wireless
and medical devices can be modulated, polarized and
pulsed, which greatly influences and can alter their
ultimate impacts.[62][,][63] Electroceuticals constitute an
expanding field of clinical applications involving a
range of medical devices, from pain control in orthopedics to cancer treatment, biofeedback, and the use
of low-strength pulsed electromagnetic fields.[64] As
with pharmaceuticals, any agent that promotes healing
may also promote illness. It is therefore pertinent to
explore potential mechanisms of interaction between
tissues and electromagnetic waves.
An important division in the spectrum happens at aTagedP
frequency of approximately 10[15] Hz (wavelength
10[�][8] m). While Maxwell’s theory, as described above,
considers light as classical waves, modern quantum
theory embraces a dualism in considering light as both
a particle and concurrently as a wave.[65] One can consider an oscillating packet of waves confined spatially
and moving as one through space. This is known as a
photon and the energy it contains is proportional to
the frequency of its oscillation. As the frequency is
reduced and wavelengths get macroscopically longer
(the wavelength of visible light is measured in hundreds of nanometers, whereas of radio waves in the
MHz range the wavelengths are measured in hundreds
of meters) the quantum description of light is indistinguishable for the classical theory of Maxwell.
The energy inherent in a photon of light at frequen-TagedP
cies of UV and above is enough to cause the ionization
of biological molecules. That means that the absorption of the photon by the molecule can result in the
breaking of chemical bonds, leading to the destruction
of the molecule. Specifically for DNA such an occurrence can lead to the promotion of cancers. At frequencies of radio waves direct ionization of DNA or
other molecules cannot happen.

###### Physical mechanisms of the interaction of RFRTagedH2 and tissues

At the submicroscopic level molecules can beTagedP
regarded as collections of potentially charged atoms
held together by chemical bonds as they share electrons. RFR also affects atoms that tend to be charged;
either positively charged “cations” (sodium Na[+] or
calcium Ca[2+]for example) or negatively charged
“anions” (chloride Cl[-]). Consequently, bonds will
react to an external electromagnetic field, even if its


frequency is not high enough to lead to direct ionization. One can view such a perturbation as gently
“nudging” ions. Under certain conditions bonds can
change and form new chemicals. Indeed, microwaves
are used commercially to speed up and alter products
of chemical reactions using “microwave catalysis”.[66]

Dysfunctional chemical reactions can lie at the root of
many distinct forms of ill health for living organisms.

###### Biological pathways for non-ionizing effectsTagedH2

There are several pathwaysTagedP [67][�][71] that may be
involved in biological effects of RFR, including the
induction of ROS leading to oxidative stress, activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and induction
of heat shock proteins. One of the more accepted pathways to damage is the perturbation of Voltage Controlled Calcium Gates (VCCG) by pulsed EMF.[72]

VCCGs are an integral part of cell membranes that are
responsible for the transport of Calcium ions across
the cellular membrane for signaling and regulation of
the cellular homeostasis. In 2000 Panagopoulos et al.
concluded that the ELF EMF components of wireless
communication signals are a critical factor in understanding how exposures can lead to pathology.[72][,][73]

Repeated irregular gating of electro-sensitive ion
channels disrupts the cellular electrochemical balance
and homeostasis leading to the overproduction of
reactive oxygen species. The cascading effects of
repeated exposures can lead to numerous biological
endpoints including the weakening of cell membranes.
Disturbance in ROS homeostasis leads to a patho-TagedP
logical state[74] termed “oxidative stress”, which plays
an essential roles in regulation of cancer progression.
ROS are understood to regulate every step of tumorigenesis and have been found to be upregulated in
tumors; this can lead to aberrant signaling. In addition
to cancer, oxidative stress plays a role[75] in the development of many other chronic diseases, including diabetes and neurodegenerative syndromes. Reviews of
animal and cell studies consistently find even very
low non-ionizing EMF exposures are associated with
increased oxidative stress. Children whose immune
systems are still developing are more vulnerable to
these ROS effects.[76][,][77] In 2019 Lai found strong indications that exposure to static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields also affects oxidative
status in cell cultures and experimental animals.[67][�][72]

Children’s brain and body tissues have a higherTagedP
dielectric constant, a measurement of the ease with
which electromagnetic fields can move through different media. Peyman[83] documented how the young
brain has a higher dielectric constant due to the higher
water content and less developed myelin sheath. Bony
tissues also change over time depending on the degree
of mineralization of the bone matrix. The largest agedependent variation in dielectric properties is
observed in bone because as an animal grows, the
high water content of red marrow is transformed to
the high fat content of yellow marrow.
Every tissue in the body has unique dielectric prop-TagedP
erties. For example, the distinctive dielectric properties of normal and cancerous breast are being
employed to enhance detection of abnormal cells[84]

and to devise EMR-based treatments for the disease.[85]
Pregnancy, infancy and childhood are periods ofTagedP
critical susceptibility, especially for the brain, which
is developing rapidly.[86] Children have a faster rate of
neuronal cell growth and the fatty protective sheath of
myelin is not fully formed until the mid-20s.[87] Even
very low levels of an environmental exposure early in
development can have lifelong implications for neurodevelopment. Stem cells[88] are more active in children
and have been found to be more sensitive to wireless
frequencies than differentiated cells.[88]
Cell phones and wireless devices have premarket RFTagedP
emission tests using the large adult SAM model, with
an empty twelve pound head into which homogenous
fluid is poured. Devices are not tested using a child’s
smaller head and body, nor with models of pregnancy.[42] Devices are also tested at a distance from the
body, without direct contact between the antenna and
the body or skull. This is why most smartphones, WiFi devices and other wireless electronics have instructions, deeply buried in user manuals, which advise
that devices be kept at a distance from the body.

###### Reproduction and pregnancyTagedH1

 Reproductive capacityTagedH2

Several, but not all reviewsTagedP [89] of the effects of EMFs
on male and female reproductive function have identified numerous serious effects that occur at levels of


RFR that do not heat tissues. Gye and Park[90] and
Jangid et al.[91] present a number of in vivo and in vitro
experimental studies demonstrating that non-ionizing
nonthermal EMF exposure can alter cellular homeostasis, endocrine function, reproductive function, and
fetal development. Impacts on both male and female
reproductive parameters have been reported, including: male germ cell death, the estrous cycle, reproductive endocrine hormones, reproductive organ weights,
sperm motility, early embryonic development, and
pregnancy success.
Mechanisms that appear to be involved at the cellu-TagedP
lar level include increases in free radicals and calcium
ions [Ca[2+]] related to effects of EMFs, which lead to
cell growth inhibition, protein misfolding and DNA
breaks.
Reproductive parameters reported to be affected byTagedP
EMF include male germ cell damage and death.
Females may experience impacts on the estrous cycle
affecting ovarian follicles, reproductive endocrine
hormones and reproductive organ weights. Effects on
reproduction include impairments of early embryonic
development, fertilization, miscarriage and a variety
of pregnancy-related outcomes. As with other endpoints, experimental effects on reproductive function
differ according to frequency, polarity, wave-form,
strength (energy), and duration of exposure.
A robust body of research on the male reproductiveTagedP
system specifically has found decreased testosterone[92]

as well as impacts to sperm viability,[93] motility and
morphology[68][,][94][�][100] from current levels of RFR
resulting from use of cell phones or other devices.
The induction of oxidative stressTagedP [101] is understood to be
a key pathway of action that underlies the biological
impacts of RFR on the reproductive organs and also can
play a major role in the induction of cancer as discussed
below.[101] At the cellular level, increased free radicals
impact mitochondrial metabolism and affect nitric oxide
levels and antioxidant mechanisms.[102] RFR may alter
membrane transport and integrity, affecting ion (e.g.,
calcium) transport; these are among mediators of effects
of EMFs that lead to cell growth inhibition, protein misfolding and DNA breaks. See Fig. 10.[56][,][92]

kinase (MAPK). The MAPK pathway also has a tumor
promoting role. Chronic exposure to ROS can activate
various stress kinases (p38 MAP kinase), stimulate
the ERK pathway, and also lead to phosphorylation of
heat shock proteins (Hsp) that inhibit apoptosis,
thereby promoting survival of damaged cells and
carcinogenesis. Hsp can increase the permeability of
the blood-testis barrier and produce infertility.
RFR also can interfere with membrane calcium channels and promote cancer by stimulating ornithine
decarboxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine
synthesis.

offspring. Experimental and epidemiological evidence
indicates that prenatal impacts could range from
impaired oogenesis and spermatogenesis, to reduced
volume and number of brain pyramidal cells, other
serious neuronal impairments, ovarian dysfunction[103]

as well as increased DNA damage in multiple
organs[104] of offspring.
Damage to oocytes in female offspring can in turnTagedP
affect fertility as well as the health of following generations. Daily exposure of young Sprague-Dawley
female rats for 2 h of GSM radiation for 1 and 2
months produced inflammation and impairment of
ovarian function[103] consistent with endometritis, a
growing problem for young adolescents. Intergenerational impacts are increasingly being understood; a
2021 study of more than 200 mother-daughter-granddaughter triads, found that granddaughters of those
who had been in the top third of DDT exposure during
pregnancy had 2.6 times the chances of having an
unhealthy body mass index by their mid-twenties and

There is growing evidence that male-mediated factors

relating both to preconception and fertilization, as
well as prefertilization and perifertilization exposures
also play roles in determining health outcomes of
progeny. In addition, early-life RFR exposures have
been demonstrated to cause a range of negative
impacts on male and female reproductive health,
including damage to the testicular proteome[107] and
low birthweight. After a month of 4 h daily controlled
exposure to nonthermal levels of cell phone radiation,
signaling proteins in the rat testes and sperm production were significantly altered, indicating impaired
reproductive function and increased cancer risk.
Experimental studies are especially useful in under-TagedP
standing the roles of avoidable early-life environmental exposures on outcomes that affect children and
adolescents, since controlled human studies are unethical. As a result, most human studies that can be used
to clarify the impact of RFR are observational. Frequently, such studies are opportunistic, complex and
expensive, and also challenging to interpret with poor
quality longitudinal data, and limited exposure data,
particularly with evolving uses of ever-changing technologies. In the real world, children are exposed to
numerous sources of RFR at various frequencies and
modulations throughout their daily lives. Smart
phones can operate with 5 or more antennae simultaneously sending and receiving radiation to and from
towers or routers, as most apps are set to update automatically. Yet, most experimental studies only look at
a single frequency at a time.

###### Prenatal exposures and the central nervousTagedH2 system

Over the past two decades a number of experimentalTagedP
investigations have found that prenatal exposure to
some EMF negatively affects both the structure and
function of the adult central nervous system
(CNS).[108][�][110] As an example, a series of experiments
by Odaci, Bas and Kaplan and colleagues measuring
impacts through stereological analysis demonstrated
that rodents exposed prenatally to 900 MHz had fewer
cells and more indications of damage in various brain
regions of the hippocampus responsible for learning
and memory.[111] Likewise, studies on postnatal exposures of 8 week old rats also found impacts on hippocampal pyramidal cells.[112][,][113] This team also found
prenatal and postnatal impacts occurred to the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The cerebellum is critical to memory, balance and impulse control and


appears especially vulnerable to RFR. Others have
hypothesized that RFR might also alter the membrane
current of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum.
Haghani et al. evaluated properties of Purkinje cells[108]

following prenatal exposure to 900 MHz EMF and
found that exposed progeny had significantly reduced
spontaneous cell firing. While these areas of the brain
have been well characterized after prenatal EMF
exposure, it is likely that many other areas of the brain
are similarly affected.

###### Prenatal exposures in humans alter behaviorTagedH2 and cognition in offspring

Although they are few in number, human studiesTagedP
investigating in utero exposure to wireless and other
non-ionizing EMF have found a variety of adverse
effects on pregnancy outcomes as well as the health of
offspring regularly exposed to EMF or EMF/RF.
Several studies by a team from Kaiser PermanenteTagedP
lead by Dr. De Kun Li report a range of impacts to
pregnancy and offspring. They measured pregnant
women’s exposure to magnetic fields (MF) early in
pregnancy using an EMDEX Lite meter (Enertech
Consultants Inc.) that measures magnetic field MF
exposure for 24 h during a typical day, and providing
a detailed diary of activities to allow the researchers
to: (1) identify locations of daily activities (at home,
at home in bed, in transit, at work, and other); (2) verify if activities were reflective of a typical day; and (3)
examine if locations and activities were associated
with high MF exposure. Women and their progeny
were followed over several years. After controlling
for multiple other factors, they found that women who
were exposed to higher MF levels had 2.7 times the
risk of miscarriage compared to those with lower MF
exposure, a finding that corroborated earlier research
by the same team.[114] Later publications also found
higher in utero MF exposures associated with childhood obesity, asthma, and ADHD.[115][�][117] Similarly
designed research[118] that measured MF exposure with
the EMDEX meter found lower neural volume and
bud length, measured by ultrasound, in embryos of
women with higher workplace and other exposures to
EMF, who were seeking induced abortion of
unwanted pregnancies that were terminated in the first
trimester. Women in the top quartile of MF exposure
had a four-fold increased risk of a shorter embryonic
bud length than those in the bottom quartile.

effects to be able to discern whether common pediatrics complaints such as headaches and problems sleeping could, in fact, be due to the excessive use of
technologies in the home or school environment.
Clinicians encountering patients presenting with unexplained symptoms can consider the complete clinical
picture and health history, and investigate, treat if necessary, or exclude commonly recognized etiologies.


For example, patients may come into the office with
unexplained array of symptoms such as headaches
and rashes that may be related to EMF (e.g., cell
antennas recently mounted nearby, or upgraded school
Wi-Fi system recently installed). Clinicians need
greater awareness so that in differential diagnosis they

other unexplained symptoms attenuate in different
areas, but return chiefly when the child is in one specific location? Did headaches or symptoms begin
when a new router or cell antenna was installed?

As technologies (and healthier alternatives) evolveTagedP
and knowledge advances, there is a need for clinicians
periodically to update their knowledge through continuing medical education with technical experts in
bioelectromagnetics—a field that is not widely taught
or studied in medical schools at this juncture. Some

###### Synergistic and combined toxic exposures inTagedH2 children

Children are exposed to numerous combinations ofTagedP
environmental exposures over their lifetime. Even
where exposures are low, they can interact with each
other resulting in additive or synergistic results.
Animal and human studiesTagedP [219] indicate that non-ionizing EMF can act synergistically when combined
with other toxic agents. For example, Sueiro-Benavides et al.[220] found that 2.45 GHz, a frequency used
in Wi-Fi networks, combined with carbon black (CB)
increased CB-induced toxicity and prolonged inflammatory immune responses. Exposures to non-ionizing
EMF from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cell
phones has been found to enhance the release of mercury from dental amalgam.[221] RFR has been found in
several studies to impact the integrity of the bloodbrain barrier that protects the brain from toxic molecules circulating in the blood.[132][,][222][�][225]
A longitudinal studyTagedP [226] of 2,422 children at 27 elementary schools in 10 Korean cities examined effects
and interactions between voice call cell phone use and
blood lead levels (lead levels were comparable to
those in U.S. children). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder symptom risk was significantly greater in the
children with above-median lead levels and abovemedian weekly cell phone call duration.
A similar interaction was reported by Choi et al.TagedP [227]

Across the cohort, maternal cell phone use during
pregnancy was not associated overall with child neurodevelopment during the first three years. Among
children exposed to higher maternal blood lead level
in utero, however, a greater risk of both a poorer psychomotor development index and a lower mental
development index up to 36 months of age was associated with higher cell phone calling time or frequency
during pregnancy.

###### A theoretical role for RFR in the etiology ofTagedH2 autistic spectrum disorder

Autism remains a puzzling and troubling problemTagedP
for growing numbers of children, their families and
their physicians. The disease[228] is increasing among
both males and females, and among nearly all racial/
ethnic subgroups, from 4.2 per 1,000 in 1996 to 15.5
per 1,000 in 2010. A recent report from the U.S.


Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that
rates have continued to increase. The prevalence of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among 11 surveillance sites is 1 in 54 among children aged 8 years in
2016 (or 1.85%). This constituted a 10% increase
from 2 years previously when it was 1 in 59, and the
highest prevalence since the CDC began tracking
ASD in 2000. Consistent with previous reports, boys
were 4 to 5 times more likely to be identified with
ASD than girls. The rate for ASD is 1 in 34 among
boys (2.97 percent) and 1 in 145 among girls (0.69%).
Although many environmental factors[229] have been
posited, including air pollution, pesticides, and heavy
metals, the potential role of RFR should also be seriously explored.
Experimental studies showing that prenatal expo-TagedP
sures to RFR can disrupt the development of the hippocampus provide some foundation for speculating
that EMFs could also be a contributing factor. Thus,
RFR has plausibly been hypothesized to play a role in
the development of ASD via disruption of the developing poorly myelinated central nervous system.
When presented with serious behavioral disorders
including autism, some psychiatrists have employed
successful treatment protocols that involve family
management systems to facilitate cessation and withdrawal from use of digital devices. Psychiatrist Victoria Dunckley[192] notes that early use of digital devices
can create a heightened state of fight or flight among
young brains and bodies, placing them under constant
stress. Children are easily addicted to routines of falling asleep, eating and even using the toilet accompanied, not by parents soothing assurances, but by
digitized music, visions and sounds that increase
dopamine—the brain chemical tied with pleasure and
addictive behaviors. Providing several impressive
case reports of toddlers that had been out of control
and unable to give up their digital fixations,
Dunckley notes that digital fasting can yield
impressive results, especially with children on the
autism spectrum. Her book provides several
detailed instances where altering children’s access
to digital devices can radically improve behavior.
Other published reports also offer corroboration for
this hypothesized connection.[230][,][231]
Psychiatrist Martha Herbert and research analyst andTagedP
editor of the Bioinitiative Report, an ongoing record of
relevant scientific findings, Cindy Sage, among others,

have called for more aggressive investigation of the
possible connections between RFR uses and exposures and disorders on the autism spectrum. They
speculate that behaviors on the autism spectrum could
emerge from alterations of electrophysiological oscillatory synchronization and EMF/RFR could contribute and “worsen challenging biological problems and
symptoms; conversely, reducing exposure might ameliorate symptoms of ASD by reducing obstruction of
physiological repair.”[232][,][233]

###### Inadequate regulatory limitsTagedH1

FCC and ICNIRP regulatory limits have been longTagedP
criticized by experts and the court because they do not
address children’s unique vulnerability, the biological
and health effects of long-term exposure nor the current ways that children are exposed to cell phone and
wireless radiation. In 2012, the AAP wrote the FCC
and other federal agencies calling for an update to the

because ICNIRP and IEEE do not consider such
effects as “established.” As former ICNIRP member
James C. Lin describes them: “They are flawed and
are not applicable to long-term exposure at low levels.
Instead of advances in science, they are predicated on
misguided assumptions with outdated exposure metrics that do not adequately protect children, workers,
and the public from exposure to the RF radiation or
people with sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation
from wireless devices and systems. Thus, many of the
recommended limits are debatable and absent of scientific justification from the standpoint of safety and
public health protection.”[16]

effects of electromagnetic emissions or radiation.” TagedEnd
In contrast, the more strict RF limits in Russia andTagedP
China[238] are considered “science based,” not precautionary, and were developed based on their own government scientists’ studies of the biological effects of
nonthermal RFR levels. India lowered its limits to 1/
10 of ICNIRP limits in 2012[239] in response to a report
from an Inter-Ministerial Committee that reviewed
the research[240] on impacts to wildlife, including honeybees and other pollinating insects, and concluded[239]

that the “vast majority of published literature indicate
deleterious effects of EMFs in various species.” (See
Fig. 7 for comparisons) It is notable that other groups
have recommended even lower limits. For example,
the Ecolog Report, commissioned by T-Mobile and
Deutsche Telekom in 2000, reviewed the science recommended a limit of 0.01 W/m2 to” be rigorously
adhered to by all base stations near sensitive places
such as residential areas, schools, nurseries, playgrounds, hospitals and all other places at which
humans are present for longer than 4 hours.”[241]

###### Why the SAR standard is inadequate to protectTagedH2 children

Pre-market tests for cell phones and wireless devicesTagedP
measure the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which is
the standard accepted measurement of the rate of RF
(radiofrequency) energy absorption. (See Table 2.)
For cell phones and other handheld wireless devices,
many countries have adopted either FCC or the
ICNIRP limits for premarket RF compliance.
Although the FCC limit is slightly more restrictive
compared to ICNIRP limits, both rest on avoiding the
effects of heating as measured by the SAR.
The SAR metric is criticized as a heat-based measureTagedP
unable to capture[72] the numerous characteristics[242] of
nonthermal exposure considered relevant to bioeffects
such as pulse, modulation, variability or duration of exposure.
That said, even if the SAR was a valid measure forTagedP
health effects thresholds, the SAR testing protocol
itself has long been criticized as unrealistic for numerous reasons. To start, it does not take into account the
smaller sizes of women, infants and children, and
other properties of children that place them at greater
vulnerability. Thus, the child brain sits in a thinner
skull that contains more fluid which can absorb more


radiation per unit volume than the adult brain with its
thicker skull.
In regards to children’s exposure, the AAPTagedP [1] wrote
the FCC in 2012 noting that, “although wireless devices sold in the United States must ensure that they do
not exceed the maximum allowable SAR limit when
operating at the device’s highest possible power level,
concerns have been raised that long-term RF exposure
at this level affects the brain and other tissues and
may be connected to types of brain cancer, including
glioma and meningioma,” and also that, “The current
metric of RF exposure available to consumers, the
Specific Absorption Rate, is not an accurate predictor
of actual exposure.”
The head and body phantom are filled with a homog-TagedP
enous liquid that does not capture the way the electromagnetic field moves through different tissues in the
head such as brain tissue, which is of varying thicknesses and characteristics. The dielectric properties of
tissues in children’s head and brain differ from adults
because children’s tissues have more water content
and thus are more conductive than adults.
The SAM model has long been argued to provide aTagedP
conservative estimation of the exposure from a mobile
phone, even for children. However, research supporting
this position has generally used a scaled down version of
an adult head which did not account for all age dependent variations in children, such the anterior fontanels
which close between 7 and 18 months. When these more
realistic variations are accounted for, the SAR values for
children are significantly higher. For example,
Mohammed[243] used realistic head models in several scenarios simulating young children between 3 months and
18 months holding phones near their ear and mouth as
well as a person holding a mobile phone near a child’s
head. They found that 10g SAR values in the heads of
young children are significantly higher than those for
adults and also noticeably higher than the scaled models
used in previous studies that considered dosimetry for
children over 3 years old.
Research supporting the SAM modelTagedP [244] is based on
early phone models that were designed with antennas
on the top of the phone body and more recent research
has found that for newer phone models with antennas
integrated along the bottom of the phone, the SAM
does not always ensure[40] a conservative estimation.
Phones are tested while operating at the highestTagedP
power level, in specific positions against the phantom
head and body. Devices generally operate at the minimum necessary power, in order to maximize battery

life, but in many situations the power output is much
higher, to ensure reception at the receiving antenna in
the cellular base station. Low incoming signal strength
triggers a significant increase a phone’s emissions;
people encounter low signal strength in rural areas far
from base stations and also, for example, in rooms in
basements or buildings where building materials block
the signal. The many real world exposure scenarios
result in highly variable emissions from any one cell
phone model, regardless of the stated SAR value.
Although the standardized SAR test positions areTagedP
supposed to simulate the way people typically hold a
cell phone, the standardized positions do not test in
body contact positions for body SAR tests. The test
positions do not mimic a cell phone in full body contact such as in a pants pocket or resting against the
abdomen. Parents today often hold their newborns
with the cell phone right up against the baby and yet
premarket SAR tests do not include such positions.
In summary, the SAR test and SAM have been roundlyTagedP
criticized as underestimating and not adequately capturing the real world exposures of children, babies, and toddlers, and children who are positioned in direct or close
body contact with cell phones or other devices.
Furthermore, manufacturers SAR test phones at var-TagedP
ious distances from the body. In the U.S. a manufacturer can decide to test for body SARs at 5, or 10, or
even 25 mm. The measured SAR value will increase
the closer the phone is tested to the body phantom.
Thus, the manufacturer posted SARs of different models that use different separation distances cannot be
directly compared to each other.
Although SAR levels often are used to compare cellTagedP
phones in terms of which phone emits more RF than
others, the SAR value does not necessarily reflect a
difference in a consumer’s actual exposure for these
reasons. Hence a phone with a lower SAR level does
not necessarily mean lower RF exposure. Nonetheless,
the SAR is the metric in use and the basis for exposure
limits worldwide.

###### Regulatory gaps affecting childrenTagedH2

The AAPTagedP [1] has long advocated[1] that federal agencies
strengthen regulations calling for:

TagedEndTagedP[�] A reassessment of human exposure limits and testing
requirements to ensure children’s unique


vulnerabilities are addressed and to reflect the way
children use phones today in close proximity to the
body;

TagedP� Establishing a federal research program as the basis
for exposure standards;

TagedP� Cell phone and wireless device product labeling
requirements to “enable parents to better understand
the potential dangers of RF energy exposure and
protect their children.”

The AAP supportedTagedP [245] national legislation, the Cell
Phone Right To Know H.R. 6358,[246] proposed in
2012, which would have addressed numerous regulatory gaps in federal policy regarding stating that,
“Children are disproportionately affected by environmental exposures, including cell phone radiation. The
differences in bone density and the amount of fluid in
a child’s brain compared to an adult’s brain could
allow children to absorb greater quantities of RF
energy deeper into their brains than adults.”

###### Prevention: medical organization, publicTagedH2 health, government policy and actions to mitigate risk to children

Based on the established science, including child-TagedP

all aspects of control, monitoring, measuring and
remediating wireless radiation.
First, no federal agencies with health or environ-TagedP
mental expertise have reviewed the totality of the science to ensure U.S. regulations are adequate. In 2021
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia issued a landmark ruling in the case of
Environmental Health Trust et al. vs. the FCC[55] that
challenged the FCC’s decision not to update the
human exposure limits for RFR emissions from cell
phones, Wi-Fi, and cell tower networks. The Court
found that the FCC did not provide evidence of properly examining scientific evidence on the record and
had ignored studies indicating low level non-thermal
exposures could cause harm, especially for children.
The Court then ordered the FCC to provide a reasoned
explanation regarding these issues:

TagedEndTagedP� the impacts of wireless radiation on children;

TagedP� the health implications of long-term exposure to RF
radiation;

TagedP[�] the ubiquity of wireless devices and the technological developments since the FCC last updated its
guidelines;

TagedP� the cell phone radiation emission test methods that
use heat measurements and allow a space between
the phone and body; and


TagedP� the impacts of wireless radiation on the environment.

Another critical regulatory gap is that when consid-TagedP
ering cell tower network emissions, there is no U.S.
agency with health or environmental expertise
engaged in any funded activities regarding health
effects.
Unlike other countries that are gathering data viaTagedP
countrywide monitoring programs, the U.S. has no
active federal field measurement program for assessment, compliance, or enforcement regarding cell
tower and base station antenna RF emissions. The last
federal agency report on RFR measurements was
compiled in 1986 by the EPA.[265] When companies
apply to build a cell tower in the U.S. near a school or
homes, there are no requirements for real world RFR
measurements before and after the antenna facilities
are built, nor any requirement for annual measurements. The computer simulations provided by the
company do not always provide estimated RFR levels
for all of the areas that will be impacted by the cell
antenna installation, such as inside an apartment that
shares a wall with a building mounted antenna, or
inside the room of a school or home in direct line of
sight of the main beam of an antenna. Such close

proximity installations can result in increased RF
exposure[35][,][266][,][267] and are associated with various
EMF-related symptoms.[208][,][210]
Although several nations post online maps withTagedP
the location of cell towers and wireless facilities
alongside RFR measurements, U.S. federal agencies
neither collect, nor provide this information to the
public. For example, small cell wireless facilities
(such as those on poles less than 50 feet tall such
as street lamps) generally do not need to be registered with the FCC.

###### International marketing, compliance andTagedH2 transparency measures

Some countries have enacted a variety of regulationsTagedP
designed to minimize children’s exposure, ensure
compliance with cell phone regulations, and ensure
that the public has access to RFR information as
shown in Table 3. For example, since 2010 France has
prohibited the sale of cell phones designed for children under 6 years, and banned advertising cell
phones to children under 14 years. In 2015, their cell
phone labeling requirements were strengthened.
Advertising must clearly recommend how to reduce
exposure to the head or companies can be fined. In
2019, a joint order of the French Health and Finance
Agencies[268] ordered that the cell phone consumer
information should include several specific ways to
reduce RF exposure to the brain, minimizing frequency and duration of use. In addition, the cell phone
information includes “Keep radio equipment away
from the belly of pregnant women,” and “away from
the lower abdomen of adolescents.”[269]
2020 regulationsTagedP [270] now mandate that computers, tablets and other handheld wireless electronics (as well as
refurbished products) held close to the body were subject to the same labeling regulations as cell phones. In
2022, the French General Directorate for Competition,
Consumer Affairs and Fraud Prevention found numerous violations[271] of their labeling requirements for
wireless devices and issued over 200 warnings.


InTagedP 2014, Belgium implemented two Royal
Decrees[272] that prohibited the sale and advertising of
cell phones designed for children under 7 years old.[273]

###### Premarket cell phone and wireless device RFRTagedH2 testing

Some countries such as France and Canada performTagedP
independent SAR measurements of cell phone models
to ensure regulatory compliance. Both countries have
found that some phone models exceed their regulatory
limits, even when tested at the manufacturer’s stated
separation distance, i.e. 5 or 10 or 15 mm from the
head or body.
So far, over 35 non-compliant phone models haveTagedP
been either withdrawn from the French market or had
software updates to decrease the RFR. The French
National Frequency Agency, ANFR, posts their independent SAR test measurements for hundreds of cell
phones online.[274] The U.S. does not have an oversight
program for cell phone RFR emission compliance.
Furthermore, all cell phones and Wi-Fi devices suchTagedP
as routers, speakers, and gaming consoles have fine
print instructions in their manuals stating that the user
should maintain a specified minimum distance
between their body and the phone or device in order
to ensure compliance with regulatory safety limits.

###### Schools and child care settingsTagedH2

France, Israel, and regions in Belgium have removedTagedP
Wi-Fi from kindergarten classrooms and restricted
exposures in elementary classrooms. See Table 4. For
example, French law (2015)[275] stipulates that Wi-Fi
be off as the default setting, so that it is only turned on
if needed for a particular classroom activity. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
(PACE) Resolution 1815[276] (2011) recommends that
“for children in general, and particularly in schools
and classrooms, give preference to wired Internet connections, and strictly regulate the use of mobile
phones by school children on school premises.”

In the U.S., there are no specific school-focused orTagedP
workplace-based federal regulations for RFR exposures. The Maryland State Children’s Environmental
Health and Protection Advisory Council report on WiFi in school[277] recommends the reduction of RFR
exposures in schools “as much as feasibly practical.”
Clegg et al.[278] outlines how to minimize RFR in buildings and includes the Collaborative for High Performance Schools[279] criteria to reduce RFR and ELF
EMF in classrooms. (See a summary of recommendations below.)
Recommendations by Maryland Expert AdvisorsTagedP
to the Governor and the Collaborative For High
Performance Schools include:

TagedEndTagedP� Install and use wired local area network (LAN) for
internet access instead of Wi-Fi and connect classroom tech with cables whenever possible and
always when building/remodeling.

TagedP� Ensure devices (tablets and laptops) are always used
on a desk, not lap.

TagedP� Laptops, tablets and notebooks should have an
Ethernet port and a physical switch to disable all
wireless radios at once.

TagedP� Cell phones should be powered off and stored away
during the school day. Wireless wearables should be
turned to airplane mode.

TagedP� Prohibit use of DECT and cordless phones.

TagedP� Corded telephones should be installed in every
classroom and there should be a way that students
can contact parents and make calls during the day
for planning purposes.

TagedP[�] Schools should integrate education on why and how
to reduce RFR exposure into elementary, middle
and high school class curriculum.

TagedP� Cell towers and wireless facilities should not be
built on or adjacent/near to school property.

TagedP� Measure ELF and RFR levels in classrooms and
sports areas yearly and when new technology is
added to classrooms.

###### Healthcare settingsTagedH2

Sources of non-ionizing EMF exposure inside hospi-TagedP
tals and healthcare facilities come from both the wireless networks (RFR) as well as electrical medical
equipment (ELF-EMF).
EMF levels in neonatal units have been the subjectTagedP
of research due to the elevated exposure to an


especially vulnerable patient group. Measurements of
ELF inside incubators can range from 2 to 100 mG,
depending on the distance from the top of the mattress
to the electrical equipment.[280] After documenting
higher levels of low frequency EMF levels inside
closed incubators as compared to the ambient levels
in the room, Penn State Medical Center researchers
moderated the exposure through a grounding technique and found the mitigation improved infant’s
vagal tone, a marker of vulnerability to stress, and the
risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis.[281]
RFR in neonatal intensive care units primarily origi-TagedP
nates from staff and families’ use of cell phones and
wireless devices. A prudent avoidance strategy is recommended because these newborns are particularly
vulnerable.[282]
In 2017, in Israel measurements of magnetic fieldTagedP
EMF were taken for incubators in neonatal units at the
request of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of
Environmental Protection[283] and they found a range
from 0.05 to 5 mT. The Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection identified manufacturer approved
efficient shielding methods to mitigate exposure in
incubators and recommends reducing the duration of
exposure as much as possible and prioritizing the use
of low EMF incubators.
In Cyprus, the National Committee on EnvironmentTagedP
and Children’s Health, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, worked with the Archbishop Makarios
III Hospital to pilot an RFR reduction program[284] in
the pediatric intensive therapy unit and neonatal units.
They removed the Wi-Fi access points, installed wired
LAN networks and launched a multimedia educational
program for families. RFR levels were measured before
and after the mitigation and the measures resulted in a
significant reduction in ambient exposure in the units.
The Agaplesion Diakonie Hospital in Hamburg,TagedP
Germany has designed two “environmental” rooms
for people with multiple chemical sensitivities and/or
environmental allergies including sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. In addition to using low VOC
emission building materials and fragrance free cleaning, several measures have been taken to reduce exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields including
the installation of power circuit breakers and prohibition of the use of cell phones.[285]
Recommendations for healthcare settings to min-TagedP

sensitivities:[13][,][83][,][197][,][199][,][215][,][275][,][281]

Modern telecommunications have been embracedTagedP
for their innumerable benefits to society, but we have
been slower to acknowledge the need to avoid and
reduce harms to youngsters or to the natural world on
which our lives depend.[286] Fortunately, alternatives to
employing wireless devices can provide safer, faster
and more efficient technical performance for many
modern applications. There are many distinct physical, psychological and sociological grounds for moderating children’s screen time to promote healthy
development. The principle of ALARA—as low as
reasonably achievable—ought to be adopted as a strategy for RFR health and safety protection.
While such measures are being implemented in clin-TagedP
icians’ offices, clinics and the like, there is a critical
need for an independently funded training, research
and monitoring program to identify major data gaps in
the field which are substantial, to set relative priorities
for research and training, and to conduct long term
studies of the physical and psychological impacts of
rapidly changing technological milieu, including ways
to mitigate impacts through modifications in hardware
and software.
The medical community has a critical role to play inTagedP
the prevention and treatment of EMF associated illness. Steps that doctors and other healthcare professionals can take include:

TagedEndTagedP� Federal level: Advocate with the AAP and other
health professionals for a reassessment of RFR


exposure limits and the development of standards
that adequately address biological impacts, children’s vulnerabilities and current use patterns.

TagedP� State level: Engage membership with educational
and training activities as well as resolutions to support federal initiatives.

TagedP� Support policies that reduce EMF exposure for children in home, child care, school, health care, and
recreational settings.

TagedP� Support the continued development of clinical
guidelines for prevention, treatment and diagnosis
of EMF related illness.
