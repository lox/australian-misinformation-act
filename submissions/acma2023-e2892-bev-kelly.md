I am wanting to voice my disgust at the proposal of the above bill. I oppose any form of censorship in Australia so do not
support this legislation.
This is yet another ploy by the “government “ to silence any opinion but their own. For many years the government and their
fellow corporations including the corporate media, have fed the people lies and propaganda in attempt to control the people
and this has become more evident over the last 3 years during the “pandemic “. Everyone has a right to have their voice
heard and just because their truth is not the same as the mainstream it does not make it wrong. People are quite capable of
hearing all sides to a topic and using their own critical thinking skills to make their own decisions. Taking away freedom of
speech and enforcing censorship on differing ideas is a tactic used by a fascist regime not what you would expect in a
democracy!
It is laughable that the government and media will be exempt from this bill considering that for the last 3 years they have
been the ones spouting lies, misinformation and disinformation.
I heard a quote recently ‘Censorship is the tool used when the lie loses its power’. I think this just about says it all.
Thank you for taking time to read this. I wish for this email to be considered a submission and I consent to the contents being
made public.
