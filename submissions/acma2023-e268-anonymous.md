To whom it may concern,

I am writing to give my feedback on the proposed Communications
Legislation Amendment Bill 2023.

I have so many grave concerns for any further government control of
information, that I can not find sufficient words for how much I oppose
this bill.

The last 3 years have been a massive wake up call to the already
extensive overreach of government powers and control of our lives. If
the government has any genuine concerns about misinformation, might
I sugest they take a more democratic approach by encouraging vibrant
debate rather than shutting down and controlling conversations and
their content. One can't help feeling that such a response is somewhat
tyrannical and wise to avoid, should the past be anything to go by.

As to giving any one government department the right to be the ones
to determine what is truth and what is "misinformation" has got to be
some crazy joke on the Australian population. That you are hoping to
award those that tell us that biological men can become women, the
right to be the arbitrators of all that is truthful, no debate allowed, has
got to be joke, right? Please tell me this is a massive joke. How could it
possibly be anything else?

Thank you so much for considering my feedback on this issue.

Kind regards,

Confidential information

I am happy for my submission to be made public, but please keep my
name anonymous.

I respectfully request that I am protected from this
outcome.
Many thanks,
