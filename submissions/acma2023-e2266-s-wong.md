A recent court judgement in Louisiana has found the US government guilty of blocking information related to
Covid-19 from the general public through social media censorship by labelling such information as misinformation,
even though the information was from leading frontline medical professionals and scientists with the highest
credentials.

This is a showcase of attacking free speech to the detriment of the general public and it should not be allowed, nor
should the Australian misinformation bill become law to attack freedom of speech and expression!!

**"The purpose of free speech...is to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will**
**ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolisation of the market, whether it be by**
**government itself or private licensee," Judge Terry Doughty wrote.**

We believe good science is built on debate with opposing voices and not to be monopolized by certain groups
selected by those in political power. Patients' health will have better outcome when physicians are free to treat
patients according to their individual circumstances without bureaucratic pressure.

It seems the sources of misinformation does not necessarily come from the general public. The exemption this bill
gives to the government and the main stream media is a double standard and is not justifiable.

If the government is serious about getting truth, it may do well by welcoming different ideas and encouraging
meaningful debate,
but not stifling free critical thinking and free expression of opinion.

Sadly, the so-called online fact checking operation has shown to be problematic as it has been revealed in the
United States court to actually be a misnomer for “narrative reinforcing”.

This legislation is even proposed by a democratically elected Government is beyond comprehension.

If we are to remain a free country where the real truth, not ‘The Narrative’, should set us free, this bill must be
rejected.


I confirm that my submission to be published.


Thank you!
