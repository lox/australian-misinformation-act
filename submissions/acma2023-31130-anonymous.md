# I strongly oppose any form of censorship in Australia. I do not support the governments legislation ‘Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023’

 This tyrannical overreach by the commonwealth government to dictate what can and cannot be voiced on social media platforms is removing the freedom to Free Speech and suppresses any debate on any topic they deem misinformation.

 In a democratic country the answer to controversies is not censorship but debate.

 This legislation will destroy democracy and open the door to dictatorship and communistic censorship. No one will be allowed to oppose the views set by those in power.

 Australia already has laws that protect people from hate speech and threats.

 ACMA is an unelected organisation that does not answer to the people of Australia and should not have the power to discern what is misinformation and disinformation.

 The government of the day does not have the right to suppress opposing views that do not align with their dictates.  

 I absolutely oppose any laws which will restrict the peoples right to communicate freely on any issue on any platform.
