The Democratic system is supposed to protect freedom of speech.

I am a chemical engineer, and have found the recent rise in censorship extremely alarming. Science
cannot flourish without debate, and it is unscientific to not have discussion or debate. Humans are
fallible, so it is not right to be forced into a single narrative. We should always encourage further
review and curiosity.

We need to have actual transparency, and not censorship. This proposal falsely claims that
censorship will protect the people. When in fact it is the exact opposite â€“ censorship is about power
and control over the people. Censorship goes hand-in-hand with authoritarian rule, so I strongly do
Not support this.
