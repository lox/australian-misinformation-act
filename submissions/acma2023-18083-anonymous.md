Subject: Opposition to the Communications Legislation Amendm
tion) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my strong opposition to the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023, which is currently under consideration. I believe that the proposed legislation raises
significant concerns regarding freedom of expression and the potential for unintended
consequences.

While I understand the need to combat misinformation and disinformation in today's digital
landscape, I believe that the measures outlined in the bill are excessive and pose a threat to
fundamental democratic values. Below, I would like to outline some of my key concerns:

1. Freedom of Expression: The proposed legislation, as it stands, appears to infringe upon
the freedom of expression. While combating misinformation is important, it should not
come at the cost of stifling open dialogue and diverse opinions. It is crucial to strike a
balance between addressing harmful content and protecting the right to express oneself
freely.
2. Complexity of Content Exemptions: The bill's provisions regarding content exemptions
are overly complex and could result in confusion and inconsistency in their application.
It is essential to ensure that any exemptions are clearly defined and do not inadvertently
restrict legitimate speech or investigative journalism.
3. Scope of the Private Message Exemption: The scope of the private message exemption
needs further clarification and refinement. It is important to delineate between private
conversations and public dissemination of harmful content while respecting the privacy
and autonomy of individuals.

4. Size of Penalties: The bill proposes substantial penalties for non-compliance, which
could have a chilling effect on digital platform services and discourage innovation.
Instead of punitive measures, it would be more effective to focus on education, media
literacy, and fostering responsible digital citizenship.

I respectfully request that you reconsider the provisions outlined in the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. While it is
crucial to address the challenges posed by misinformation and disinformation, I urge you to
ensure that any legislation strikes a balance between accountability and safeguarding the
principles of free expression and individual privacy.

Thank you for considering my concerns. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the potential
implications of the proposed legislation and take into account the views of concerned citizens
like myself. I am eager to see a robust and inclusive public discourse on this matter.

Yours sincerely,


-----
