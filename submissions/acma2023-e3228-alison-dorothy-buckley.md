I oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 on
the grounds that:
The government and mainstream media are exempt, this is discriminatory. Over the recent ‘health emergency in
Australia, all the governments and mainstream media were the source of lies, propaganda, and misinformation that
reinforced tyrannical, ineffective, and damaging policies such as lockdowns, masks, mandated injections, school
closures, and business shutdowns. Instead of controls on citizens we need a parliamentary enquiry into the loss of
human rights and freedoms and subsequent abuses forced on citizens.
This proposed Bill embodies the sort of restrictions that have occurred in totalitarian states like North Korea and
Stalin’s Russia. It undermines freedom of speech by attempting to pit that fundamental right against the notion of
combatting so-called ‘misinformation’. Fundamental rights are stand alone, weakening of them by any other laws is
denial of foundational democratic principles.
Defining misinformation is entirely subjective. No government or non-government agency, especially a small group of
mainly young people called ‘ACMA’, the Australian Communications and Media Authority is capable of doing this
democratically; so much power in the hands of so few has proven dangerous to the very survival of nations, such as
Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia.
Such excessive power will lead to censorship of the type that occurred in the recent ‘health emergency’, when
opposition to government information was suppressed or denied, and citizens were punished for attempting to provide
alternative information. Australians who are aware and broadly informed do not need more of their rights and
freedoms removed, they need to be able to fully exercise them peacefully, critically, and constructively.
Sincerely
Alison Dorothy Buckley on the Electoral Roll , 20th August, 2023,
