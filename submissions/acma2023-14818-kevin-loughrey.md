**THE “INDUSTRIAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY” LIED TO US ABOUT COVID-19**
**AND mRNA INJECTIONS**
**COULD THIS SAME ENTITY BE LYING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?**
By LtCol Kevin Loughrey(Ret’d), BE Mech(Hons), Grad Dip Strategic Studies(ANU)

**Introduction**
I shall answer the title’s question immediately by saying, “Yes”. In this short opinion piece I shall
explain why I am suspicious this is indeed the case.

**The Alleged Cause of Global Warming**
It is asserted by some scientists that Carbon Dioxide(CO2), Nitrous Oxide(N2O) and Methane(CH4)
are catastrophically warming the atmosphere. Based on this assertion, these scientists, and those
politicians and people who are adherents of this belief, demand that mankind dramatically reduce
the emissions of these gases. In the agreements reached so far, major emitters of these gases such
as Communist China and India are exempt from these restrictions.

But what if the earth’s atmosphere is not warming but instead cooling? Would this not put an end to
this thesis given that the concentration of CO2 has been rising steadily for around a century?

**Data taken from Ice Cores show no Correlation between CO2 and Atmospheric Temperature**


_Figure 1: As CO2 Concentration increases, Atmospheric Temperature decreases_


Figure 1 shows that temperatures and CO2 concentration extracted from ice cores shows that there
is no correlation between CO2 concentration and the temperature of the atmosphere.

**Raw Data from Numerous Climatology Networks all show the same Trend – Downwards!**
Here are a series of plots of raw temperature data taken from weather stations of long standing
around the world that have not been encroached upon by urbanisation; something that would

artificially exaggerate the real situation with respect to the atmospheric temperature close to earth’s
surface.


_Figure 2: Australia - 1885-2019_


According to Figure 2, from 1885 to around 1998, Australia’s climate has been cooling. After 1998,
the temperature record is broken because the Bureau of Meteorology:

  - replaced the analogue measuring systems with digital technology,

  - used digital equipment incapable of reading temperatures
below -10C,

  - did not run the two systems in parallel so that the digital
system could be calibrated against the analogue and thereby
ensure that temperature comparisons would be from the
same reference base,

  - put the new equipment in smaller housings (called
Stevenson Screens) causing them to record a higher
temperature, and

  - painted the insides of the boxes black so that they radiate
onto the measuring equipment – once again causing higher

_Figure 3: A Stevenson_

temperatures to be registered.

_Screen_

Was this incompetence or was it a deliberate ploy to gain
Government grants?
So what about the rest of the world? Figures 4 to 9 show the same trend. Temperatures have been
on a gradual decline whilst the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily rising.

**The Chances of this being an error are Zero!**
Given that these temperature measuring networks recorded their data in isolation of each other
because of the lack of global communications in those days, it is an impossibility that they could all
be wrong. How is it then, that we are constantly being told that the world will end in a fireball
when all historical data shows exactly the opposite?!

**A Congregation of the Evil and Wicked**
What you are seeing is very similar to what you saw with the lies promulgated about COVID-19.
COVID-19 (alpha) was a disease that was no more dangerous than Influenza if people were given
early treatment with a range of low cost medicines. But the use of these treatments was bizarrely
banned by Western Governments worldwide! Doctors have been denied the opportunity to properly
care for their patients and many have been deregistered for speaking out. Millions of people have
died unnecessarily. The wealthy elite have greatly increased their fortunes whilst the middle class
and the poor have been further impoverished.

Interestingly, the same people involved in the Climate Change movement were behind COVID-19.
These are:

   - large financial institutions with massive investments
in the Pharmaceutical Industry but also in
“renewable” energy technology.

   - The World Economic Forum, an organisation aiming
to destroy Western economies so that there can be “A
Great Reset”.

   - People who just generally hate humanity and believe
the world’s population should be culled.

   - The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), a huge
criminal cabal that wants to be the dominant power
of the world by 2049, the 100[th] year of the reign of
the CCP of China. The CCP has benefited hugely

_Figure 10: Electricity Cost and effect_

from “Climate Change”. Nearly all renewables

_of Injection of Renewable Power_

hardware is purchased from China and they have not
had to reduce their emissions at all so their electricity is 5 times cheaper than most countries
comprising the Western economies.

Figure 10 shows that there is a direct correlation between the cost of electricity in Australia and the
injection of intermittent power from appliances like roof top solar and windmills. The cost of
_electricity has risen by more than 7 times the Consumer Price Index whilst, all the time, the_
_Australian public has been assured that renewable energy would be cheaper. Clearly it is not!_

Cheap reliable energy is the foundation stone of any modern society. With energy costs many times
greater than that of Communist China, Australia is well on the way to being both impoverished and
vulnerable to take-over by foreign interests.

**The Path to Salvation**
It would be comparatively simple to rectify what has happened:
1. Abolish all subsidies related to energy generation of any sort.
2. Abolish any regulations that mandate in any way the use of “renewables” and “renewable”
energy.
3. Revert back to the way that electricity was generated before 2007. It is madness to inject
power intermittently into a power grid.
4. Explore the feasibility of placing modular nuclear reactors, based on the latest proven
technology, at all existing coal fired power stations. (If this were practical, the cost and time
needed to transition to nuclear technology would be far, far less than building new base-load
power generating facilities, based upon nuclear technology, from scratch.)

If we fail to do this, the future for our children, grandchildren and their successors looks extremely
bleak.

**See Distribution List**

**A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER**
**PREMIERS AND CHIEF MINISTERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,**
**CONCERNING THE GROSS MISMANAGEMENT, MALFEASANCE AND**
**PROPAGANISING OF COVID-19**

We write to you to express our grave concern about the handling by Government agencies at all
levels within the Commonwealth of Australia of the disease and virus known as COVID-19 and
SARS-CoV2 respectively.

As at the time of writing, the average age of death from this disease in Australia according to
statistics provided at https://www.health.gov.au/resources/covid-19-deaths-by-age-group-and-sex is
79.2 years for males and 83.7 years for females. COVID-19 poses virtually no danger to anyone
below the age of 70 who is medically fit. This is especially the case both for the young and even
the elderly if preventatives and treatments, including vitamin D, vitamin C, Ivermectin,
Hydroxychloroquine and zinc, were communicated and made available. If early treatment and
proven effective therapeutics had been adopted early in the pandemic, many loved ones, especially
the elderly would be still alive today.

Further facts which put into context the limited threat SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 poses the
community are:
1 The majority of the persons who have died from this disease in Australia were suffering
from serious, life-threatening comorbidities.
2 It is probable that many of these persons died with SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 not directly
because of it. We are suspicious that the number of deaths attributed to
SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 have been deliberately inflated so as to instil fear and panic into
the public in order to encourage them to seek ‘vaccination’ as their only salvation. Inflation
of these figures was achieved not only by wrongly attributing the cause of death to COVID19 but also by a testing regimen which was over-amplified so as to give a large number of
false positives.
3 Because of protocols enforced by public health officials and agencies, all patients that have
died were not given life-saving medicines in the first week of contracting this disease. This
has been further reinforced by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration
unreasonably prohibiting the use of low-cost, safe drugs that have proven to be very
effective in treating SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 in its early stage.

Despite the fact that this disease, properly treated, poses no significant threat to the health of the
general public, there has been, in our opinion, a concerted campaign of misinformation and
disinformation to create in the minds of the public and politicians exactly the opposite impression.
There has also been a deliberate campaign to deny Australians access to early treatment using
therapeutics which a large number of doctors, who have successfully cured thousands of suffers of

Page No 1 of 6 Revised 21 Oct 2021 KAL


-----

SARS-CoV2/COVID-19, attest are effective. These same therapeutics have been wrongly
disparaged by the media, certain politicians and public health officials.

Specifically, here is a list of some of the medicines which we know to be safe and highly effective
when administered, as deemed appropriate to the patient's circumstances, by a qualified medical
practitioner, in sequenced combinations:

1 Hydroxychloroquine,

2 Ivermectin,

3 Quercetin,

4 Azithromycin,

5 Doxycycline,

6 Soluble Zinc Salt,

7 Vitamins C & D,

8 Anticoagulants appropriate for the patient's medical circumstances,

9 Fluvoxamine,

10 Colchicine,
11 Prednisone, and
12 Melatonin.

(The foregoing list is not exhaustive but contains most of those medicines that have been found,
from extensive front-line experience, to be highly effective in treating SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 in
the early stage of the disease.)

We are of the opinion that the administration of these medicines by a qualified medical practitioner
as soon as symptoms of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 present, will result in a reduction of
hospitalisation by at least 85%. In other words, if indeed there have been 1,590 deaths as a
consequence of COVID-19, as at the time of writing, it is possible that greater than 1,300 persons
have died unnecessarily as a consequence of the TGA refusing to allow the early treatment of
patients with the above medicines (and others as appropriate).

It is our opinion that, if these medicines had been allowed, then the risks, attendant with the use of
COVID-19 vaccines, which have not been thoroughly tested in accordance with past standards,
would not have been warranted. These COVID-19 vaccines are, in our opinion, unacceptably
dangerous. We believe they have been responsible for hundreds of deaths and tens of thousands of
serious injuries in Australia. It is also likely there will be long-term ill effects from these vaccines.
Determining the exact number of deaths and injuries is made exceptionally difficult due to a failure
by the public health authorities to disambiguate counting methods and because of opaque criteria.
Specifically, the immunological and general medical health state of the person to be vaccinated was
not established prior to vaccination, nor is there any sort of rigorous, periodic check of persons after
they have been vaccinated in order to determine if there has been a change in the injected person’s
health state. In a similar vein, should a person die within 12 months of being vaccinated, there is no
set program of autopsy to properly ascertain the cause of death and record this data in case a pattern
of likely injury, which could be attributed to the effect of the vaccination, becomes apparent.

It is our opinion that banning low-cost therapeutics, both as a prophylactic and as early treatment
protocols, and instead recklessly promoting the use of COVID-19 vaccines which have
subsequently been shown to be unacceptably harmful to public health, amounts to gross
incompetence on the part of those involved. Indeed, the actions of these persons are, in our opinion,
worthy of a transparent investigation by an appropriate authority for the purposes of eventual
judicial action.

There are other matters associated with the handling of this medical emergency that are also worthy
of comment. These are:

1 The long-term wearing of masks by the public:

   - poses a psychological and physiological health hazard to the wearers,

   - instils unnecessary alarm in the public, and

   - is totally ineffective in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and therefore does far more harm

to the public than any imagined benefit it might confer.

2 As but one of many examples worldwide, the continuing rise of cases in Victoria while
undergoing severe lockdowns coupled with the increase in drug-addiction, breakdown of
marriages, destruction of small business, the interruption of education services at all levels
and a significant increase in mental health illness, confirm that lockdowns are both
detrimental to society and ineffective in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

3 We are of the opinion that mask wearing and lock-downs are being used, not to control the
disease, but to cause anxiety and distress, thereby encouraging everyone to submit to a
COVID-19 vaccination.

4 Mass COVID-19 vaccination of the public is absolutely the wrong thing to do when trying
to bring a disease such as this under control. It will do a great deal more harm than good
because it will give rise to variants which will likely be resistant to the vaccines being used.

5 It has been conclusively established that persons who contract and recover from SARSCoV2/COVID-19 have a broad and enduring immunity to the disease and its variants. This
immunity has been found to be significantly superior to that which is conferred by
vaccination.

6 Latest data suggests that persons who are vaccinated still contract, spread and die from this
disease; possibly in greater numbers than those that are not. It therefore makes no sense that
persons involved in the health services, the military or the police forces should be
compelled to be vaccinated.

We strongly recommend that you:

1 institute a protocol of prophylaxis and early treatment using the medicines that we have
listed plus any others that qualified medical practitioners feel are appropriate for the
patient's circumstances,

2 cease interfering in the patient-doctor relationship but help doctors share their knowledge
and experiences for the greater good,

3 cease immediately the vaccination of the public using these experimental COVID-19
vaccines until they have been thoroughly tested in accordance with long-accepted test and
evaluation standards,

4 per 3 above, prohibit any sort of mandate, either in Government or in business, that would
coerce people into submitting to vaccination,

5 provide isolates of SARS-CoV2 for national and international scrutiny and provide the
specimens tested by PCR for full confirmatory sequence analysis so as to quantify the
accuracy of these tests,

6 take the required action to dismiss those persons who have been responsible for this
unsatisfactory state of affairs, both as advisers and public health officials, and

7 appoint a Royal Commission with the broadest possible terms of reference to investigate the
Government's handling of this pandemic, including but not limited to:

     - lock-downs,

     - border closures,

     - mask and vaccine mandates,

     - the role of the media,

     - the role of advisory committees and individuals not members of the public service, and

     - why life-saving therapeutics and early treatment were denied the Australian public.

LtCol(Ret'd) K. A. Loughrey

6 January 2022

**See Distribution List**

**REQUEST FOR EACH ODPP LISTED BELOW TO FORMALLY INVESTIGATE**
**THE POSSIBILITY OF MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER, OFFICIAL MALFEASANCE**
**AND RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION**

**PURPOSE**
1. The purpose of this letter is to:
a. bring to your attention my suspicions that, here in Australia, there has been murder,
manslaughter, official malfeasance and reckless endangerment committed by politicians,
public-health bureaucrats and contracted consultants/advisers to the Government on the
matter of COVID-19, at the highest levels of the Federal, State and Territory
Governments; and
b. request that your office urgently assign a specialist police task force within your
jurisdiction to ascertain whether these suspicions have substance.

**BACKGROUND**
**The COVID Medical Network**
2. Because of my military background and my intense interest in this matter, I have become
involved with an eclectic group of world-renowned specialists in medicine, virology, immunology
& microbiology, engineers, scientists, legal practitioners and concerned citizens called, “The
COVID Medical Network”. In connection with this, I developed the enclosed letter (Enclosure A)
which was sent by registered mail to the 33 addressees provided in its distribution list.
Approximately four months have elapsed since that letter was dispatched. I have not received a
single reply. I have therefore decided to commence the 2[nd] phase of this operation to bring this
unsatisfactory state of affairs to a conclusion and to see those responsible for what I believe are
criminal offences and crimes against humanity brought before the courts.

**FACTS**
3. The enclosed letter (Enclosure A) provides an excellent background adumbration of the facts
pertaining to this matter and a framework for the expression of my concerns. In addition to that, by
way of a further background briefing, I recommend you watch:

4. At the core of my concerns, expressed in paragraph 1.a above, is the fact that the Australian

public have been deliberately denied access to life-saving early treatments for COVID-19 based on
highly-effective, low-cost, readily-available therapeutics and that, as a consequence of this, over
1,000 Australians have needlessly died of this disease. Similarly, I suspect health authorities have
deliberately not informed the public of medicines, such as Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin,
Quercetin, Vitamin D, Zinc salts and Vitamin C that provide some level of prophylaxis against this
disease[1].
5. Related to this, Australia has accrued a National Debt of greater than $1 trillion, businesses,

particularly small businesses, have been disrupted and a number of them irrevocably ruined, civil
rights have been trampled upon, society has been destabilised with mental illness and marriage
breakups and the population has been coerced, through mandates and restrictions of their liberty and
livelihoods, into submitting to a series of injections of substances that have not been subjected to
proper testing before being forced upon the whole Australian population.  This has resulted in
hundreds of deaths and many tens of thousands of injuries; a significant number of which will leave
people with permanent and even life-threatening disabilities.
6. As per the enclosed paper and recommended video interviews, this suspected criminal activity

was motivated by the desire to impose upon the Australian population, and, indeed, the world,
experimental medical therapies presented as being novel vaccines. The motives for doing this and
the parties involved are multi-various. Some were motivated by profit and others by ideology and
political advantage whilst others were driven by global strategic considerations. These parties are
both national and international.
7. With respect to Australia, I suspect that the foremost perpetrators/instigators of this criminal

activity have been:

a. members of the National Covid19 Clinical Evidence Task Force (NC19CT),

b. the Ministers for Health and Chief Medical Officers of the Federal, State and Territory
Departments of Health,

c. the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, and

d. members of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.

8. Complicit in this have been:
a. the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Premiers and Chief Ministers of
each State and Territory, and

b. various politicians of opposition parties who have demonised early treatment for
political advantage or ideology.

9. In some instances, the denial of early treatment and related information was deliberate and

with the full knowledge of its consequences. In others, it was due to profound incompetence, sloth,
politics and ignorance. That is the discriminator between murder, manslaughter and official
malfeasance whilst the forced imposition of dangerous injections upon the Australian Public on the
pretext of a contrived health emergency constitutes reckless endangerment.
10. It is up to your expert police investigatory team to decide which offence belongs to the above

listed persons as well as any others identified during the course of this investigation.

1 The World Council for Health represents over 100 reputable medical and scientific organisations. It lists a wide
range of alternative treatments. See: https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org

Page No 2 of 4 Last revised Loughrey 6 Jan 2022

**RECOMMENDATION**
11. I recommend that a Specialist Police Task Force be constituted at both the Federal and State
level to thoroughly investigate this matter, with the Federal Task Force playing a coordinating but
not a controlling role.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT/ADVICE ON INTENDED ACTION**
12. Your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter and your advice as to what action you intend to
take to address my concerns would be appreciated within the next 14 days.
