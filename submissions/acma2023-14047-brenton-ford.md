While it is important for governments to address the issue of misinforma4on and
disinforma4on, gran4ng government bureaucrats the power to be the arbiters of
informa4on can have significant consequences. Here are some poten4al concerns that arise
from such a scenario:

**1. Freedom of Speech: Entrus4ng government bureaucrats with determining what is**
considered misinforma4on or disinforma4on raises concerns about freedom of speech.
There is a risk that these powers could be misused or abused to s4fle dissen4ng voices,
poli4cal opposi4on, or alterna4ve viewpoints. It is essen4al to strike a balance between
comba4ng harmful misinforma4on and protec4ng individuals' right to express their
opinions.

**2. Lack of Transparency and Accountability: When government en44es become the**
gatekeepers of informa4on, there is a poten4al lack of transparency and accountability.
Decisions regarding what is deemed misinforma4on or disinforma4on may be subjec4ve and
biased, and the process of enforcement may lack transparency or oversight. This can erode
public trust and raise concerns about poten4al censorship.

**3. Poten@al for Poli@cal Manipula@on: Government bureaucrats wielding significant power**
over informa4on can lead to the poten4al for poli4cal manipula4on. Governments may
exploit these powers to shape public opinion, suppress dissent, or advance their own
poli4cal agendas. This undermines the democra4c principles of an informed ci4zenry and
impar4al informa4on dissemina4on.

**4. S@fling Innova@on and Free Exchange of Ideas: Imposing extensive regulatory burdens on**
digital plaJorms and requiring them to combat misinforma4on and disinforma4on can have
unintended consequences. It may discourage innova4on, burden smaller plaJorms, and
restrict the free exchange of ideas. Excessive regula4on can hinder the ability of individuals
to access diverse sources of informa4on and engage in open dialogue.

**5. Risk of Overreach and Mission Creep: Gran4ng government en44es broad powers to**
combat misinforma4on and disinforma4on opens the door to poten4al overreach and
mission creep. These powers could expand beyond their intended scope, encroaching on
privacy rights, undermining journalis4c independence, or s4fling legi4mate forms of
expression.

To effec4vely combat misinforma4on and disinforma4on, it is crucial to adopt measures that
preserve freedom of speech, encourage media literacy, promote transparency and
accountability, and involve mul4ple stakeholders, including independent fact-checkers, civil
society organisa4ons, and academia.
