The Committee
ACMA
Australian Government

Dear Committee Members

**Proposed Communications Legislation Bill**

As an adult, I have tried to understand how Adolf Hitler was able to manipulate the German
population in the first half of the Twentieth Century. Why did good people blindly follow him
and fall into line? Fast forward ninety years and the answer becomes clearer by the day. As the
very apt saying goes, all that we need for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing.

With all due respect, who are you to discern what is the truth and what is a lie on social media?
What are your qualifications to judge other people? As humans we are all fallible and we all
make mistakes.

It is interesting that the Government will be exempt from this proposed Communications
Legislation Bill. Does this exemption infer that only the Government tells the truth? Mr
Albanese and his colleagues must be very scared of the rise of independent media sources.
Legislating to silence the voices of those who oppose you shows an incredible sign of weakness
in our elected government.

From where I am standing this bill is all about propaganda and the silencing all discerning
voices that dare to have an opinion that differs from that of the government. The powers that
be are doing their very best to extinguish the voice of God and the voice of conservative reason
in our country.

We live in Australia â€“ a free and supposedly democratic country. People are sick of government
over-reach in their lives, and they will not be silenced. No-one should ever be silenced for their
beliefs and opinions and every person deserves the right to be heard.

May God bless the Great South Land of the Holy Spirit and may he change your hearts.

Yours sincerely

Mrs Deidre McKinnon
