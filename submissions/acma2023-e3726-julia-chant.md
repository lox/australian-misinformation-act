 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I object to the proposed legislation in the strongest terms based on the following:

The proposal will place limitations on freedom of speech and expression of ideas in the digital public space, which
constitutes an attack on the freedom of individuals and groups to engage in meaningful public debate.

The terms and definitions of what constitutes ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’ and ‘harm’ in the legislation
are extremely broad and open to a wide range of interpretations.

Nowhere in the legislation does it set out what viewpoints are acceptable and what would be regarded as
‘misinformation’ regarding any of the nominated ‘harm’ areas.

This legislation divides the community into two groups i.e. those who are bound by the ‘misinformation’ rules and
those who are exempt.

The legislations definition of ‘harm’ extends well beyond the community’s view of taboo subjects. For example, in the
legislation ‘harm’ is considered to include matters relating to health, the environment, economic and financial
matters, the Australian democratic process etc.

It will be incumbent on the digital platform to make the decisions on which comments, viewpoints and opinions
constitute ‘misinformation’. These digital platforms are almost all private, unelected organisations, who will be making
_very important decisions that go to the heart of freedom of speech in our country._

This legislation must not proceed and I urge you to preserve all aspects of freedom of speech that we the people of Australia
enjoy today.

Regards

Julia Chant
