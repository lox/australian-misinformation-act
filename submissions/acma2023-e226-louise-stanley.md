I wish to make a submission against this proposed legislation.

Who is to determine truth? My truth might be different to yours. And blocking peoples freedom of
speech is a totalitarian communist regime choice and shows not only a weakness of government but
shows that itâ€™s not there making the best choices for ALL Australians but appears to be making these
rules for their corporate masters. This is a treasonous act against the men and women of Australia. All
who vote in favour of this will be brought to justice for their actions.
