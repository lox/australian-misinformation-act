**Submission Concerning the Proposed Misinformation and Disinformation Bill**


Benjamin Franklin once said that: “Without freedom of thought, there can be no such thing as
wisdom – and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech.”. Hannah Arendt
thought that the ability of people “to hold different opinions and be aware that other people think
differently on the same issue (that) shields us from that god-like certainty which stops all
discussion and reduces social relationships to those of an ant heap”. She had seen what
happened when a totalitarian government controlled the press, and realised that it was better to
let disagreements see the light of day. Otherwise, the risk of conspiracy theories going
underground rises, and society can even see an increase in people being attracted to extremism,
and terrorism.

There are several arguments against the proposed Bill. These include the suggested powers of
the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the definitions in the Bill and the fines for
spreading disinformation and misinformation. If this Bill is enacted, it is likely to have “a chilling
effect on free speech,” as the Victorian Bar Association has stated.


**The Suggested Powers of the ACMA**


The ACMA would have sweeping powers under this legislation. As the government can appoint
the ACMA, direct its actions and even get rid of it, this is arguably not an independent
organisation! Under the proposed new legislation, the ACMA would have the power to take down
tweets or posts which it considers could cause serious harm, as well as charge enormous fines
to online companies which breach the legislation. The Bill unfortunately gives the unelected
bureaucrats of the ACMA too much power to silence speech in the public square without
transparency or accountability.

It also would be given powers that could be used against individuals who may have information
or documents which are relevant to misinformation or disinformation on a digital platform service.
The suspected authors or disseminators would be likely to be affected here. There is also no
protection from civil penalties, which is extremely unusual. This is also a worrying breach of
privacy.


**Vague Definitions**


The definitions in the Bill are extremely vague. The Bill is intended to combat “misinformation’
and ‘disinformation’ which allegedly ‘pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australiians, as
well as our democracy, society and economy”. The ACMA will be able to compel online service
providers to censor online speech that it considers ‘harmful’.

‘Misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ is vaguely defined as anything that ACMA determines is false,
misleading or deceptive’. This is incredibly vague. Would arguments against climate change be
restricted because they are unscientific? What about vaccines? If someone has an opinion about
the risk of injuries from vaccines being enough to deter them from receiving the Covid vaccine, is
that ‘disinformation’? Would this kind of post be removed, because it deters others from getting
the vaccine?

Incredibly, ‘harm’ is not defined, but ‘serious harm’ is. The definition is extremely subjective,
however. The ACMA would be given enormous powers to decide whether posts, tweets and
articles online could cause serious harm.


**Enormous Fines**


If companies don’t take down ‘false’ information, they could be forced to pay billions of dollars in
fines. The fines can be up to 5 per cent of a company’s global turnover. This could mean a fine of
over $8bn for Meta, because it’s global turnover is around $170bn.

These enormous fines don’t apply to any other breaches of any other legislation in existence,
and are unknown. Why are they so high? Is there such a huge risk of spreading ‘misinformation’
or ‘disinformation”?
