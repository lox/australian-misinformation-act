Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I first came to Australia as an international student over thirty years ago. One of the things that impressed me is the
freedom of speech in Australia compared to Asian countries. However, in the last few years in particular, more and
more of our freedoms are taken away.

Hence, I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

The big question is how we can determine what counts as “misinformation”. What is information to one person may be
“misinformation” to another. No one has a monopoly on truth. It is impossible for a government body to be responsible
for making these decisions.

There are so many examples where a previously-accepted idea was found to be untrue, but only after much
investigation and debate. Free speech is needed for us to arrive at the truth.

The idea that people sitting in an office somewhere in Canberra hold all the wisdom on what’s true and what is
“misinformation” is absurd     - and deeply dangerous. It’s the kind of move expected by a totalitarian government. We
are supposed to be a free nation.

Reject this authoritarianism.
