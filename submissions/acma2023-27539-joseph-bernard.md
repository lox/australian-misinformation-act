This attempt to censor free speech, to prevent people from sharing their own wisdom is putting our
whole society at risk of stepping back into a time of the Inquisition. A time, when it had everything
to do with control and nothing to do with truth. It was not people's feelings that were hurt, it was
their whole lives that were brutalized. It is not feeling that are at stake here, it is the future and
strength of our society that is at risk.

What would have happened if Galileo was shut down? You know, like claiming it was fake science,
and the “Fact” checking of the time insisting that this is not true and not according to my science!
would the earth still be flat?

Ironically, if the earth was flat then maybe Christopher Columbus would not have made his famous
expedition and I would guess that the American Indians would have been much happier and the
concept of free speech would not exist. Save us all a lot of time!

So, what would have happened if Einstein’s Special laws of relativity had been deemed to be
impossible? All heresy and “evil”! And what would become of Schrodinger’s box, what a
catastrophe. Damn. Locked in a minister’s box of miss information? The Cat would never have made
it past Cat in a Hat and there would have been NO modern electronics, computing, quantum
computing or even TV.

And “now”, a quantum leap later, here we are heading toward our future at an ever-faster pace than
at any other time in the history of mankind. But, how long before we crash? If we cannot clearly see
the road before us because we are blindfolded and gagged! Cannot see the road or even speak out
calling out the pitfalls before us!

Crash, look at us now! Weekend Australian has called out Tony Fauci and the false science. Hurray,
but that does not comfort the millions of people around the planet who have been injured or
“suddenly Died”? Is it? Look at the excess mortality rate and ask the families who have lost loved
ones, whose lives have been cut short! The fallout from the side effects of this untested MiRNA Jab
will continue for years to come!

But what would any of these lives matter at all if we are forced to live a lie? Forced to pretend that
WMDs really existed and the lives that were wasted just did not matter anyway!

I ask that you look at the freedom of expression as a strength, that offers far more than the few
headaches it sometimes causes. We are now able to the world is flat, but that does not change
reality. Look at the excess mortality rates, thousands of additional people are dying at the moment!
But, what if we were allowed to question the masks, question the jab, be allowed to discuss the
early treatment and/or be able to honestly discuss with our GP! Would we as a country be billions of
dollars better off, with a much healthier population?

I ask you to consider that freedom of speech is needed for freedom itself to exist! Freedom of
speech may hurt feelings but in the case of covid, freedom to challenge TGA has saved many lives!
There are no guarantees in life, but making us all stick our collective heads in a bucket of “accepted”
truths protects nobody. We are heading back to blasphemy laws and the dark ages.

Please vote for freedom! Say no to censorship and protect the truth.
