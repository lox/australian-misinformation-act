Proposed ‘Misinformation /Disinformation’ Law

This law will be the effective end of a free and democratic society if implemented.

The idea that the government is able, at all times now and in the future, to know what is truth or
falsehood, is itself a colossal piece of misinformation/disinformation. Convict yourselves.

What ignorance or arrogance to think you are the arbiters of the ‘rightness’ of the speech of all the
common populace.

Quite clearly, this law is designed to target the common person with the least resources to defend
themselves. Government, academia and corporate media will be exempt. These three groups are
free to propagate any false and self-serving narratives that they collectively or separately wish to. No
voice for the common person wishing to contradict.

What are you? You are certainly no democrats.
