**Exposure dra1 of the Communica8ons Legisla8on Amendment (Comba>ng Misinforma8on and**
**Disinforma8on) Bill 2023**

_Note: the following discussion relates only to informa6on that is currently legal to access and view in_
_Australia. Illegal informa6on is outside of the scope of this feedback._

The Bill seeks to make law to further abridge the right to freedom of opinion and expression
(including the right to access to informa;on) of people in Australia. It seeks to increase Government
censorship powers through requiring Digital PlaEorm Service Providers (Service Providers) to control
and censor informa;on on their plaEorms at the whim of the Government. The ‘requirement’ for the
Service Provider to implement this control and censorship func;on is likely intended to create the
appearance that Government is somewhat ‘removed’ from the decision-making role and is not the
party taking the restric;ve ac;ons. This is obviously not the case as the proposed Bill assigns
Government the role of ensuring the Service Providers carry out this censorship func;on, and if this
is not done to the Government’s sa;sfac;on, op;ons are available for the Government to force
Service Providers to comply. The ‘strongest’ op;on to force compliance being the development and
implementa;on of a mandatory Standard which the Service Providers must meet.

Service Providers already provide a high level of censorship to support their own, and likely
Government’s, agendas. Their use of automated ‘bots’ and so called ‘fact checkers’ to do this is quite
intense in some circumstances—the passing of the proposed Bill will merely provide a legal basis for
the Government to con;nue, and expand, this suppression of freedom of opinion and expression in
Australia.

The proposed Bill will transform Government (both itself and through Service Providers) into a
func;onal boMleneck through which all informa;on passing the Digital Services PlaEorms must pass.
It recognises the Government as being the only party capable of objec;vely discerning between
perceived ‘good’ and ‘bad’ informa;on, and gives Government a mandate to decide what
informa;on is allowed to pass through to the people. Any informa;on provider the Government
views unfavourably will easily be stopped from providing informa;on for the people, whether the
people seek this informa;on or not. While superficially it appears to consider Australian people as
not being capable of assessing informa;on, and therefore needing Government’s protec;on, at a
deeper level it is simply an easy means by which the Government can censor people’s ability to
access informa;on the Government does not like.

The premise that Government must intervene in people’s access to informa;on in order to protect
them from ‘misinforma;on’ and ‘disinforma;on’ has dis;nct authoritarian overtones, whether this is
inten;onal or uninten;onal. The defini;ons/meaning of these terms, and their applicability to any
given circumstances, is purely subjec;ve. This would enable government to easily filter and censor
informa;on that does not meet its agenda, even though the informa;on may be desired by the
target audience. How easy would it be for government to subjec;vely classify informa;on as ‘false,
misleading or decep;ve’? Par;cularly when there are no clear mechanisms available for the public to
closely monitor and take ac;ons on Government misuse of these powers. Addi;onally, are there
even such things as misinforma;on and disinforma;on? Or is there merely wrong informa;on that
can be resolved through the provision of beMer informa;on? Is it even Government’s role to fight
against misinforma;on and disinforma;on, or should their efforts be more concerned with providing
beMer informa;on?

Government’s aspira;on to appoint itself to the role of ‘keeper’ of informa;on transmiMed through
Digital PlaEorms, where it is empowered to iden;fy and remove from public access what it iden;fies
to be misinforma;on and disinforma;on, is very dangerous. One needs only consider the
misinforma;on, disinforma;on, coercion and decep;on used by Governments in Australia in the
past. A major recent example being government’s ‘management’ of the alleged Covid-19 pandemic
during the past 3.5 years. Government has con;nued to provide assurances to the public that the
alleged causal agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus (along with its supposed variants), has been isolated and
demonstrated to exist, with relevant studies being used to inform government decision-making. It
has con;nued to assert that these studies are available in the public domain but has so far been
unable to provide details of any such studies that demonstrate the existence of SARS-Cov-2.

Basically, in order to begin to prove there is indeed a virus that is causing a disease, it would be
necessary to: isolate the said virus par;cles from many hosts exhibi;ng the disease; characterise the
par;cles; show that the par;cles are replica;on competent; and demonstrate that the par;cles
cause the disease when introduced into a host organism via a ‘normal’ transmission route. This has
not been done, and accordingly, the Government s;ll has no evidence to even begin to demonstrate
the existence of the virus.

It is unfortunate that ‘virology’ does not u;lise the ‘scien;fic method’ when conduc;ng scien;fic
studies, as do studies in all other scien;fic areas. It is also very unfortunate that Governments in
Australia knowingly accept this use of ‘pseudoscience’ as proof of the existence of viruses, preferring
to rely on a faith-based approach rather than on systema;c studies to guide their policy/decision
making. While these problems have been repeatedly drawn to its aMen;on, Government has
doubled-down on this poten;al fraud in order to con;nue with their agenda rather than publicly
acknowledge the problems and look toward iden;fying solu;ons.

As further evidence that Government is in no way capable, or trustworthy, to be the deciders of what
informa;on is made available to the public one need only look at current Government censorship of
informa;on, as recently highlighted by ‘The Australian’ newspaper. It was revealed that the
Australian Government, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, had secretly censored at least
4000 social media posts. Many of the posts contained factual informa;on and reasonable arguments,
and it is fairly obvious that they must have contained contextual informa;on that the Government
feared would expose, or further highlight, deficiencies in its agenda.

In summary, it is clear that the government has decided the public has no right to freely assess
informa;on and make their own decision on the value of this informa;on. Rather, it has decided that
the public can only access informa;on ‘approved’ by the government (through the Service Providers
under their control). There is an overall assump;on that individual users are not capable of assessing
informa;on in their decision-making process, and it is up to Government to decide who can provide
informa;on to the people. Government has substan;ally demonstrated in recent ;mes their total
inability to judge and provide the public with factual informa;on. Government must not be allowed
to increase their ability to restrict people’s right to freedom of opinion and expression.
