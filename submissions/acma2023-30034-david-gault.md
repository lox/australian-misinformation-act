With regards to the proposed bill empowering the ACMA to monitor Misinformation and
disinformation.

I reject this bill as it is the basis of supressing free speech and moreover alternative views.
We can not respect the values and privileges of living in a democracy when our elected
Government has the power to silence and control our opinions. These opinions often come
from well informed ultimate media and often raise an alternate point of view that may not be
in the best interest of Government but in the best interest of the constituent. There are a
myriad of references hear where the bias of government desiring the benefits of their agenda
have turned out to be damaging and suppressive to public interest on a whole.

Covid-19 is a prime example of authoritarianism going to far and through the covid pandemic
spawned the structure of Misinformation and disinformation were as unless the information
came from the medical advice it was dismissed as unqualified and unreputable despite the
undeniable facts presented by so called conspirators. In the end there was and is no Covid
pandemic that wiped out any mass population anywhere vaccinated or not. Fewer people
died through the 3-year pandemic than the 3 years prior to the pandemic and what we see
now is no physical fact to the claim that this is a deadly virus worthy of shutting down the
economy and destroying peoples lives by shattering their mission and derailing their
momentum. What we do know is the medical industry and big pharma have made a fortune
out of this hypothetical Covid-19 pandemic which was based on inaccurate PCR testing and
complete ignorance to alternative analysis. To cap this so called need to control
Misinformation and disinformation clause we should note the disgusting division that was
formed between vaccinated and unvaccinated that created the division and discrimination of
those that believed the vaccine was not worth the risk. The control of free speech in the
pandemic years gave rise to some of the most appalling media influences I have ever
witnessed and one such example can be seen here with Mel & Kochie on channel 7, here’s
the link (1) How to deal with unvaccinated family members this Christmas | 7NEWS - YouTube
stating “what to do with unvaccinated family members at Christmas”, so enraged was the
public about Kochie’s statement that the user comments had to be turned off.

The role of Government is to assist not to dominate and control. It is the responsibility of the
individual to evaluate information and determine what is legit and what is propaganda.

I like to derive an opinion by collating as much information as possible and when I am
satisfied that all things have been considered then I’m comfortable with concluding that
decision. The Government doesn’t always get it right and again so many examples like Robo
Debt and so on and you’re asking us to lay our believes on what you approve and
disapprove. Certainly, doesn’t seem like a democratic prosses to me, so I will unequitable so
NO to the proposed bill to regulate social media platforms and public discussions.

Regards

Dave Gault.
