# Why the New ACMA powers draft law to combat misinformation and disinformation should be struck down.

**The Internet and freedom of speech**

The evolution of the internet has provided unprecedented freedom of information sharing and
social interaction. It is an advance for the good of the majority even if information can be
confusing to a minority. The majority of people in the western democratic nations treasure such
freedom.

Social network sites should be likened to the town's public square, people should be free to
express themselves as long as they don't insult or bully other individuals. In fact today's social
media platforms should be imagined as a service provider on top of the service provider that is
the foundational internet backbone. Think of it as an information channeling system built on the
existing public utility infrastructure such as a courier freight rail network on top of the rail system.
A courier does not police the majority of what people send to each other or companies selling to
its customers!)

The shining hallmark of modern western democratic civilisation, that is freedom of speech and
freedom of information. Any citizen of such a nation should be allowed to voice the information
plus opinion they gather and pass on to those they wish to or deem necessary to receive.
Governments and related entities should not hinder the rights of its citizens to do such a thing.
They do not have the right to do so.

National security can not be and should not be an excuse in preventing freedom of information
to pass around between citizens. Citizens of a democracy have the right to learn evidence of
various proven war crimes committed by government related entities, hence making judgment in
democratic political processes whether to support such unethical, lack of moral high ground
actions, especially a war. After all, it has been the principle of democracy that sets democratic
nations apart from totalitarian ones.

**Independence and authoritative qualification of the ACMA**

What and who ensures that ACMA is really independent? What and who makes sure that
ACMA does not side with government propaganda or misinformation by government connected
commercial entities? The draft law appears to indicate that the various levels of the government
clearly have exemptions on what they put out. Hence just this clause alone shows that ACMA
can't be independent if they don't have power to criticize the government itself!

Then the laws ’clauses seem to favor the so called ‘professional news content ’which is from the
so called mainstream commercial media and press! However, the definition and quality of
‘professional news ’really comes into question given today's technology allows everyone with a


-----

camera or smartphone to be a journalist (given journalism means the action to record and report
an event that took place.). Mainstream commercial media doesn't mean they are professional,
or correct and truthful by default.

Given the so-called professional news media is to be exempted or given free passes, little
wonder why in the recent the voice referendum debate, tons of clearly misinformation and
disinformation got passed along those media. A clear example that ACMA needs to hold them
accountable as they should be held to a way higher standard.

Then take for example the event of a fire ravaging a building in the city recently, hundreds of
people witnessed that and used phones and various camera devices to take pictures and video.
What makes the so-called professional news footage superior to the many footage taken by
citizens witnessing the event? In fact news of the fire came first and came faster than the socalled ‘professional news ’via the social media platforms. Footage from citizen journalists was
first and can be superior to the professional news casting footage as there are many more of
them and from various perspectives. Hence having forced the public to rely on so-called
_‘professional news ’seems like a limited preselected confinement, deliberately disregarding the_
various quality and fact verifiable sources that are factual and truthfully reflects what has
happened, which is also news and not disinformation and misinformation!

Then what criteria and scientific authority for ACMA to rely upon to be able to give balanced and
independent advice to confirm what news is fact or fiction when it comes to highly technical and
scientific information such as medical information and other topics of science?

Here is one hypothetical scenario:

let's say the time is 16XX, the church and the government believe the sun rotates around the
earth and earth is the centre of the universe. The likes of Galileo Galilei post information from
their research claiming the earth goes around the sun and earth is not the centre of the
universe. The church and government bodies call Galileo's lot of astronomers spreading
misinformation and disinformation. If ACMA existed at the time, what gives ACMA the scientific
backing to judge if Galileo-like astronomers are spreading misinformation or how ACMA can
decide if the church (and the government) is preaching the absolute truth? If ACMA sides with
the church and government, then ACMA will be completely factually wrong.

Let’s consider another scenario:

This time in the future, a couple of amateur astronomers around the world capture crystal clear
quality photos of an alien starship passing by earth lid up by the sun. The government and
mainstream astronomers claim these are misinformation and disinformation. What makes
ACMA capable of judging if the photos from more than one sources are disinformation and
misinformation when other third party photo experts plus astronomers claim otherwise?


-----

I can come up with many more scenarios that show the complexity and impossibility for one
authority, let alone a minister, to decide on what is fact and what is misinformation when it
comes to complex scientific and medical matters!

The fact is, it takes long term research and collective hard work and debate to decide on
complex scientific and medical issues, no one authority can quickly dismiss or champion one
side of any scientific arguments and observations. Therefore bodies such ACMA or any
government ministers do not fit to judge what is misinformation or fact in matters of such
complexity. No self respecting true scientist will proclaim he or herself as ‘I am Science!’.

True scientists and those who have trained on scientific methods and logic agree that debate is
the norm and encouraged in the science community, in fact one can argue debate and
challenge from peers is what makes science progress with advance and keep being proven
right!

True independent body should not have an exemption in criticising the government. Court of law
sees government agencies at various levels equal and can be taken to court, therefore a true
fair independent body will be given power to fairly judge the information, from various levels of
government, criticise and punish these government bodies for spreading proven false and
misleading information! There should be no hypocritical nonsense of one rule for the people,
another for the government!

Yet in this draft law, it is clear that different levels of governments get an exemption, therefore
one can conclude the ACMA is hardly fair nor independent with these powers!

**Ministry of truth**

George Orwell's timeless forewarning classics 1984 was required reading of the KGB in USSR
and it has been on the Australian high school English class reading list for decades. In 1984’s
plot, the ministry of truth is a government agency that decides what is fact and what is the
correct history. Therefore to anyone who read and understood the story and its warnings, one
can't help but compare to ACMAs power to that of the ministry of truth in the novel.

Where is the clear cut well defined wording / clause in pain english in the draft law that would
clearly define these ACMA powers, ensuring it won't evolve the ACMA into the real ministry of
_truth? In fact one can argue the various vague terms that open to political interpretation plus_
lacking in power to hold government bodies accountable for their misinformation is already one
foot into the ministry of truth.

**Measure of adulthood and daddy government**

The measure of an adult is his or her ability to distinguish between truth and propaganda, able
to make out facts from lies. It is up to the adult person and his or her experience to believe and
choose what to believe or trust. It is not the government’s job to parent grown adults. The best


-----

the government can provide is advice and counter information to expose these lies and
propaganda with proven facts and detailed research that is balanced and independent of
political influences.

With the government's financial power, they would certainly create a support information portal
with facts and truthful information that can withstand criticism. The people will decide if to trust
the government body’s information or information from other parties. One good example for
such an information provider was ABC TV’s TV show ‘The Checkout’. It was rather successful in
spreading correct information regarding the government’s consumer protection law to the public,
allowing the public to learn their rights as consumers and see through some of the corporation's
deceptive misinformation conduct, sadly the program was axed.

Government should not set up a body to be a judge and able to act as some sort of punisher to
utility platforms for what is factual and truthful information or not. Misinformation and
disinformation is not bullying or personal attack and defamation, the government does not need
to set-up a protection system to protect individuals.

**social media platform are utilities not content creators**

ACMA’s original purpose is to police commercial bodies which put out false advertising and
untruthful information on their products and services, this works for news companies whose
primary function is to create curated information as a publisher of content they help make or
select to broadcast. But social media platform entities are not publishers, where its service is to
act as conveying bodies of information by its millions of users, they are closer to telephone
companies and internet service providers. Governments have no rights to police one individual
telling another individual or various individuals what they know and learn. Given such info
passing can be legally done in a two person whisper conversation, a speech at a party or
meeting or simply by speaking in a town square to a gathering.

Like a water utility supply company, platform providers can't be held responsible if a user
passes proven misinformation to another. A company like that can try their best to make and
label such proven false information if found but it is not possible to stop nor should the company
be punished. Blaming social media platforms for lies on them is like asking the phone company
to be responsible for an individual's lie to other individuals via the telephone, instead of
exposing and letting the people punish the lying individual.

Any one with experience with the email systems of the world know it is full of scam and spam
emails, the majority can be proven as misinformation to some degree. But for decades, it is
proven spam and scam mail can't be stopped, despite all the spam filters, it is up to the
individual to take measures against them in the end. Was it because the ACMA cannot find
email carriers like Google and Microsoft responsible for those misinformation of scam and spam
emails numbering billions a day, therefore the email service was exempted in the draft law?

**The downfall of so-called professional news aka mainstream media as informer of**


-----

**misinformation and facts**

The press or so-called ‘professional news ’was supposed to be the watchdog for fake news and
information and held governments accountable. In the past, investigative reporters would dig
into various pieces of events and uncover lies and deceit plus propaganda from companies or
from the government! Sadly the press seems to lose this ability in the last 10 or so years! If so
called mainstream professional news would continue to put out truthful factual information,
alternative information channels would not become popular as an alternative source of news
and information!

In fact, it was because the so-called professional news press or msm (main stream media)
became proven misinformation spreaders that lead to the rise of alternative independent media
on social platforms as channels to pass information.

It was because audiences of alternative media on social platforms find its news information to
be more truthful and factual than so-called professional news / mainstream press that contribute
to their success.

It would only make ACMAs with its new power to be a ministry of truth if it was found to label
what proven as truthful facts of news from social media platforms as misinformation.

One prime example in the recent 2020 U.S. Election cycle is the infamous hunter Biden laptop
saga, where the independent alternative media claim the laptop’s information was factual and
real evidence of wrongdoing. But mainstream press / professional news media claim it was
misinformation by the ‘all mighty ’Russians back in 2020.

Yet in 2023, various U.S. Government agencies themselves prove undeniably the laptop and
info contained inside are factual truth. The US professional mainstream press admit it is fact and
real now ^1. Hunter Biden even got charged for it, hence what was once labelled misinformation
from independent media sources becomes proven factual truth. What was Russia's
misinformation ‘fact ’championed by the so-called professional media press becomes proven
misinformation. In this scenario, if ACMA sided with the U.S. Government agencies and US
_professional news media label the laptop saga as misinformation in 2020, ACMA will evidently_
lose all credibility as with authority today.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the government should not provide such power to an authority to judge what is
fact or misinformation, especially with political agenda in play. Only autocratic, authoritarian
governments seek to do that. There are countless examples in history for such an act.

Adult citizens do not need the government to be their parents, to hand-held them on defining
what's truth, what's lie. All governments can do is provide accessible counter to lies info for
citizens. Whether the citizens choose to use such information or service is up to the citizens


-----

freedom.

Even If such a judgment body must exist in a democracy, then for it to be truly independent it
must have power to accuse and call out the government itself much like the civil and criminal
law system.

Establishing ACMA to be a judge and able to fine information conveying utility platforms is like
starting a ministry of truth. It is not a positive step in a true democracy known to champion
personal liberty, freedom of speech and press as well as freedom of individual expression.

ACMA should reject such power which infringes on the freedom of speech, the shining beacon
of western democracy.

True Democratic governments by the people and for the people will not let such registration
be tabled, let alone pass this law in parliaments. Because doing so only proves the
misinformation by a minority: Western governments are now controlled by a ‘deep state entity ’
_pushing for taking away rights such as freedom of speech and changing these governments into_
_autocratic governments._

Hence true representatives of various electoral districts within Australia who are truly for the
people should vote no to this draft law, and there should be no amendments in passing such
law in any form, it should be struck down for true democracy! Elected representatives need to
do that to prove the conspiracies wrong!
