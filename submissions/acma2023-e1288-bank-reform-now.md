re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

**TRIGGER WARNING - This document contains ideas and commentary that some**
**people will find offensive. It is quite possible that some readers will experience**
**their feelings being hurt. The truth often hurts.**

We feel that more likely, most people will be open to discussing ideas and historical
references they currently don't know much about as a means of improving their own
ideas and views regarding human rights, freedoms, responsibilities, and the
Realpolitik which is responsible for most of the hardship, fear and uncertainty gripping
most peoples of the world right now.

BRN thanks the government for this opportunity to contribute to the removal of the
offensive Bill which is the subject of this contribution to the debate. Any politician
supporting this legislation should be ashamed and embarrassed ..... and probably
should step down because they are most certainly not serving the interests of the
people or the nation. This Bill is the line which must not be crossed.

The underlying assumption in this Bill is that Big Brother knows best. Who is "Big
Brother?" George Orwell and most well educated people would say it is an
authoritarian government controlling & exploiting the people and resources of a nation
or region of the world. In reality it's a bit more complicated.

Authoritarian governments are actually tools of an elite ruling class which seeks to
control as much of the world as possible. That class does not care if a nation's
government is of the left or of the right. The key is that the government is far enough
over on one side or another to control a country's resources for the benefit of the
rulers. [Please review one such ruler and the policies required to rectify the damage
caused to millions of ―subjects‖ - The Last Emperor >>
https://www.bankreformnow.com.au/node/616 ]

Big Brother’s determination and propagation of the ―truth‖ requires several elements
be put in place. The Albanese government's legislation seeks to do just that.

1


-----

First, it aims to suppress citizens expressing their "unapproved", unfiltered,
"unacceptable" views, ideas, and beliefs on social media and various digital platforms.
Unapproved views are simply views that diverge from a Big Brother approved
narrative. This narrative is designed to manipulate the thoughts of citizens i.e. it is a
form of population control. In other words - the government is managing the livestock
on behalf of the rulers.

Second, it exempts politicians & all levels of government, schools, universities, and
mainstream media. Why would that be? Because these institutions are the key way
that governments spread approved narratives. In other words - they are the outlet for
ruler-friendly and ruler-endorsed propaganda. [Please review Operation Mockingbird https://allthatsinteresting.com/operation-mockingbird - for more information].

### This Legislation is Anti-human and Anti-Life

The rulers take advantage of
many people’s desire to have
a nice world; a world free of
offence; a world where
everyone is happy and nice to
each other; a world where
everyone agrees on the
―important‖ things; a world
with no hatred and no
tribalism. In a word ….Utopia.

The Utopians – now known as
Globalists – want to create
such a world but not to
improve the lives of the many.
No …. their Utopia aims to
solidify and further lock in their
power and wealth at the
expense of the rest of the
world. The sort of world they
want sees people left with just
enough to avoid rioting and
elite lynching. People must be
moulded by perpetual
narrative attack and fear to
accept their place and not
think for themselves or
question the rulers.

One problem with this is that
people have feelings.

Feelings are not up for debate
or manipulation. They just are.
End of story.

-----

What does this mean? A few examples – some cultures or groups may feel sick at the
thought of female genital mutilation (FGM). They may protest, write articles or
campaign against the practice because they feel so strongly about it. The cultures or
groups that support FGM may feel hurt or ―harmed‖ (see _Excerpt 1 below) by these_
protests and attitudes. The government’s proposed legislation could be triggered to
suppress discussion due to a perceived ―hatred‖ between the opposing groups.

**__________________________________**

_Excerpt 1_

**__________________________________**

The feelings people have are based on the beliefs they hold. Beliefs are up for
discussion only if the person chooses to engage in analysis or debate about their
beliefs. People can have all sorts of strange or irrational beliefs often based on rubbish
they have been taught or exposed to. Some people believe that people with different
coloured skin are inferior. Only free and open rational discussion can change hearts
and minds …. not government decrees, mandates, or censorship.

Where there is a right to intervene is when a person’s feelings and beliefs lead to
actions which impact another’s rights and freedoms – [please see Appendix 1 for the
fundamental elements – this presentation is concerned with element 4 – Freedom of
Thought, Belief and Speech but the others are equally important and when threatened
by government overreach will trigger protests which authoritarian rulers will seek to
suppress with legislation very much like the Bill under discussion here].

Let me be clear … a delinquent texting rubbish on Twitter is far less dangerous than a
government making mistakes and basing policies on those mistakes or worse
spreading propaganda to achieve a political goal using deception and malfeasance.

Just imagine – a government goes down a policy track based on flawed information
and beliefs and their actions cause real harm, mayhem and chaos along with feelings
of despair & hopelessness for millions of people … AND – to top it off - the people are
suppressed in their ability to protest and seek a remedy!

Recently in Australia the Royal

Commission into Robodebt revealed that
the program ―..was a crude and cruel
mechanism, neither fair nor legal …. It was
a costly failure of public administration, in
both human and economic terms.‖ It
illustrated ―a myriad of ways that things
can go wrong through venality,

incompetence and cowardice." A federal
court judge had previously ruled that
Robodebt was a "massive failure in public
administration." The saga proves very well
that governments can get important issues
dead wrong. The proposed Misinformation
Bill will make it harder to expose such
crimes and hold politicians and public
servants accountable – particularly since
the Bill excludes them (see Excerpt 2 below).

By the way – the Robodebt scandal could very well be the ―canary in the coalmine‖
regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence to maximise efficiencies in business and
government. Aiming for maximum efficiency and productivity does not always work in
favour of the people living and working in such a high pressure environment. We
explored this when looking at how stupid the concept of GDP is – for more information
see the BRN Well Being Index >> http://www.bankreformnow.com.au/node/346

_Excerpt 2_

-----

When the empire used ―weapons of mass destruction‖ as the excuse to invade Iraq
people protested and exposed the lies … eventually. If the Misinformation Bill is put in
place what happens the next time we are being manipulated into war? One person’s
misinformation is another person’s truth. Only open discussion – not censorship – will
show what is really going on (see Excerpt 3 below).

_Excerpt 3_

**__________________________________**

When people protest in Hong Kong or Iran they are labelled freedom fighters and
heroes by our political class and media.

What about the peaceful protests against government attacks on core human rights in
Canada and Melbourne which saw protesters pilloried by Justin Trudeau and Daniel
Andrews? They were labelled as terrorists, shot at, subject to bank freezes and worse.

It’s all part of narrative control. The proposed legislation is a disaster for our country
and its people. Ignorance and stupidity are best dealt with by education.

Good quality honest education. For example, were school students taught that the
1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident was effectively a false flag operation which facilitated the

5


-----

legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces to South Vietnam and the
commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam?

What happens when governments put in place policy based on flawed science? The
classic example is Soviet era Lysenkoism. It’s a case study into the dangerous
consequence when politics and ideology intrude into science. Was this taught in
schools to Aussie students?

Trofim Lysenko's influence on science and agriculture was supported by Stalin so no
criticism was allowed. Scientists who opposed Lysenkoism were not just censored by
the government they often ―disappeared.‖ Thus the fatally flawed policies continued for
far longer than would have been possible had informed debate been allowed and
encouraged. This exacerbated a severe reduction in Soviet food production which led
to famine killing millions.

Manipulation of science for political purposes should be a crime against humanity. The
cost of these crimes can be trillions of dollars to nations on top of the unconscionable
destruction of livelihoods and lives.

The key point is that some topics are taboo - never to be discussed in public. There
are questions the rulers do not want asked let alone answered – see Appendix 4 for a
list we have previously presented for discussion. No politicians have helped get
answers to us. Noam Chomsky articulated the issue very well – ―The smart way to
keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable
opinion, but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more
critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking
going on, while all the time presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the
limits put on the range of the debate.‖

### A better way to deal with digital platforms & human rights

The number one thing to do after the proposed legislation is thrown into the dustbin of
history is to establish a Bill of Digital Rights.

Bearing in mind that American taxpayer money created the internet we would like to
see a Digital Bargain formed around what could now be considered an essential public
utility. Americans have generously allowed the world to share in its marvels. To use
the ―people’s internet,‖ platforms such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook must respect
the fundamental rights of the people. Perhaps they should pay rent too (much easier
to collect than taxes).

Regarding freedom of speech – a platform cannot eject or refuse access to any
person just because they disagree with someone’s political or social views. The
internet is a conduit of communication. ISPs and Social Media platforms are not
publishers of information and data. Think about phone lines. Would it be OK for a
telecommunications company to stop people communicating on their network just
because they didn’t agree with the communication or approve of the communicator?

There are many critical issues in this topic – including: Surveillance; Bio-metric Data;
Facial Recognition; Artificial Intelligence (including the use of ―deep fake‖ audio and

6


-----

video of individuals); Digital ID; Social Credit Score; App Attack (e.g. phone apps that
breach your fundamental rights to exploit you and your data); Government
transparency; Encryption; Net Neutrality; Data collection usage & storage; Privacy;
Digital Money; Democracy.

Remember - Just because it can be done doesn’t mean it should be done. All
technological marvels can be used as tools of exploitation and control.

The brilliant leaders and geeks at Facebook, Twitter and the rest should find it pretty
easy to banish malicious social media bots from their platforms. These are one of the
tools that are used by genuine threats to our country and privacy. For example they
are involved in: Artificially amplifying the popularity of a person or movement (often
used by politicians and their parties); Influencing elections; Manipulating financial
markets; Amplifying phishing attacks; Spreading spam; Shutting down free speech (for
example during the 2010-2012 Arab Spring movement, government agencies used
Twitter bots to overwhelm social media feeds. These bots were used to deliberately
push down the messages of protestors and activists).

The Albanese government has been under pressure to ―crack down‖ on
―misinformation & disinformation.‖ This is part of a global agenda. At present Australia
is in lockstep with other countries being pushed by various entities and organisations
such as the UN, World Economic Forum, World Health Organisation, and the
International Monetary Fund.

America, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and much of Europe are in the same position.

Why does much of the leadership of these countries work in a way that appears to
serve elite interests rather than the interests of their people and country?

There are several possible reasons:

1. Globalism may have become an ideological obsession
2. Many leaders have become wealthy. Quite a few have virtually no experience

working in sectors that create wealth and jobs.

3. There is no way that many of them could earn the sort of money they receive

from the taxpayers’ purse if they lost their position in politics. [Here, we are
ignoring the post-politics jobs that are part of their ―reward program‖].

4. The world is not as nice as the Utopians would like it to be. Many world leaders

are compromised in some way - and the most powerful government security
operations know everything. Edward Snowden exposed the truth about
programs such as ―Temora,‖ ―Karma Police,‖ ―Black Hole,‖ ―Five Eyes,‖ ―Prism‖
(which was fed mega-data from Facebook, Google, Apple and, Microsoft),
―XKeyscore,‖ ―Muscular,‖ ―Project 6,‖ ECHELON and ―Lustre.‖

5. Most of these countries have had their _“cabinets penetrated” >>_

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxJ1wPnkk4

Bank Reform Now would like to see Prime Minister Albanese stand up for Australia’s
sovereignty and set an example for the rest of the world by refusing to implement the
policies being pushed by various elite pressure groups. Australians can show what is
possible when key rights are genuinely respected.

7


-----

Some good signs would be the government:

a) Axing the proposed atrocious and dangerous ―Misinformation‖ Bill.
b) Stopping the push toward a Central Bank Digital Currency.
c) Stopping and reversing the closure of bricks & mortar banking services.
d) Stopping their very significant contribution to the cost of living crisis (particularly

the effect of government policies on the cost of mortgages and rents – see the
_Housing Affordability Crisis >> http://www.bankreformnow.com.au/node/348)._

e) Stopping all actions against

whistleblowers – Julian
Assange, Richard Boyle, and
David McBride. Make sure they
are safe in their Australian
homes, compensate them, and
celebrate them. They used their
freedom of speech to expose
government crimes and
malfeasance. This is what
freedom of speech is for.

Australians want politicians that are clearly working in their interests. For decades we
have seen the exact opposite.

It should not be bordering on impossible for most people to own a home of their own
and afford their family’s requirements. People want to work and get a fair go without
being fleeced to support a corrupt system. They want to own something and be happy.
And … they want to be free to protest and communicate about these sorts of issues
on the various internet platforms if and when necessary.

### Government does not always get it right. Science is never settled.

This is the harsh truth. The following historical quotes are just some examples. Also
see Appendix 2 for more examples where dangerous ideas and substances were able
to be profited from because their safety and effectiveness were not properly
questioned, investigated and debated. Appendix 3 contains several relevant quotes
from a few respected commentators regarding freedom of speech.

Tolerating the expression of ideas we don't like is not easy or natural. It often goes
against the grain and takes some willpower and effort. It is similar to the battle within
we face when supporting the right to life.

History well shows that the governments that have the power and inclination to censor
bad ideas or points of view will most certainly stifle good ideas that they don't like.

Similarly we spare the lives of the worst criminals because to give the power to kill to
governments, politicians and judges sees horrific mistakes and crimes that go against
our ideals of living in civilised freedom. Here we explain why - like freedom of
speech - the right to life is so critical >> https://www.bankreformnow.com.au/node/527/

You may recall - during the COVID disaster that many politicians and celebrities were
extremely cruel and rude to people who felt safer not injecting an unproven substance
into their bodies. Of course those celebrities made full use of their freedom of speech.
Arnold Schwarzenegger infamously and angrily told them –

## ―SCREW YOUR FREEDOM.‖

Well attacks on fundamental freedoms and rights will lead protestors to march in the
streets telling the rulers and their politicians –

## ―FUCK YOUR DICTATORSHIP!!‖

Thank you kindly for your interest and time on this important issue.

 What if the official ―narrative‖ is wrong?


**Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642) –**
sentenced to live the rest of his life
under house arrest by the Inquisition
(1633). His crime? Stating his view
and the evidence that the Earth
#### revolved around the sun. A heretical
view opposed by the Catholic
Church’s narrative of the time.

His offending Dialogue was banned;
and in an action not announced at
the trial, publication of any of his
works was forbidden. He was
censored for thought crimes and
publishing ―misinformation.‖

**Thalidomide is a drug that was**
widely used by pregnant women in
the late 1950s and early '60s to
relieve nausea and as a sedative.
It was later shown that women who
took the drug in early pregnancy
were at increased risk of having a
child with physical abnormalities.
The need for the testing and
approval of the toxins in certain
pharmaceutical drugs became
more important after the disaster.

In 2012 the German drug company

### APPENDIX 4

 A collection of taboo questions - Aussies really want to know:

1. What are we to you, the country, and the various powers that have great influence
on the world's nations and economies?

2. Are we registered assets?

3. Are we just considered units of economic activity?

4. Are we just vassals existing to generate consumption and production for the profit of
others?

5. Do we have any Common Law rights?

6. Is there any truth to the "conspiracy" that men and women exist - deceptively - in
two forms with significant legal ramifications? One is considered a corporate entity or
"person" - designated by a NAME IN CAPITALS and the other a flesh & blood living
being with Common Law rights. What is your understanding of this issue? If you don't
know please discuss with someone who does and get back to us.

7. Is it true that a private grouping of powerful and wealthy individuals and families
own more than 40% of the assets of the 40,000 companies making up the world's
capital markets?

8. Do the world's governments facilitate these wealthy groupings to hide and control
their assets via complex Trust and Company arrangements often involving various tax
havens?

9. Can you explain to us the history and purpose of the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS)?

10. Is it true that US Federal Reserve is in effect controlled by four large private
companies: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard and Fidelity? Who are the major
shareholders in these entities?

11. Do you believe the media is genuinely holding the government to account?

12. Many believe that the major news organisations are actually serving elite interests
... possibly through close co-operation with major US and British intelligence agencies.
This would mean that much of the "news" we are fed is actually propaganda. What do
you think?

20


-----

13. The law appears to be used as weapon against men and women rather than as a
shield to protect them from abuses of power? Do you think the legal system is
functioning in the men and women of Australia's interests?

14. During the recent a once in a hundred years crisis. People were facing
joblessness, bankruptcy, and eviction. The government appeared to be: shielding the
banks; increasing the country's debt to the international banking cartel; diverting
money in a reckless and unproductive manner. Why didn't the government utilise our
sovereign monetary system - as clearly spelled out in our Constitution - in the way our
forefathers had designed?

15. Don't you think it is a pity that our country does not have Sovereign Wealth fund?

16. Isn't it a shame that in the early 1970s the Liberal and Labor parties were happy to
sign up to the UN's Lima Agreement which assisted in the destruction of Australia's
capacity to continue manufacturing .... in Australia? A strong local manufacturing
capacity would have been very useful during the COVID crisis - don't you think?

17. Have you tried purchasing land and businesses in many of our trading partners'
countries? Perhaps if you discovered how difficult that is you would decide that maybe
our country's resources and assets are best held in Australian hands.

18. Please explain why the wealthiest and most powerful organisations such as
various religious operations and big businesses are exempt from taxation? This is
curious for several reasons particularly as many of these entities have for many
generations been guilty of all manner of criminal and predatory activities including but
not limited to child sex abuse, money laundering, and drug trafficking.

19. Is it true that the government
has passed legislation that will
allow the banks to take their
customers' deposits and
superannuation during a financial
crisis? During a crisis you should
be looking after the people's
interests. The banking system is
being used as a tool to control and
impoverish nations. Do not lock us
into such a system by banning
cash. Do not bail-out or bail-in this
crooked system. Reform it to work
for the country and people.
