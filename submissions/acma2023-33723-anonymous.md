**Subject: Submission - Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you as an Australian citizen regarding the draft bill titled the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I am
alarmed by this proposed bill, which in my view demonstrates a lack of respect for the
freedom of speech of Australian citizens.

One of my main concerns with this bill is the creation of two classes of citizens. The first class
consists of politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions who will possess
the power to spread information, whether true or false, online. The second class
encompasses regular citizensâ€”individuals who often possess extensive knowledge and
insights on various topics. It is evident that such differentiation could harm regular citizens
disproportionately, undermining their voice and contribution to our democratic society.

Furthermore, this legislation would impose excessive fines, leading digital service providers
to adopt highly restrictive speech policies, far more stringent than the existing limitations.
This would be compounded by the fact that the code would apply across the entire industry,
leaving no room for alternative perspectives or criticism.

It is essential to acknowledge that the determination of what is considered true or false
information is an incredibly challenging and ever-evolving task. New discoveries continually
challenge once widely accepted facts, as evidenced by a range of examples related to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 narrative has seen various changes, with truths and
falsehoods being revealed, emphasizing the dynamic nature of information.

Moreover, this bill not only targets provably false information but also encompasses
information that is deemed "misleading" or "deceptive." The freedom of speech, a
profoundly valuable aspect of our society, allows for candid and open debates,
acknowledging that individuals can be wrong while encouraging the pursuit of truth. Bills like
this often claim to champion truth over censorship, yet even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former
Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has raised significant concerns about the scope
and execution of this bill. His scathing rebuke further underscores the questionable nature of
this legislation and its impact on our right to express differing opinions.

The proposed bill delegates legislative power to private entities, such as companies
responsible for creating Misinformation Codes. This delegation of power to entities not
directly accountable to Parliament violates the constitutional principle of accountability.
Furthermore, the power granted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) to enact Misinformation Standards and Digital Platform Rules violates the implied
constitutional freedom of political communication. The limitation on legitimate discussions
and debate on vital public policy matters encroaches upon our democratic freedoms and
contradicts the principles on which our democracy is built.

The assumption that the government and accredited media and educational institutions can
solely determine what is true disregards the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary
Australians. Eliminating the diversity of perspectives by silencing certain views as
misinformation or disinformation is detrimental to our sense-making process and stifles the
exploration of all possibilities. This exclusion of ordinary people undermines their role in
shaping public discourse and decision-making.

The implications of this bill on the democratic process are significant, as it restricts citizens'
access to vital information required for making informed voting decisions. By categorizing
political viewpoints as misinformation, crucial perspectives will be eradicated from digital
platforms, leaving voters uninformed. Independent media organizations, journalists, and
bloggers will face a web of complex reporting standards and misinformation reports that
threaten their reputations. This harassment disproportionately favours government-endorsed
publications while stifling opposing and critical perspectives. It is disheartening to consider
that journalists may prioritize favourable coverage or financial gains over objective reporting,
undermining the very essence of journalism.

Australia, as a founding member of the United Nations and a signatory to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, should uphold the fundamental rights enshrined within these
documents. Our Constitution recognizes an individual's right to freedom of thought,
conscience, religion, opinion, and expression. The categorization of fundamental faith
worldviews or tenets as misinformation demonstrates intolerance and disregards these
fundamental rights.

In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This bill threatens the freedom of
speech that is vital to our democracy and unfairly discriminates against regular citizens. It
stifles open and honest discussions, delegates legislative power to private entities, violates
the freedom of political communication, and suppresses diverse viewpoints. As concerned
citizens, we should foster an environment that encourages critical thinking, respectful
dialogue, and the exploration of all perspectives.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take these concerns seriously
and make informed decisions that protect our democratic values.
