# SUBMISSION on Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023

I have significant concern as to whether any submissions opposing this Bill will be properly
considered. I wrote to my local MP, about this Bill several weeks ago,
indicafing my concerns and asking about his stance on it. My correspondence was ignored.

Nevertheless, I suppose I will try here.

This Bill is a very significant incursion into free speech.

We have no idea how misinformafion or disinformafion will be interpreted? What is likely to
cause “serious harm” is likewise completely subjecfive.

It is completely unacceptable to have such interpretafions left to unelected bureaucrats (or
anyone for that mafter – no one person or group of persons should such power over others
as this Bill would give).

One category of harm outlined in the Fact Sheet is, “Harm to the health of Australians.” This
is outrageous. We have just experienced lockdowns and associated business loss and mental
harms, the governments and media emphasis on the need for mass vaccinafions with loss of
employment for those who exercised their choice not to have them, and the associated
harms that flowed to the people who were unlucky enough to experience serious adverse
reacfions. People who spoke out about any of these issues at the fime were demonised and
labelled conspiracy theorists and misinformafion and disinformafion purveyors. What these
people were saying (online and elsewhere) have now been shown to have largely been
correct. Meanwhile, under this proposed legislafion, they could have had fines imposed that
would have the capacity to destroy lives (since the potenfial fines as so ridiculously
astronomical).

All of this is unacceptable.

Another category is “Harm to the Australian environment.” This will clearly potenfially
expose people posfing content that expresses scepficism about the Net Zero agenda or
anything that is contrary to the supposed scienfific “consensus” to be considered to have
posted misinformafion or disinformafion under the pretext of protecfing us from climate
change. Science is a discussion. It evolves. It changes. Scienfists are supposed to challenge
current understandings with new theories which are then looked at and tested – and
somefimes prove to be completely correct. There is no “consensus” in science. It is an
oxymoron. What is happening to the environment and how to best address it is a discussion
– not true informafion and misinformafion or disinformafion. Even assuming that there is a
climate “emergency” as the narrafive tries to tell us, how can speech (in any form) “harm”
the environment? It is outrageous to aftempt to control free speech about a mafter that
affects all humanity in such a manner.

It is completely unacceptable.

Yet another category of harm includes “Hatred against a group in Australian society on the
basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or
mental disability.” Yet again this is completely subjective. Certainly, there may conceivably
be expressions of hatred which would contravene existing laws (so there is no need for
another law). But the word “hatred” can be interpreted very widely, and completely
inappropriately. People pushing the “trans” agenda, and others, routinely accuse others
who they perceive to be questioning of any of their various narratives, of hate speech, when
it is no such thing.

This is unacceptable.

Australia is fast sinking towards totalitarianism and ever fightening government control over
the lives of its cifizens. I never thought I would see this in Australia, but it seems to be
approaching.

Australia has been, and should return to and/or remain, a healthy, funcfioning democracy.

Democracy fundamentally requires freedom of speech, which enables ideas from across the
ideological and polifical spectrum to be discussed and debated. This permits good
arguments, guided by the light of truth, to win out.

Words like harm, misinformafion, and disinformafion have already been weaponised in
Australia to shut down crifics of the broader ideological agenda at work here and other
western nafions. All that happened during COVID is a prime example of all this.

We must not allow any possibility that Australia will be able to advance further into the
abyss by permifting Bills such as this to be passed.

This Bill does not advance the safety and wellbeing of Australians as referred to, in any way,
shape or form – quite the opposite - it has the potenfial to put the safety and wellbeing of
Australians at risk.
