1. The Bill appears to further reinforce the monopoly of established mainstream media enterprises,

which could hinder diversity and competition in the media industry.

2. The Bill risks restricting community access to alternative views and undisclosed facts,

potentially infringing on the public's right to full and diverse information on issues of interest.

3. The implementation and maintenance of the Bill's provisions could place an unnecessary

financial burden on taxpayers due to the establishment of a possibly redundant bureaucracy.

4. The Bill might excessively empower public servants, potentially diminishing the public's ability

to engage critically with and decide on issues of societal importance.

5. By limiting access to a variety of information sources, the Bill could inadvertently enable

entities wishing to manipulate public sentiment towards potentially harmful actions, such as
conflict or war.

6. Recent history has shown instances where powerful political interests and members of the

public service have controlled public opinion and debate through misinformation or
misrepresentation.

7. Media entities protected by monopoly or market privilege should not be further insulated from

emerging alternative platforms or technologies. Diversity is critical for a healthy democratic
discourse.

8. The Bill appears to overlap with existing laws and could potentially undermine pre-existing

common law rights to free speech.

9. The complex nature of the Bill could inherently disadvantage smaller entities and favor well
resourced or government-backed entities, creating potential bias in its application.

10. The creation of misinformation codes could distract organizations from more important

tasks and shift the focus from established common law obligations to an unproven field of
ethics.

11. The Bill's provision for unrestricted power to act on "emerging circumstances" could

infringe upon democratic processes. Public outcry, such as petitions with over 10,000
signatures, should drive action.

12. The Bill should directly and unambiguously define the freedoms protected under

common law and the constitution to prevent further encroachments by judge-made law or
conjecture.

13. Lastly, it is critical to ensure the Bill's alignment with a clearly articulated Bill of Rights

that outlines the sacrosanct rights within the Australian Federation. The enactment of the Bill
should be held off until such a document exists.

I believe that these points warrant serious consideration to ensure the Bill supports a democratic,
diverse, and just society.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Liz Marshall
