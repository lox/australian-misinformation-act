Submission in reference to the

# Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023

This Bill has the potenfial to be used in a way that censors everyday Australians from having their say
freely, we cannot have an open discussion if voices are censored, we may not agree with what other
people say but we should allow open discussion for full transparency!

This Bill will lead us into a one-way road to dictatorship. Never should Australia have such a onesided piece of Legislafion aimed at censoring voices other than what the official narrafive puts out.
The people in Australia can discern and analyse social media, even if they don’t agree with the status
quo. This Legislafion has the potenfial to be a very draconian piece of Legislafion that has no place in
a free and civil society. It asks the quesfion who will oversee this and what could go wrong with such
a broad scope that could be interpreted and made very authoritarian to the point of censoring voices
other than the status quo which would be an assault on free and open discussion which is very much
needed for transparency and accountability. I oppose this legislafion and do not want Australians to
be subjected to it. We do not want propaganda to thrive, we need all voices not just one voice. Who
has the right to dictate to the Australian Communifies what they can and cannot say? There are so
many scenarios where this Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and
Misinformafion) Bill 2023 No., 2023 could go wrong, e.g. What happens if the overseer has ulterior
mofivafions themselves e.g., they have psychopathic mofives, where is the safety mechanisms to
ensure that these things don’t happen. There really is no need for such a Bill. I do not want this
Legislafion also because we do not want to get into a posifion that has people wondering what
subject could be censored next? We must allow conversafions to be free from censorship to allow for
fully transparent discussion both online and offline. These discussions are the lifeblood of democracy
and diplomacy nurturing, understanding, progress and unity Let us keep the flame alive by opposing
this Legislafion.
