Good evening,
Please see my submission response to the "New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation." I am
fine for you to publish my letter and name, but NOT my email address, signature or ANY other personal details. I
would think that the Privacy Act would cover this anyway.
The freedom to express ourselves via free speech, regarding any subject matter may it be expressed with our voice,
written on paper, posted on any social media platform, radio, newspaper or any other form of communication
chosen to do so, is a constitutional right. This right allows individuals to voice their beliefs, ideas and concerns
without fear of retribution. It is through this free exchange of thoughts and opinions that our democracy finds its
strength and resilience, where people are encouraged to participate actively in shaping our collective future.

Each individuals perspective is no more important than any other and collectively we can all drive towards new
solutions to any challenges. By respecting and engaging with differing viewpoints, we create a mutual respect and a
better understanding to reach a common ground for the whole of our society.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Robert Erskine
