**Misinformation and disinformation Legislation Submission**

I am totally against this proposed legislation. I believe both the Federal and State governments
want to play big brother and completely censor us and shut down freedom of expression.

It appears the government has no rules for themselves and we the people will be subjected to big
brother scrutiny and shut down if we should challenge government officials etc. and are found to
be spreading so called ‘misinformation or disinformation’. We will be banned and/or fined for
speaking out and spreading what they deem is untrue.

I don’t believe governments should be excluded from scrutiny and being challenged for speaking
misinformation and untruths themselves? I believe in setting appropriate standards or codes of
conduct for all, including governments. Ordinary people should not be the ones to face bans and
or exorbitant fines. Government officials should be held to account and ‘suffer’ the same
consequences as the people they are serving. I believe ones ability to speak freely should not be
legislated!
