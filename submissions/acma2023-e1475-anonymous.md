The Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (the voluntary code) was
launched on 22 February 2021 by Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI). The code has eight signatories –
Adobe, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Redbubble, TikTok and Twitter

**We are seeking your views on the Exposure Draft Bill, particularly:**

**• the definitions of misinformation and disinformation**

**• the definition of digital platform services and the types of services we propose be subject to the**
**new framework**

**• how instant messaging services will be brought within the scope of the framework while**
**safeguarding privacy.**

**• the scope of the information-gathering and recording keeping powers, which includes the**
**prevalence of false, misleading or deceptive information on digital platform services**

**• the preconditions that must be met before the ACMA can require a new code, register a code**
**and make an industry standard**

**• how the digital platforms industry may be able to operationalise the Bill and various content**
**exemptions (e.g. professional news, satire, authorised electoral content) • appropriate civil**
**penalties and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance.**

**The preconditions that must be met before the ACMA can require a new code, register a code and**
**make an industry standard**

**Appropriate civil penalties and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance. Communications**
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Reply: You cannot bring internet instant messaging into this bill. It is a breech of privacy.
Conversations between individuals are private and do not belong in the realm of government
intervention, reporting or record keeping.

Do the exemptions listed give the government the right to use media to decide what people can say,
do and believe? Where is this bill taking we the people? Who does this bill serve?

**This bill mentions Appropriate civil penalties and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance –**
So the ACMA is a Judge, a jury, a policing body, a punishment and enforcement body? We already
have the Constitution, we have Laws that protect the people, remedies can be found within the
laws. This bill is a waste of tax payers money, this bill does not serve the people and should be
abolished.

Control over what people can or cannot say is not democratic. People can say and believe what they
want to believe, as long as they do not harm to themselves or others. Follow the ‘No Harm Rule’.

Control over what people can believe, say or cannot say poses a threat to the safety and well-being
of Australians as well as to our democracy, society and economy.

No person, no government, no company, no corporation or body should have power to monitor
others, to control what people can say or cannot say, and keep records.

The Proposed bill giving ACME power to gather information, and keep records is a breech of privacy

The word enforce has been used a number of times….Any government or any other controlling body
that decides what Misinformation and disinformation is, and then seeks to enforce its standards
poses a threat to freedom of speech, to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our
democracy, society and economy.

I do not see anything in the bill that protects people from having their accounts on digital platforms
hacked into. The misinformation and disinformation bill does not serve the people, it violates the
rights and freedoms of the people and must be abolished.
