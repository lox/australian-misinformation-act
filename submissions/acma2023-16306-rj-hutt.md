# Submission to the Proposed Misinformation and Discrimination Legislation

I vehemently oppose this legislation. If it successfully becomes the law, it will establish a bureaucratic
Committee possessing an unfettered discretion to determine what is or is not a genuine contribution
to community debate. It alone would have the power to prosecute its decisions and impose
substantial penalties without recourse to appropriate legal processes to defend an adverse
determination. In short it would be the sole arbiter of the truth!

Social media websites would also be exposed to prosecution and significant fines for allowing public
comments on their sites the Committee would likely consider to be the subject of their adjudication,
creating a quasi-regulatory effect that would influence media operators not to publish material that
may become the subject of the Committee’s attention. A further indirect method of controlling free
speech.

The legislation is a brazenly outrageous attempt to regulate free speech. Through the federal
government’s ability to appoint a committee membership favourably disposed to its political
intentions and exempting itself from the scope of the Committee’s powers, it effectively allows the
government of the day to publish material and opinions in the social arena exempt from the
Committee’s decision that would be inclined by the public to be accepted as fact due to the effective
prevention of public scrutiny for fear of prosecution.

The subject scope of the proposed legislation is also unlimited but more importantly determined by
the Committee without redress. Following is an excerpt from the draft legislation relating the scope
of “Harm”.

“Harm means any of the following:7
(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of
ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age,9
religion or physical or mental disability;10
(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;11
(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of12
Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government13
institutions;14
(d) harm to the health of Australians;15
(e) harm to the Australian environment;16
(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian17
economy or a sector of the Australian economy.”

What are the limitations of “public order or society”? Most contentious issues relate to this subject
matter. Does this mean comments opposing young children being exposed to explicit sexual material
or gender change information in schools be considered a “disruption” or an infringement an
“infringement of public order”.

Does “harm to the Australian environment” include the elimination of debate opposing climate
change issues or the rebuttal of radical environmental directions advocated advanced by Green
activists.
“(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian
economy.” can be construed to encompass a multitude of subject matters all of which can be
determined by the Committee!

It is vital this legislation must be opposed, to endorse it would effectively succumb to surrendering
free speech as we know it.
