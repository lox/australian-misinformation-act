# Let Us Not Fear Speech

Upon invitation from the Department of Communications et alia, conducting an investigation into the
draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, concerning what comments the Australian public will be permitted to freely
make, I request that the following proposal be taken into consideration.

Philip Lillingston,

Proposal
That the current Australian government

dispenses with the idea of further violating
Australians’ right to free speech, as defined
below, and appreciate that not only is it not
omniscient and has no justification to know what is scientifically or morally absolutely true, but that
an honest and well-meaning government, like honest and well-meaning people, should have no reason
to fear what others say.

## What Free Speech Means

What is free speech?
Speech where the speaker is expressing an honestly held
political, religious, demographic, historical opinion, or opinion
as a part of formal or informal academic study.

What is not free Speech?

1. Libel or slander,
2. Comments threatening or advocating criminal violence,
3. Comments the speaker unquestionably knows are false

but are made to cause harm to listeners who believe they
might be true,

4. Obscenity or Pornography,
5. Copyright violation, trade secrets, harmful or dishonest

product labelling, violation of oaths or contracts.

What type of right is free speech?

**Negative right**
Free speech is what is called a negative right. As compared to
positive rights where the claimant has a right to a financial or
otherwise benefit, a negative right is the right of self-mastery to
do, or refrain from doing, an action, or otherwise be free from
interference.
The right of free speech does not mean that the claimant must
be granted a soapbox and megaphone, or that a publisher must broadcast whatever his journalists opine,
but only that the speaker cannot be denied using his own soapbox, website or newsletter.

**Protection from whom?**

The right of free speech is only exercised as a
protection against government or its agencies. This
is not to say that non-government entities have a
right to use force to violate one’s free speech, but
only that laws already exist to prevent such
coercion or damage to property, and where laws or
contracts are not broken, one citizen does have the
right to prevent other citizens from speaking.
“The freedom [of speech] is a freedom from
governmental action; it is not a right to require others
to provide a means of communication.”  Hayne, J,
_McClure v Australian Electoral Commission (1991) HCA_

the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.

-words from George Orwell's proposed preface to Animal Farm

- “In a time of universal deceit - telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.” -George Orwell

- "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't

like. Dictators such as Stalin and Hitler, were in favour of freedom of speech for views they
liked only. If you're in favour of freedom of speech, that means you're in favour of freedom of
speech precisely for views you despise". -Noam Chomsky

- "To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those

of the speaker." -Frederick Douglass

Hitchens.

- If freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the

slaughter.

- "When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward - or go

back. He who now talks about the 'freedom of the press' goes backward, and halts our headlong
course towards Socialism." -Vladimir Lenin
