I hold grave concerns for the future of our democracy and our right to freedom of speech if

this bill were to pass. When a government forcibly or otherwise restricts our freedom to

move, our freedom of opinion and speech and freedom over our bodily autonomy, we no

longer live in a democratic society and we have become ruled by a communist regime that

we once demonised. I fully reject this Bill in its entirety.
