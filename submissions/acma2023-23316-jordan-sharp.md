To whom it may concern,

This Communications Legislation Amendment has the following issues in the exposure draft.

6 (1) (b) Excluding media services without interactive features serves no legitimate purpose as it
continues to allows the spread of misinformation and disinformation in print news and television,

some of the main sources of news in Australia.

6 (1) (c) Enables government to exempt harmful disinformation and misinformation from the
proposed legislation.

6 (2) Same as above.

7 (1 & 2) There is no discussion of who makes these distinctions, a professional and independent
body would be needed, and even these are not immune from misjudgements or vested interests.

Australians make these judgements effectively everyday, the problem of misinformation and
disinformation is more appropriately handled through Australian's critical thinking skills - obtained
through the education system.

I suggest a focus in schools is a more effective long term solution.

7 (e) If misinformation and disinformation are defined incorrectly and then used for legal action this
will have a chilling effect on public discourse and weaken our democracy.

Political donors have a financial incentive to lobby for it to be defined incorrectly in their favor.

It is noted that in 6 government Minister chosen sources, television and print news services are
exempted and hence would be allowed to spread harmful and deceiving misinformation and
disinformation.

17 & 18 Applying onerous record keeping requirements or large fines to all information providers on
the internet will remove valuable small sources that do not have the resources to comply.

Enforcement over all providers on the entire internet is logistically impossible and is an
unreasonable burden to place on the taxpayer.

Misinformation Codes can be used as a tool for information warfare by government and noninteractive digital services with impunity.
