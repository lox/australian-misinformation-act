Communications Legislation Amendment

(Combating misinformation and disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

#### “When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar,

_you're_ _only_ _telling_ _the_ _world_ _that_ _you_ _fear_ _what_ _he_ _might_ _say."_

_-_ _George_ _R._ _R._ _Martin*_

I am writing to register my strong opposition to the "Communications Legislation Amendment

(Combating misinformation and disinformation) Bill 2023"      - hereafter known as the Bill.

When I sat down and read through the contents of this Bill, visions of George Orwell's book "1984"

came flooding back. Restrictions to speech via broadcasting mediums, social media forums, websites

containing blog posts with public comment, are just some of the many communications fora that will

fall under the purview of the Australian Communications Media Authority (ACMA). All this, while

Governments, Professional News Organisations and Accredited Education Institutions are given a free

pass21 . I'm sure George Orwell never envisaged his book "1984" would become the user manual for a

proposed Bill in the Australian Parliament, paid for by the Australian tax payer      - but here we are.

In my submission, I would like to point out three areas of serious contention, that (in my opinion)

should either be amended or struck out, should this Bill ever be voted upon and enacted.

1) Education             - specifically, foreign influence of,

2) Social Media, and

3) Referendum            - specifically, how this Bill affects public discourse

# Education

_"The_ _public_ _is_ _not_ _cognisant_ _of_ _the_ _real_ _value_ _of_ _education,_ _and_

_does_ _not_ _realise_ _that_ _education_ _as_ _a_ _socialforce_ _is_ _not_ _receiving_

_the_ _kind_ _of_ _attention_ _it_ _has_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _expect_ _in_ _a_ _democracy."_

_-_ _Edward_ _Bernays3_

I would like to refer to the current Definition of **"excluded** **content** **for** **misinformation** **purposes"**

on Page 9 of the Bill. In clause (d) it states :

(d) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited:

(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor of

educational institutions; and

(ii) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable Australian educational institution;

#### It is one thing to exclude educational institutions accredited by Federal, Local and State

Governments from "misinformation". But why should accredited educational institutions from foreign

governments be afforded the same privilege? You only have to look at the education curricula from

countries such as United States and Canada to realise that their education systems are in a total mess.

Does our Federal and State Governments also want to indoctrinate our school kids with woke

ideology, critical race theory and gender affirming indoctrination? Teaching kids the aforesaid

doctrines represents a dumbing-down of future generations, effectively making employment

opportunities for highly skilled jobs obsolete. Whatever happened to teachers teaching the three R's

principle (reading, writing, arithmetic) in order for their students to better prepare for life outside of

the education system?

**Recommendation** **:** Remove clause (d) in the Definition "excluded content for misinformation

purposes".

# Social Media

#### “Censorship is saying: Tm the one who says the last sentence.

_Whatever_ _you_ _say,_ _the_ _conclusion_ _is_ _mine.'_ _But_ _the_ _internet_ _is_ _like_ _a_

_tree_ _that_ _is_ _growing._ _The_ _people_ _will_ _always_ _have_ _the_ _last_ _word_ _-_

_even_ _if_ _someone_ _has_ _a_ _very_ _weak,_ _guiet_ _voice._ _Such_ _power_ _will_

_collapse_ _because_ _of_ _a_ _whisper.”_ _-_ _Ai_ _Weiwei4_

As an IT professional with over 35 years experience in the Information Technology space, I know a

#### thing or two when it comes to the internet - including Social Media. As someone who develops, hosts

and manages websites on the internet, I am more than concerned how individuals who post content

on websites will now come under the purview of ACMA, if this Bill is enacted in its current form.

The Bill makes clear that:

              - "content is provided on a digital service if the content is ... accessible to end-users using the

digital service"5 ; and

              - "a service is provided to the public if... the service is provided to at least one person outside

the immediate circle ... of the person who provides the service"6 .

The above definitions, taken together, means that an individual who posts content online that's

accessible to more than one other person, that individual will be captured by the various powers the

Bill grants ACMA. That individual (any Australian citizen who posts something online) would need to

comply with any digital platform rules, or misinformation codes or standards, that ACMA implements

under the Bill. That individual would also be subject to the severe civil and criminal penalties that the

Bill implements if those codes/standards are breached.

The Bill not only flagrantly dismisses the Australian citizenry's rights to freedom of speech and

expression (as outlined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)7
#### - of which Australia is a signatory); it also subjects them to future regulatory frameworks unilaterally

imposed by ACMA, with no recourse on such decisions. The internet is meant to be a marketplace of

ideas, where an individuals freedom of speech and expression can be expressed freely in a digital

#### form. Australia can no longer consider itself a functioning democracy if its citizenry is unable to

express their opinions openly, without the fear of Government-led civil and/or criminal prosecution.

**Recommendation** **:** Amend the definition of'digital service' to exclude Australian citizens posts on

digital platforms, so that this requirement falls outside the scope of the Bill's operation.

# Referendum

_"Drafting_ _a_ _constitution_ _is_ _only_ _the_ _first_ _step._ _The_ _constitution_ _has_

_to_ _be_ _granted_ _legitimacy_ _by_ _open_ _discussion_ _and_ _a_ _fair,_

_representative_ _referendum._ _-_ _Emma_ _Bonino8_

As of writing this Submission, a fixed date has not yet been set for the Referendum on The Voice.

Contentious as it has been in the media, my focus with this Submission will be on the timing of this

Bill, and how its implementation will muzzle free flowing debate on the Referendum.

Currently, the Referendum is set down for sometime between October 2023 and December 2023.

With the exception of services outside of the misinformation scope9, this Bill affects all other means of

digital communication for Australian citizens, whilst giving a free pass to governments, main-stream

media and accredited education institutions10. If in the event the Bill is passed and enacted prior to the

Referendum date, there would be nothing stopping ACMA establishing disinformation /

#### misinformation policies surrounding discussion of the Referendum onto Digital Platform Services,

such that only one side of the Referendum debate will be heard and discussed.

When Australian citizens are making a choice that affects the wording of our Constitution, ALL

Australians deserve to be informed of the pros and cons, as to how it will affect them, to the extent

they so wish. A Referendum cannot be considered a free and fair choice, if Digital Platform Services are

unduly influenced by ACMA's misinformation / disinformation policies, in-so-doing, limiting free speech

and expression. Let Australian citizens make their own choice come Referendum Day. They **don't**

#### want, nor need, a government body to help decide for them.

**Recommendation** **:** For any Government-run Referendums (and/or Elections), Digital Platform

Service11 should fall outside of the Misinformation and Disinformation12 scope of the Bill.

## In Summary

While my Submission is concise, I have outlined areas of this Bill that have serious shortcomings.

1. Foreign influence of Australia's Education System            - Accredited Federal, State and Independent

education systems should be free from any foreign government influence. We don't need woke

ideology infecting our education systems.

2. Social Media           - the Bill is overly broad, far reaching and punitive on the Australian citizenry. The

Bill also flagrantly dismisses the Australian citizenry's rights to freedom of speech and

expression, as outlined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

(ICCPR)13           - of which Australia is a signatory.

3. Referendum & Elections           - the timing of this Bill raises serious concerns as to whether

Australian citizenry will (in future) be adequately informed when they cast their vote, be it

Referendums or Elections. Will Australians continue to get a free and fair choice? Or will

Australians' voting decisions be overtly influenced by Government Bureaucrats? Time will tell.

In its current form, the Bill is not only unworkable and illogical, it also lacks understanding and due

care for the human rights of Australians. Minor amendments will not be enough to save this Bill.

Should such laws be enacted, there is little doubt that complex litigation would ensue. The impact on

Australia's legal system could prove to be detrimental to the administration of the entire legal system.

As it stands, I fundamentally and vehemently oppose this Bill. If such law is allowed to pass, it will

not only sound the death knell of the internet as a free marketplace of ideas in Australia, it will also

send a strong signal to citizens around the globe that the Australian Government is now the "New

China" as far as dissemination of information within its borders is concerned. That would be a dark

day, were such a thing to pass.

Sincerely,

Tom Thorp
