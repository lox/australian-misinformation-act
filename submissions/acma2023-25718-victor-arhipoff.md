# Submission to Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

## I wish to have my say on the proposed Communications Legislation
### Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I strongly disagree to this bill being presented before Parliament as I believe the following are inconsistent and are infringing on the freedom of speech that Australians have enjoyed. 

 1. Who determines what is misinformation and Disinformation? (What is truth and what is not truth) as science is forever changing, what is truth one day may be proven incorrect another day and what is classed as misinformation one day found out to be true later. We have seen the evidence of this over the last 3 years. Many people who were publishing information which was called misinformation or disinformation ended up being proven correct. 

 2.We as electors and Adults over the age of 18 years of age have the ability to search out and determine what is truth and what is not. We as Australians do not need the Government or an external Body to treat us like children trying to so called protect us from information that they deem to be misinformation. We have the ability to decipher these things for ourselves as mature Australian people. 

 3. Why is it that the only exempt parties to these proposed legislation is the Federal and State governments as well as the mainstream media? The Bill of Rights 1688 was written because of the Tyrannical King that would not allow the Parliament to question or criticize the Crown. Because of that Legislation which is still current to this day in Australian Law, the parliaments throughout this nation can speak freely without fear of prosecution before a court even if the information proves to be false. My conviction is that all Australians should have this right and privilege not just Politicians. In America they have this establish in their Constitution as the first amendment and this was upheld recently when the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal government could not establish a similar bill to this

### bill being proposed. This set a precedence that many could in fact use as in a court of law as common law case precedence. 

 4. Allowing only Mainstream media as an exemption is dangerous as this is what happens in communist countries. As a direct descendant from a family who escaped from a communist country I well and truly know the dangers of only allowing the voice of mainstream media and no independent media reporters allowing to bring all perspectives on a matter. I always truly believed that the Commonwealth of Australia is a democracy where every subject of the Queen as written in our Constitution has the privilege of being able to talk about all things without fear of being charged and locked up. This proposed legislation is the beginning of a slippery slope toward communism in my view. You might even class this comment as disinformation. 

 5. Last of all can you show, we the Australian people, where the Head of Power is for The Parliament to bring in this legislation . 

 Kind Regards

 Victor Arhipoff
