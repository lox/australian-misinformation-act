I write feeling incensed that anybody would even contemplate bringing such a bill into our legislation. This would be nothing
short of a direct assault on freedom of speech in Australia. Every person in this great nation is entitled to their own viewpoint
on any issue. I or anybody else is equally fully entitled to disagree with that person’s position but that is a sign of a healthy
democracy. What is being proposed is scarily similar to George Orwell’s projected “ Ministry of Truth”. Given the suggested
size of any fines issued to the social media companies, amongst others, this proposed bill would usher in full censorship with
all its negative consequences. Our government should not be given the powers to decide what is true or false-that is extreme
government overreach. To clamp down on any individual who exercises his or her freedom of speech because the position
disagrees with the government position or agenda is an unacceptable position for all Australians.

I strongly urge that this proposed bill be withdrawn with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully,

George Lee
