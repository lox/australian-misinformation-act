My name is Catherine Taylor. You have my permission for public submission with only my name but
not my personal details

Below is my submission to prevent “representafives working for this government agency. ACMA or
any government body or corporafion, deciding what is “Misinformafion or Disinformafion” on Social
Media Plafforms, then censoring them. By doing so, removing healthy debate and other viewpoints.

I reject strongly that ACMA would even consider this censorship, to formulate a bill to present to
Parliament disavowing our free speech rights as a human being.

Choosing for me and others what we can hear or say or see on social media is an affront to our
sovereignty to choose for myself and be responsible for my choices, not including what is already
restricted by ACMA and Law enforcement. Fundamentally people have human frailfies, opinions and
structured beliefs that interpret what is “misinformafion or disinformafion.” This decision to decide
for us would be an Orwellian trajectory. ACMA would be seen to be moving towards a totalitarian
stance. The irony is that such power in a few persons hands:

A) Has been proved in the past two or more years, classified as “Misinformafion and
Disinformafion dictates, totally incorrect. The Mis or Dis informafion came instead via
Government implemented or social media “fact checkers”, guardians of the gate.
using his FB has admifted to this collaborafion with Government.

The “Safe and Effecfive” vaccine mantra, spouted by the Government and Mains Stream
Media has been called out. Now both are back peddling to reduce the horrendous
implicafions this censorship has caused, impacfing our health, our communifies and
businesses.
Opposing or dissenfing views once removed from social media, are being reinstated. Truth
will out but the damage is done.

B) Then there is the discriminafion or Hypocrisy “so in your face” that it is laughable and
demeaning to its cifizens”: The Government is exempfing itself from such censorship on
Social Media Plafforms. What members of Government states is factual would not or cannot
be” Misinformafion or Disinformafion”. This intended ACMA bill will not apply to our
government
We have the Fox guarding the Hen House. One law for us, another for them.

C) The slide may confinue, Next: what we say is viewed as “Misinformafion, Disinformafion “
Spies, our neighbours, family are rewarded for telling on us. Enforcement or punishments
employed i.e freezing our bank accounts, like the truckers in Canada and the people who
gave them food. This happened, is a fact and not as MSM says a fabricafion. One step closer
is happening now.

ACMA please see this for what it is a flawed and possibly dangerous aberrafion of power becoming
the gate keepers for all Social Media plafforms under the cover of this intended Bill.

It is not on my behalf or “We the People’s” behalf but is driven by your appointees requesfing this.
Uphold our freedom to discern for ourselves what is truth. What is even worse there is no avenue or
way to claw our freedom to choose informafion back should you put this Bill forward and it is passed.
