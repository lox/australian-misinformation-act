manifesto at election time.

**This Bill represents a direct violation of our human rights under the UNHCR Declaration of Human Rights, Articles**
**19 and 20:**

_Article 19_

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without_
_interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers._

_Article 20_

_1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association._

Who is the arbiter of truth? Government or the people?

**The only truth we can truly access is in freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and in public debate.**

Muzzling "big tech" is censorship. It’s autocratic and dictatorial. The government’s function is to serve the people,
not their own agendas. They are not capable of determining misinformation or disinformation, because information
is dynamic. It is never a set imperative.

It is no small thing that this bill is "just for big tech" companies. The online media platforms have become the
preferred way of accessing news for many people and is where you can find alternative sources of information to the
mainstream media.

Each of the major previously trusted news channels such as the ABC, the commercial channels and Fox, have their
own rigid political agendas. They each have a different puppet master. Independent journalism has all but
disappeared, which is why we look to alternative sources for information. This is where people are able to discuss
and share peer-reviewed, scientific data, which the mainstream media has ignored. It is where courageous
independent investigative journalists are bringing to light information that governments and bureaucracies have
stymied.

It is the only place where truth can prevail. It is the only place, where we can question and hold our government to
account.

If Australia is to remain free and democratic, please oppose this bill. Or look to a future where your children will own
nothing. They won’t own their own thoughts. They won’t own their medicated bodies.

If you want your children to be blissfully ignorant and unquestionably compliant then vote in favour.
