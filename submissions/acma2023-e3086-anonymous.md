Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am against this proposed legislation. The draft talks about keeping Australians safe from “harm” but the government
is responsible for protecting the rights of the individual, not suppressing them.

The rationale for censorship might have been well-intentioned but freedom of speech is a basic human right!

I may not agree with what another person says but I will fight to defend their right to say it.

This bill must be thrown out.
