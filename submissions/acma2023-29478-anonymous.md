To whom this may concern,

I oppose government and its subsidiary agencies (ACMA) imposing their views
on the Australian public via social media regulations, in what it deems as truth or
misinformation/ disinformation. This is a dangerous path that assumes only
government knows the truth and must impose that truth on its citizens.

Much like Nazi Germany, the “Combatting misinformation and disinformation”
bill seeks to censor the general publics ability to access a wide variety of
viewpoints and penalize those that share differing views than the government.

For example, censorship under Hitler included:

  - Controlling what news appeared in newspapers, on the radio, and in
newsreels; or in modern times - Social media outlets, news websites

  - Banning and burning books that the Nazis categorized as un-German;

  - Controlling what soldiers wrote home during World War II.

The above listed censorship is occurring today in various forms and all under the
umbrella of “keeping people safe” from “misinformation”.

Please consider it is the censorship itself that creates mistrust, not the sharing of
differing viewpoints now labelled as “misinformation”. If the argument is sound
it should stand up to all questions.

Instead of censoring opposing views why not promote healthy and robust
discourse, this is the fastest way to build trust.

Ultimately “Censorship is the child of fear and the father of ignorance”

Laurie Halse Anderson

This bill should gain no powers.

Thank you for your consideration.
