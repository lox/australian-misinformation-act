 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
 I agree wholeheartedly with the statement that, “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”
 However, this proposed legislation is pointed in the wrong direction. I have been keenly following world and Australian politics for 60 years and have come to the conclusion that the major purveyors of misinformation are governments and their various agencies and the mainstream media. In fact, this is one of their core functions.
 A couple of brief examples.
 During the Vietnam War, the Australian Government claimed the US Government had asked Australia to send troops. This was later proved to be a lie. At the same time, the Australian Government claimed we were being threatened by China – we had to stop China in Vietnam. Of course, the Vietnam War nothing but CIA drug war (like the later war in Afghanistan).
 So, yes, this legislation is needed – but definitely not for its currently intended purpose.
