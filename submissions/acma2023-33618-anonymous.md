I am writing a submission to provide my opinion in regards to the proposed legislation to provide
the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with new powers to combat online
misinformation and disinformation.

I have never written a submission before but I absolutely vehemently disagree with the premises
that this Draft Bill is based on.

Australia is a free country and this is an attack on our right to free speech in a democratic society.

What determines MIsinformation/Disinformation? It is much too broad a term. I do not need
ACMA to have these superior powers to sensor any information from me. I can discern for myself
what information I choose to take on board. It makes an absolute mockery of the Australian
population to have this level of control over what information we can access.

Progress is made when opposing views can be debated. Scientific advancements occur when
there are opposing opinions. This Bill will squash that.

I hope that you will take into account the many submissions you will obviously receive on this
topic. This is not what the people want.

Thank you.
