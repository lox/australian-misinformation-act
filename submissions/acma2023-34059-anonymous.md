Public Comment Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

To whom it may concern,

I am deeply concerned that the proposed new powers will threaten freedom of speech and
democratic rights in Australia in the following ways:

  - The Bill grants the government the authority to define truth, allowing them to
control and manipulate the flow of information.

  - Whilst imposing restrictions on online platforms, the Bill gives the government and
mainstream media a free pass, creating a double standard and eroding the principles
of fairness and equality.

  - The Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to
determine what qualifies as “misinformation” or “disinformation”. This subjective
definition leaves room for abuse of power, and suppresses public debate and diverse
opinions and perspectives.

  - The Bill effectively enables tech companies to become tools of government
censorship, stifling free speech and undermining the open exchange of ideas.

  - The Bill paves the way for ideological conformity, suppressing dissenting voices and
hindering independent thought. This goes against the principles of a democratic
society that thrives on diversity and freedom of expression.

  - The Bill has the ability to silence just and evidence based scientific debate, which is
the founding framework for modern scientific advancement, by suppressing any
discussion that goes against the ideology of the government and its agents.

I urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental rights of every
Australian citizens as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Everyone has the
**_right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions_**
_without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any_
_media and regardless of frontiers._
Anything less will cause serious, detrimental, implications for free speech and democracy in
Australia. We urge the Australian government to uphold the principles of transparency and
accountability, and foster an environment where open debate and diverse opinions are
welcome.
