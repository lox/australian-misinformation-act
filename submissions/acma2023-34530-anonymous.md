     The proposed bill is a threat to small businesses and freedom of ideas. I oppose
     it utterly and totally.
     1.
     It is a threat to small businesses that use their own small public forums
     ("digital platforms"), because the extra record -keeping and the extra safety
     measures required to keep that record -keeping secure might prove to be too great
      a burden for them.
     Such record -keeping would also make it harder for new digital platforms to start
      up, enforcing existing monopolies of Facebook and its elk.
      Add to that the fines for imperfect record -keeping and nobody smaller than an
     American giant would be able to shoulder any open information sharing. 1-to-1
     chats are fine, in some countries they are the only safe way to share
     information - but I'd prefer Australia to be a classic open -forum-idea-sharing
     country.
     2.
     It is a threat to freedom of ideas, because any new idea will be called heresy
      by existing specialists. Remember Wright brothers, who believed in
     heavier-than-air aircraft? Florence Nightingale, who extolled the virtues of
     sanitation in army hospitals? Public ridicule was bad enough, but what if their
     thoughts had been proclaimed "illegal" and "misinformation"? How would their
     contributions to science ever happen?
      Add to that the aforementioned extra pressure on open sources of chatting and
     it's a recipe for disaster.
     3.
     The bill is also very questionable in its scope and powers:
     * "The Bill aims to incentivise digital platform providers to have robust
     systems and measures in place to address misinformation and disinformation on
     their services, rather than the ACMA directly regulating individual pieces of
     content. The Bill does not seek to curtail freedom of speech, nor is it intended
     that powers will be used to remove individual pieces of content on a platform."
     " the ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be
      removed from digital platform services"
     Yet, from 4.4.1, ACMA would have the power to request mandatory codes of conduct
     that will force the digital platform to... do things... as yet unspecified,
      which just _might_ include removal of such pieces of information. The bill is
      kinda writing out an open cheque to ACMA for future increase of scope. No,
     thanks, folk tales abound of troubles starting with promises of "a tiny thing,
     I'll tell you later what it is".
     * "Authorised electoral communications and electoral and referendum content will
      be out of scope of the code and standard -making powers"

      Even though an election candidate is using his/her words to affect the election
     outcome and the direction of country's policies for years to come, even though
      broken election promises are the subject of jokes all over the world,
      politicians' words can never constitute misinformation under this act? No matter
     the seriousness of harm or the size of the lie? That is not fair.
     * The basis of the act lies in the definitions of "harm" and "misinformation",
      right? Everything else is built up from there. Well, some examples to show how
     ludicrous the concept is:
     "harm to the health of Australians" - Many people would've said that Florence
      Nightingale was harming the soldiers by wasting time on cleaning. In other
     times, when a churn-blessed rag would be used over and over again, the charge
      would've been "washing off the blessings".
     "the content contains information that is false, misleading or 7 deceptive" -
     "Earth moving about the Sun and not being the centre of the Universe" was known
     as "blasphemy". "USSR having faults" was "misinformation" in the 60-70-es and
     grounds for 5+ years of jail. "Russia invaded Ukraine" and "Russia is at war"
      ARE CURRENTLY "misinformation and blatant lies" in Russian lawbook, mentioning
     either concept on a digital platform (or anywhere else) is grounds for 5+ years
     of jail.
      Cat's "dinner" is mouse's "harm". Mouse's "dinner" can be man's "has no idea"
     (out in a forest clearing), "good news" (if the mouse is an endangered species)
     or "big trouble" (if the mouse is in the house). Who defines what constitutes
     "harm"?
      Who says what is false? who says what is true? who has the right to define
     "truth" and "goodness"? George Orwell had written a lot on the topic. Russia and
      North Korea and China are showing a lot of the "single source of truth" ideas he
      had written about in real-life practice. Australia is better than that. Fighting
      mistakes with information and public discussion is reasonable. Somebody on top
     deeming some information correct and fighting all other statements with a law is
      a step towards censorship, "1984" and "thoughtcrimes".
      The "Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
     Disinformation) Bill 2023" should stay a non-enacted draft.
     20 August 2023.
