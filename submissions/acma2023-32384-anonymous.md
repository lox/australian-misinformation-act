**Re: Submission on the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Let me start by saying the fact that any political party would introduce a bill like this that will
in effect will create a “Ministry of Truth” to police language shows just how far down the
slippery slope towards a totalitarian dystopia Australia has come over the last decade.

The Morrison Government’s complete over-reaction to the recent pandemic, cheered on
enthusiastically by every Labor State Premier, was a perfect example of the disaster we can
expect if people are denied the right to speak freely and truthfully about the issues that
concern them.

For example, during the pandemic government actions significantly increased the suffering
of millions of ordinary Australians. Mask mandates, vaccination mandates, lockdowns and
many other policies that have proven to be ineffective and even dangerous in the past were
implemented again with tragic results.

One particularly heinous instance was the decision to disallow any form of early Covid
treatment using safe and effective drugs that were having incredible success in treating
Covid patients in many other parts of the World.

This one policy mistake may have caused the unnecessary deaths of thousands. Many mildly
ill people were left untreated until they became so sick they were placed on ventilators and
given painkillers until they died. With proper early treatment, many of these people would
have completely recovered.

While this public health disaster was taking place, countless experts, scientists, professors,
doctors and other smart, concerned people shared unequivocal evidence that these policies
where wrong, dangerous and in many cases deadly. However, they were mercilessly
attacked, ridiculed, sacked, vilified, de-funded and cancelled for trying to warn about the
negative consequences of the government’s policies.

It is only now that many of the people who were attacked for contradicting the preferred
narrative have been proven to be correct on virtually every issue, and the governments’
actions were shown to be consistently wrong, unscientific, dangerous and in many cases
deadly.

After such a miserable public policy failure, to contemplate giving any government the
unfettered power to determine the “Truth” on any issue, when governments have proven to
be so catastrophically wrong on so many issues, defies belief.

**This legislation must be withdrawn and never reintroduced in ANY form because it will**
**supress honest, accurate, factual speech. Such misguided policy will stop people raising**
**legitimate issues where government decisions are obviously wrong-headed, dangerous, or**
**illegal, and has the potential to permanently damage Australian society.**
