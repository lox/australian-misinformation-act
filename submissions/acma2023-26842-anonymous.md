# 5. It is our conviction and we do solemnly declare;

 a) Politicians are a principal source of misinformation and
 disinformation for the community of people in Australia, aided and abetted by the news sources commonly referred to as the mainstream media. One example is the oft-repeated statement, further imposed upon the will of the people, throughout the years 2020 and 2021; the claim 'mandates' have lawful substance or even legal substance.

 b) The following mainstream news source is used to substantiate
 item a)

 be proportionate, fair, reasonable and equitable. Therefore, it may only have force and substance if equally binding upon all media and news outlets, and all public or recorded statements by politicians.

 sources, the Bill is a manifestation of the ideology known as fascism.

 e) The proposed Bill is an instrument for censorship and
 oppression, nothing less.

 f) A government of strength does not fear the free speech of the
 people.

 g) Therefore, a government employing censorship is weak;
 questions its own authority; fears the might of people; and assumes a questionable ethical foundation.

 h) Any member of Parliament not actively dissenting by voting
 against this Bill, and instead voting in favour or abstaining, is

 Totalitarianism.

 and 21st Centuries fought against the values espoused by Fascist and Totalitarian governments,which also relied upon censorship.

 k) Any member of Parliament not actively dissenting by voting
 against this Bill, and instead voting in favour or abstaining; is opposed to the values the soldiers of the Australian Defence Force sought to protect, by fighting against Fascism and Totalitarianism.

 l) The outcome of this Bill in practical terms is an internet existing

Which is to say, if I, my partner, and my two children are affected by information I personally am unable to access for the good of my family, owing to censorship by this proposed Bill, the Service Fee applies per four affected individuals. Minimum rate applicable per incident = 3 x 24 hour periods.

 f) As publishers of content on the internet, this Bill proposes we
 self-police and self-regulate our content, and be ever vigilant to the proposed nature of our content. Bringing rise to the known,documented psychological influence termed the 'chilling effect'. Known to be an actively detrimental and harmful condition.

 g) As publishers of content on the internet, our Service Fee for
 self-policing, self-regulating our content, is Five Hundred Thousand Australian Dollars per 24 hour period or part thereof. Minimum rate applicable = 3 x 24 hour periods.
