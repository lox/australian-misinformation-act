Throughout history there have been many book burnings. These were conducted by radical
governments or leaders that wanted to destroy any difference in opinion to their own
ideologies.

Such practices, today are viewed as tyrannical and a violation of ones ability to question and
seek truth through differences of opinion. Fastforward to the modern digital world; there is
very little difference from book burning to a government squashing online content that it
determines as mis/disinformation. Censorship of information that differs from the current
governing body is neither helpful or beneficial to a society that wants to advance.
Advancement comes from healthy debate not a single viewpoint.

The worrying thing is who or what decides what is factual or fiction. Despite mankind being
on this planet for thousands of years, our current government canâ€™t even define what a
woman is. That is worrisome if these people in power are the arbiters of truth.
