Title: Censorship, Soft and Hard: The Multifaceted Approach to Controlling Narratives

Abstract: This treatise explores the diverse manifestations of censorship employed by governments
and political entities worldwide. It examines both overt and covert forms, highlighting the impact on
public perception and democracy, and includes prominent examples such as authoritarian censorship
regimes and the 'Mediscare' campaign in Australia.

Introduction: Censorship is a powerful tool used by regimes and political entities globally to control
information flow and shape public sentiment. This manipulation ranges from outright suppression of
dissent to the more subtle influence of soft censorship, both forms influencing societal viewpoints and
outcomes. There is a fear that the powers of ACMA will not be transparent and biased with influence,
soft and hard, from Government.

I. Overt Censorship: Overt or hard censorship, prevalent in authoritarian regimes, involves explicit
control over information dissemination. Examples from the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, North
Korea, China, and Saudi Arabia reveal how these regimes leveraged censorship to suppress dissent
and manipulate public perception to maintain power and control.

II. Soft Censorship: On the other end of the spectrum is soft censorship, a subtler form that uses
media, political narratives, and influential figures to mould public opinion and drive political
outcomes. Soft censorship manifests as biased reporting, selective news coverage, favouritism in
public advertising, or unfair allocation of resources that influences media narratives.

III. The Power of Political Narratives: The strategic framing and repetition of specific narratives,
often devoid of factual bases, can profoundly shape public perception and determine political
outcomes. A prime example is the 'Mediscare' campaign by the Australian Labour Party during the
2016 Federal Election, where the party capitalised on the public's concern for the healthcare system,
despite lacking evidence supporting their claim of Medicare privatisation.

IV. The Role of Media: Media entities play a significant role in both perpetuating and counteracting
these forms of censorship. Their coverage can either contribute to the spread of specific narratives or
challenge them by providing alternative viewpoints and fact-checking claims.

Discussion: Whether through explicit suppression of information or through strategic manipulation of
narratives, censorship in its various forms influences public sentiment and shapes the political
landscape. Recognizing both overt and covert tactics of censorship is essential in understanding their
potential to manipulate democratic discourse and infringe on the freedom of speech.

Conclusion: The study of censorship in its various forms underscores the importance of maintaining a
diverse, independent media landscape, and the necessity for an informed and critical populace. As we
continue to engage with the evolving nature of information dissemination and media consumption,
understanding the multifaceted influence of censorship becomes increasingly crucial for preserving a
healthy democracy. If Australia is to grapple with the ever-expanding overreach of government
censors then the argument for a Bill of Rights is evermore well made.
