# Communication on matters of public interest

The proposed bill to combat “misinformation” is an abomination. The censorship regime ignores a
fundamental principle. Communication on matters of public interest is best done in a public
information clearinghouse. This way assertions can be tested in a timely manner. The alternative is
that communication occurs regardless but only in small groups, typically referred to as “the
grapevine” or “rumour mill”. Interventions attempting to correct this communication such as “fact­
checking” fail because they don't have access to the full context or details of the communication      -
the parties to the communication may reject or be totally unaware of the intervention. Over time the
interventions lose credibility in the eyes of dissenters. Perversely, as with the cynical dictum “don't
believe it until it has been denied”, we have to assume “don't believe anything until it has been fact-
checked”. The reason is this      - that a public narrative captured by vested interests will only be
threatened by information that is actually true, hence interventions such as fact-checking will
perversely focus on denouncing true information.

Essentially, the solution to bad free speech is always more free speech. The ACMA censorship
regime goes in the wrong direction.

# Iraq War

Consider happened before the Iraq War. Millions of ordinary people protested on the basis that they
doubted Iraq's alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction existed. People who raised doubts about the
WMD lies were denounced as “appeasers”. The government-sponsored experts assumed the WMDs
did exist, because the US insisted on it, and they all proceeded on that basis. I raise this case to
demonstrate that the list of exemptions to the proposed censorship regime doesn't correlate with an
ability to get important “facts” right. Why does the Australian Government seek to privilege
officially-sponsored conspiracy theories above skepticism expressed by ordinary people?

# Covid

Obviously the inspiration for this proposed censorship regime is the covid period. Dissenters were
fully justified in questioning and contradicting the official response to covid. Yet under the proposed
censorship regime official information is privileged over even well-founded skepticism by ordinary
people. The performance of these soon-to-be privileged officials is shocking. Every official covid
intervention was arguably not just a total failure but counter-productive:

           - Lockdowns            - kept people indoors away from sunshine and therefore causing low vitamin D

levels, which correlate with bad covid outcomes. And covid was almost never transmitted
outdoors.

           - Banning early treatment            - cheap and safe alternatives such as vitamin D, antibiotics (to treat
secondary bacterial infections as is standard for respiratory diseases), hydroxychloroquine,
ivermectin and even garlic were denounced or even banned by officials on spurious grounds.
We were not even supposed to find out if these interventions were effective       - it turns out
they all were          - the scientific evidence is overwhelming. Lives were lost.

           - Remdesivir and vents            - medical malpractice on a grand scale that only succeeded in making
the covid death toll higher than otherwise, heightening the covid hysteria

           - Border closures            - the only policy response that succeeded in its own terms. A very high
economic cost considering early treatments were available from mid 2020 and ultimately
futile as the opportunity to prepare for covid it afforded was squandered on useless vaccines.

           - Masks            - no evidence of any benefit whatsoever in preventing spread in anything other than
a surgical setting with open wounds          - the clue is in the name          - “surgical mask”. Rebreathing
your bacteria all day causes respiratory problems. No official is dissuading mask addicts.

           - Covid vaccines and mandates            - have caused approximately 30,000 excess deaths in
Australia from 2021 onward, enormous additional morbidity and disability, and completely
failed to stop the spread of covid as was promised. If this was success, what does failure
look like?

           - Expensive anti-virals            - Extremely expensive anti-virals from Merck and Pfizer had dubious

benefit.

The foregoing amounts to an enormous ongoing compounding malfeasance by public officials
which is killing tens of thousands of Australians and costing billions in public and private money.
However, in its wisdom, the Australian Commonwealth government seeks to censor any ordinary
person not funded by government money from having anything “harmful” to say about it all. It
actually makes perfect sense for the definition of “harmful” to be transformed from “actual provable
harm” to “harms the emotional well-being of the government lackey who is paid to believe this
complete nonsense”. Perhaps if whoever is reading this could please just recognise your cognitive
dissonance over the abject failure of the covid response that you psychologically identify with? And
then move on from that cognitive dissonance by internally acknowledging that in fact, the
“cookers” and “anti-vaxxers” were, at the end of the day, when it came to making life and death
personal and public health decisions, in this case, much cleverer and smarter than you? Rather than
trying to perpetually double-down on failure? Please could you do that?

# The nature of “truth” and “science”

Nietzsche observed that for every person, the notion of what is “true” is really what brings
psychological security. That often means whatever is “true” is that which is tested and reliable. But
not necessarily, absolutely, and for all time, true.

Science is not a set of established facts. Science is a process for testing hypotheses and so iteratively
arriving at a “more true” understanding of reality. The banal catch-cry “trust the science” is
essentially anti-scientific. Really there has been a profound confusion in the West       - the word
“science” now actually refers to the technocratic cult of scientism. Many technological miracles,
such as smart phones, have arisen from scientific and engineering efforts however the existence of
the artefacts such as smart phones doesn't prove anything about the infallibility of technocrats.

Science in fact shifts suddenly on occasion, not just in an incremental manner, when on old
paradigm must be discarded after too many attempted ad-hoc modifications finally make it
untenable. Thomas Kuhn describes this in “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions”. Thus ACMA's
proposed censorship regime makes an implicit the assumption that nothing that has been
scientifically established as true need ever be revised. The fact is, scientific theories have been
discarded many times in the past in ways that the proponents find very embarrassing, if they are still
alive to see the Revolution, which they usually aren't, because as the saying goes “science proceeds
one funeral at a time”

What ACMA is proposing to do with scientific debate on social media would be laughable if it
weren't so obscene. Essentially on matters in which “harm” may arise, such as medical topics,
ACMA is proposing to play scientific whack-a-mole with a large number of dissenters. “The
Science” can change very quickly these days thanks to the internet and it can be very embarrassing
for the still-alive proponents of unsupportable nonsense. We dissenters have the bitter experience of
being censored, shadow-banned and outright banned for applying the findings of recent scientific
papers or basic medical ethics (specifically the Nuremberg code and “first do no harm”). I want to
refer to a particular topic here       - the proposition that not just are the mRNA covid vaccines gene
therapies (there is no doubt they meet the definition of a genetic agent introduced to cause the
making of proteins by the body), but that they can permanently alter cell DNA. This has long been a
subject of “fact checking”. Well, when the facts change, so should the censorship, right? It should
be nimble, agile, and able to respond instantly, correct? In the case of DNA alteration, it emerges
that recent Pfizer covid vaccine batches have been found to contain plasmids containing
contaminant DNA left over from the manufacturing process. So in fact the lipid nanoparticles could
be introducing this DNA into the cell nucleus, causing one of two outcomes      - perpetual spike
protein production by the cell, leading to something like “long covid”, or alternatively, the DNA
inserts randomly and is mutagenic, so probably carcinogenic. Yes, if you got a Pfizer jab you are
probably now a genetically modified organism and it might have given you cancer. So the “facts”
can change in very unexpected ways. So what would be the process for updating ACMA about what
is now “true” so that it isn't censored anymore?

# ACMA's ongoing regulatory burden

In order for the grand misinformation pooh-bahs at ACMA to make correct censorship decisions it
will be necessary for them to take account of all available information on whatever topic could
involve “harm”. So dissenters on social media need to be able to send ACMA correspondence
detailing their argument and citations against the dominant paradigm or narrative.

Personally I may therefore send the ACMA truth-czars information on the following topics:

           - failures of Big Bang cosmology including the invention of dark matter;

           - how electrohydrodynamics is incorrect and impedes progress toward fusion power;

           - the Structured Atom Model;

           - covid vaccine injury and death toll catastrophe;

           - cheap, safe and effective potential treatments for covid, cancer and other ailments;

           - mRNA vaccines in livestock affecting safety of milk and meat;

           - effect of interplanetary electrical currents on climate;

           - World Health Organisation dictatorship via pandemic treaty;

           - Central Bank Digital Currencies;

           - social credit systems;

           - internet censorship regimes;

           - the current monetary system;

           - the Russiagate hoax;

           - Ukraine;

           - Biden family corruption;

           - US electoral fraud;

           - ASIC corruption;

           - AEC anomalies;

           - Epstein Island and the consequent blackmailing of elite figures by intelligence agencies;

           - the mysterious collapse of World Trade Center building 7;

           - the assassination of JFK

To whom at ACMA should I address this ongoing and voluminous correspondence? Can ACMA
read and apply my arguments and citations in a timely manner so that the censorship rules on all
social media platforms are updated as soon as possible after my correspondence?

# The constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication

In the exposure draft ACMA mentions that the censorship regime will not trespass upon our
constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication, as found by the High Court.
The way the censorship regime is constructed any censorship of political communication could be
attributed to the platform itself and blame would not fall on the Parliament, thus sneakily evading
the High Court's ruling. This is quite apart from recent instances of the censorship of actual serving
Australian parliamentarians which is a violation of parliamentary privilege. The recent Robodebt
inquiry should serve to warn public servants that they may not be protected when committing
malfeasance in public office      - maybe some of them belong in jail.

The limits of doctrine of the constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication
are not well defined. The US Supreme Court decisively dealt this potential weakness in their Free
Speech doctrine by recognising the “chilling effect”. In Australia our rights are less clear so to
ensure there is absolutely no doubt that controversial “misinformation” is protected, social media
users may have to resort to a formulation that contrives to bring parliamentary representatives into
the picture:

The statement

“The lipid nanoparticles in the Pfizer covid vaccine cross the blood brain barrier and
transfect brain cells leading to autoimmunity, killing transfected brain cells and potentially
leading to early onset dementia or other brain damage”

should be rewritten as

On platforms that don't censor out of their own sense of misguided obligation, but rather in minimal
adherence to ACMA's diktat, potentially such as X (formerly Twitter), this may be an essential
technique for ensuring protection under the constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political
communication especially when there is no obligation on social media platforms to err on the side
of Free Speech. Every incentive will be for them to over-censor. This is the chilling effect in action.

# Conclusion

Throughout the covid period and since not one person has thanked me for convincing them to avoid
the experimental gene therapies. This is despite me consistently warning people on Facebook and
face-to-face, albeit subject to self-censorship, from before the rollout began in Australia. So despite
my best efforts, from the perspective of the official narrative, my speech has “harmed” no-one.
Australia was coerced and stampeded into a vaccination rate approaching 100% of eligible adults.


-----

The actual demonstrable harm is the self-destruction of the credibility of Australia's political
leadership due to the abject failure of the official covid narrative to deliver on its own promises       -
above all else that the vaccines were “safe and effective”. But rather than confront this failure, the
response of the Australian polity, both government and opposition, is to go after the already
suppressed speech rights of the very people who correctly tried to warn everyone else. It is a
complete outrage.

Furthermore as if to heighten the offensiveness the government's highest priority is to conduct a
referendum for a constitutional amendment for a Voice to Parliament even as it exploits the lack of a
constitutional Free Speech guarantee to further limit the Free Speech of the vast majority of
Australians who aren't professional journalists, academics, public officials or other privileged
persons.

In conclusion, I note that in the Senate, in defence of this appalling bill, Senator Wong said that
democracy requires an “agreement around certain facts”. In the context of a bill that is capable of
suppressing any social media posts deemed “harmful”, I interpret this comment as either a banal
truism, or a call to eliminate all speech that fails to conform with an official set of “facts”. This is
the totalitarian mindset at the centre of Australian political leadership.
