I completely agree that there is false information being spread in this country, both
maliciously and unintentionally. But the answer to misinformation and disinformation is
not to strip them from the internet and regulate media. People need to be able to see,
process, critique and debate. This is how we grow.

Restricting content does not make the Albanese Government look like our protector. It
makes them look like liars; guilty with something to hide.
