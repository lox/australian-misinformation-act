SUBMISSION.

60 pages of rules to shut people up, all for our own good. The target - online misinformation and disinformation, but
how that’s defined casts a wide net. It should apply simply to information that’s not ‘correct’ but we’ve seen how
that works with ‘political correctness’. It doesn’t matter whether it’s false or true, it’s what’s politically acceptable.

It’s no surprise that this originated with the previous government and no surprise either that the present government
is pushing along with it and has ramped it up. Restrictions on individual freedoms generally is a long-term
bi-partisan effort and in all this we’re just following others down the same path, particularly the U.S. where it’s gone
into overdrive.

The problem here is who decides what is ‘correct’. It will be up to a politically driven bureaucracy with
extraordinary powers, backed up by horrendous penalties to decide in a purely arbitrary and subjective manner what
the truth is or isn’t and whether it can be said or not said. It would be enough to claim as a matter of opinion, like the
notorious ‘fact checkers’ do, that a statement is misleading or deceptive and reasonably likely to contribute to
serious harm to label it as misinformation, though it might be quite true. In the U.S. it’s gone even further and
they’ve come up with a new problem - ‘malinformation'. Accurate information that might lead people to come to
the ‘wrong’ conclusions and do the ‘wrong’ things.

When you hear a bureaucrat talking about ‘re-calibrating’ free speech, you might wonder exactly what they have in
mind, but when a political leader tells people openly that “We will continue to be your single source of truth remember that unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth” then it’s pretty clear what’s on. Particularly when
government politicians, mainstream media and educational providers are exempted from this legislation - but
opposition politicians are not. We already have government politicians here routinely calling out any criticism of the
government as misinformation. Incredible when the whole basis of politics is misinformation and disinformation.
Who would trust a politician to tell the truth? Now they want to control the narrative completely.

Singled out particularly as mis/disinformation problems are public health responses, foreign interference in elections
and the undermining of democratic institutions - straight off the U.S. script sheet. What a sick joke is that?

The last three years of the so-called pandemic, the official lies and deception at all levels here and worldwide to
promote it, the brutal response measures and the cancelling of all opposing viewpoints and treatments, will go down
in history as one of the greatest frauds ever perpetuated on humanity. This legislation will certainly assist a future
re-run.

Claims of foreign interference in elections in the U.S. have been revealed as nothing more than politically motivated
home-grown lies to influence those elections.

As for the undermining of democratic institutions, well that’s just what the Twitter files in the U.S. have revealed,
with the government there as the instigator and censorship being conducted on an industrial scale. Just what this
legislation will allow here. Already here during the ‘pandemic’ they set up their secret National Cabinet by-passing
the elected Parliament, where politicians made plans that the people weren’t allowed to know about and they wonder
why people became suspicious. Undemocratic, no transparency and it’s still operating despite promises to shut it
down. Now they want to by-pass Parliament again with the unelected, undemocratic Voice that will be telling the
elected government what to do.

Exemption for the mainstream media? After the 2016 election in the U.S. there were universal calls for people to
only get their news from ‘reliable’ news sources, the mainstream media of course. But people everywhere were
waking up and moving away from the mainstream and turning to online independent sources. The mainstream was
increasingly seen as anything but reliable and in fact had a long history of not reporting the truth and again the U.S.
is a prime example.

It was there way back in 1917 that President Wilson issued Executive Order 2594 creating the Committee on Public
Information at the suggestion of journalist Walter Lippmann to control news during the war. Fellow journalist

Arthur Bullard suggested what the committee should do. Outright censorship was prohibited so he proposed a
different approach - outright lying. “Truth and falsehood are arbitrary terms” he said. “There is nothing in
experience to tell us that one is always preferable to the other. There are lifeless truths and vital lies. The force of an
idea lies in it’s inspirational value. It matters very little if it is true or false”.

Well the war finished but the lying didn’t. More than 70 years later American author Gore Vidal wrote “The
corporate grip on opinion in the United States is one of the wonders of the Western World. No First World country
has ever managed to eliminate so entirely from it”s media all objectivity - much less dissent”.

And it was all happening way before that. In 1880 at a function, New York journalist John Swinton had this to say to
his fellow journalists about the ‘independent press’ - “The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie
outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread.
You know it and I know it and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich
men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities
and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes”.

George Orwell put it more succinctly referring to “the lords of property and their hired liars and bumsuckers".

So much so for the mainstream media that people are expected to get their ‘reliable’ news from. When they tell
people ‘fake news is a threat to our democracy’ you’d have to agree and people are starting to realise where it’s
coming from. And the mainstream is protected by this legislation. ACMA won’t be hounding them for pedalling
misinformation and disinformation. It will be hounding anyone else who calls them out for it.

Enough is enough and people have had enough of the BS and we don’t need to further institutionalise it with this
legislation. Next they’ll be raiding libraries and burning the books.
