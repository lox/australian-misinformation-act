ACMA FREEDOM OF SPEECH SUBMISSION.   5/8/23.

Freedom of speech underpins the whole concept of what it is to live in a democracy; to have equal justice under the
law. It is fundamental in the process of educating our children, our citizenry and Media. Our Media has a responsibility
to do thorough and unbiased investigative journalism. We do not see this any more. This bothers me greatly. Political
discourse is vitriolic and divisive. Who would want any politician to determine what is misinformation? Carefully
crafted lies have lead us into wars as we now know just as one example.
Freedom of speech is fundamental also to scientific process, freedom of religion and basic human rights. Without
freedom of speech we cannot have a healthy, mature, tolerant, discerning population. Honesty is compromised when
one cannot question and openly debate.
I believe that much can be compromised when a Governmental body has the sole authority to determine what is
misinformation and disinformation. History has shown us this. Has it taught us this? It could come at great cost to
learn this lesson all over yet again.
We should not be so eager to censor, defame and criminalise speech. To want to control what people`s speech and
what people think. If we have an educated and a robust population, every persons views can be expressed, explored
proved right or wrong with an eloquent ability to defend positions or admit a need to rethink, re examine based on
evidence, logic for instance.
To implement such legislation I fear, leads to increased surveillance and to a dystopian future.
I say: “NO THANKS!”
I say: “YES” to honesty, respect, tolerance, freedom, liberty, ability to compromise, co operate, demand peace and
fidelity to the truth and the constitution.
