The disinfomafion and misinformafion bill, I believe is one of the greatest threats to democracy. My
quesfion who gets to define what is misinformafion or disinformafion?

In relafion to COVID, it was a rapidly evolving disease and vaccines were trying to catch up.

There are two theories about the origin of COVID, that it was spread by a bat or leaked from the lab.
It is impossible to know the truth without the full cooperafion of the Chinese government.

At the beginning of the pandemic, the COVID lab leak theory was dismissed as a conspiracy theory
and would be regarded as misinformafion/disinformafion and early in 2023, the director of the FBI,
Christopher Wray says that the COVID lab leak theory was likely.

Now back to an Australian polifical issue. The issue of the voice in the consfitufion. We have been
told by the government that the Voice will be an advisory body The Australian Consfitufion was set
up to give a framework on how we are governed as a nafion from the number of representafives to
who can represent us. In my view, the only reason the Voice will go in the consfitufion is for
governance of the nafion. If the Voice, is such a good idea and will improve the lives of the
Indigenous people, why not legislate it. WThe No case by the Yes case that we are racist amongst
many other points. One argument by the Yes campaign is “It has been carefully devised and given the
green light by legal experts.” but the details of the Voice will be designed by the Parliament. If the
government decides that the NO campaign is misinformafion, they have have pulled from the social
media sites.

With mainstream media and the government exempt from this misinformafion, it allows them to
control the narrafive and most people once in power will do anything to keep it. Now if the shoe was
on the other foot and Liberals was in power, they could bring in laws against unions and the Labour
party couldn’t debate it.

Allowing bad ideas to be discussed, helps keep debated open, but censoring informafion will drive
those conspiracy theories further to the ground.

I ask that you drop this bill and protect our democracy, where we are free to debate

Kind regards

Robert McWilliam
