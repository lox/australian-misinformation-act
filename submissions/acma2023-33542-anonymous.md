I have numerous concerns with regard the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and strongly oppose this amendment.

Here are just a few of my concerns for your consideration.

Who decides what “misinformation” is?
What are the criteria used?
Who decides these criteria?

Who decides what correct information is?
What are the criteria used??
Who decides these criteria?

How do you decide what is truthful?
What are the criteria used??
Who decides these criteria?

Why are the government exempt?

Why are main stream media exempt?

What about freedom of speech?

What happens if information that is deemed to be "misinformation" or "disinformation" is later
found to be true?
Is information going to be regularly reviewed to determine whether it is misinformation or
disinformation?
If so, how often would this review occur, and by whom?
What is the process?
Is there going to be one?

Have potential conflicts of interest been addressed?
How can Australians be assured that there are no external influences in determining what is truth?

These past few years in particular have shown the damage that censorship can cause.
Censorship has meant a distinct lack of debate and healthy robust discussion.
It has also become increasingly apparent that with the passing of time, "facts" and "truths" thought
to be accurate have been shown to be far from it.
Decisions made based upon these supposed "facts" can be detrimental to health and wellbeing.
As new information comes to light, or studies are conducted, "facts" and "truths" change.
Misinformation and disinformation are subjective and whilst some may pose a threat to the safety
and wellbeing of Australians, I consider the suppression of accurate information deemed to be
misinformation or disinformation a much bigger threat.
