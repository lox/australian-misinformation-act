Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023. Comments

Why does the Government believe it can appoint an authority to assess the validity of comments of
people yet it will not permit this same authority to assess what the government says? It is these same
people the government is supposed to represent but are demeaned by such legislation. The digital
platform providers will be required to be a fount of knowledge. What constitutes the relevant "online"
sites in this context? What happens if "misinformation" is quoted because it is part of a legitimate
comment of opinion in discussion of a relevant issue?
