Freedom of speech is a core right of every person in a democracy. Restricting freedom of speech has
been done by all despots and dictators throughout history.

Censorship is lazy – censors are too lazy to debate or refute something they disagree with or that
contradicts their established narrative but rather than debate on it’s merits the just remove. This is
incredibly dangerous. The government narrative was 180° wrong in every way during the covid
episode with the facts now established showing everything they did was completely wrong and
unscientific. Anyone disagreeing on social media was censored. This cost countless lives.

Australia’s obligations with respect to freedom of speech and freedom of expression

Australia is a party to the seven core international human rights treaties.

Mostly relevantly, this includes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

Article 19 of the ICCPR Freedom of Expression

The natural and most obvious Article to focus on from within those agreements is Article 19 of

the ICCPR, extracted as follows:

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall

include

freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of

frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other

media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in

paragraph 2 of this article carries with it

special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but

these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b)For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of

public health or morals.

I have no confidence in the governments ability to provide any accurate information about anything.
