Good morning

I am writing to protest the Australian Government new proposed laws in relation to online
misinformation and disinformation.

As has become very clear there are many pieces of disinformation and misinformation fed to us by
the Australian Government and the people we pay to serve our country. We have had enough lies
and interference in our lives this last 3 years in particular, resulting in injury and death.

I do not under any circumstances give permission for you to impinge on our freedom any longer!

I have no faith in your judgement on this matter

Sincerely


-----
