Twenty years ago, I paid a substantial sum of good money and a heavy personal price to move my family from a Socialist
country that silenced our voices using various means of draconian laws created by that government, election interference. police
​brutality and shutting down group meetings, this piece of authoritarian legislation is horrifying to me and my family.

We object to having our voices silenced on social media, particularly if we disagree with any federal, state or council bureaucrats.
Who gets to choose what is “true” and what’s not? I may disagree completely with that person and should have the right to
state it and argue my case respectfully.

Freedom of Speech is the cornerstone of our democracy and I’m very dismayed that this bill has even being drawn up in draft
form! It is un-Australian and completely anti democratic and will destroy our rights and freedoms.

**We did not vote for this and it was not taken to the election by this government who is only in power with 33% of the**
**vote. I sincerely hope this legislation is scrapped before it goes further.**

This kind of law leads to totalitarian governance like China has.

PS How is it that the focus is not on removing the trash and sludge that undermines our culture like pornography, violence,
prostitution, child grooming and black arts like devil worshipping.  I would happily support a bill that does this.

Yours sincerely,
