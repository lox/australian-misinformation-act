While there are many conspiracy theories floating around on social media platforms I believe
that the right to FREE SPEECH outweighs the so called risks this Bill will try to combat.

When seeing these conspiracy theories on social media if it seems too far out there i just
“hide” the post & don’t read it.

The thing is, some of these theories are now being proven correct, so if they were taken down
before people had a chance to read them, then there would not be a democratic voice to be
able to question these theories. Only the underground network of conspiracy theorists and the
subject of the theory would know about it – so no Public Scrutiny.

As I mentioned some of these theories are being proven correct ie;

Our Federal Government urged all Australians to do the right thing and get the first &
subsequent covid vaccines to protect themselves, their families & their communities, where it
has now been proven this was a blatant lie by our Governments as the covid vaccines were
never tested against transmission of the disease.

Our Federal Government also stated that these vaccines were not mandatory, but there was
“no choice” and no informed consent for most working people because if they did not comply
they lost their jobs, another blatant lie by our Governments. Many thousands of people lost
their jobs because they either did not want or could not on medical grounds be injected with
these unproven vaccines and there are many who still to this day have not been re-instated.

Our Federal Government & Health Departments also stated that these covid vaccines were
safe & effective, but we now learn that they were neither safe nor effective, more blatant lies
and in the process the fundamentals of the Doctor-Patient Relationship have been destroyed
because the Hippocratic Oath namely "I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and
**harm" is in tatters due to our Health bureaucrats meddling, for some people this relationship**
can now never be repaired.

There are many thousands of vaccine recipients struggling every day with health conditions
that they never had before, the likes of myocarditis & pericarditis and blood clotting issues as
well as very young infants struggling with infections of all kinds one after the other because
their immune systems have been damaged.

The lockdowns forcing people to stay home and not go to work and not visit their families
were totally authoritarian and totally unnecessary because for most healthy people of all ages
this covid virus was no worse than any other flu, what made it worse was the effects of the
covid vaccines on the recipients immune systems which left them with lower resources to
fight the covid infection, ie people who had the vaccines got sicker than the ones who didn’t.

These and many other issues have been brought to public attention via social media platforms
before they were proven correct, if this new Bill were in force at the time, none of this would
have seen the light of day.

Australian people’s trust of their Governments & Health Authorities is at an all-time low,
instead of trying to conceal more from Public scrutiny our Governments need to win back
trust by being more open and transparent and put the interest of the people who voted them
into Office ahead of profits for large corporations.
