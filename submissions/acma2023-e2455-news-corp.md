# SUBMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORT, REGIONAL
 DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS CONSULTATION
 COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING MISINFORMATION AND
 DISINFORMATION) BILL 2023

 20 AUGUST 2023

News Corp Australia appreciates the opportunity to provide this submission to the Department of
Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communica?ons and The Arts regarding the
Exposure DraB Communica)ons Legisla)on Amendment (Comba5ng Misinforma)on and
_Disinforma)on) Bill 2023 (the dra) Bill)._

We note that news media is not intended to be captured by the draB Bill. Further to that, it is well
understood that news media organisa?ons publish content on various plaGorms, and publish content
they source from many places, not just content they produce, and that those organisa?ons are
responsible for all that they publish, regardless of the plaGorm, or source, by a range and
combina?on of laws, regula?ons, self-regula?on and editorial standards. We note this includes thirdparty comments on news media organisa?ons’ websites. The Department is also aware that
publishers are also liable in defama?on for third-party comments on their social media pages.
Adver?sing is subject to an exis?ng scheme, whereby the adver?ser is liable for the content of the
ad, regardless of whether the material requires an authorisa?on or not.

Given the above, all news media organisa?on services should be excluded services. Therefore, all
content news media organisa?ons publish should be professional news content; and all that content
should be excluded when republished (on other plaGorms).

The current draBing catches news media organisa?ons for all content they publish if they did not
produce it, and as a result imposes an unnecessary and heavy burden on organisa?ons that are
already responsible for all that they publish.

We recommend the following amendments to the draB Bill to ensure news media organisa?ons are
appropriately excluded for all services and all content on all plaGorms.
