Submission in opposition to the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

You misguided fools! 1984 by George Orwell was supposed to be a warning,
not an instruction manual.

Don’t you realize who the main character in that story is?

Winston Smith is YOU:

A mid-level functionary (just like you) in a government organization (just
like the one this bill supports).

And what happens to him? The very man who seems to hold out the
promise of help (O’Brien), ends up being his tormentor, destroying his life.
The system requires it.

Such a system as the one you are building now.

You may think you’re doing the right thing now, but history tells the truth.
Just like the Praetorian Guard or the NKVD, eventually you’ll be too old or
you’ll know too much and they will turn on you, mercilessly.

Some younger, more cunning upstart will seek your job and use these tools
against you and there will be no appeal, nothing but a brief moment of selfreflection where you remember that people tried to warn you.

You may think life will be better for you in a totalitarian society but I can
assure you that if you examine any of the growing number of such States
around the world, your class is not the protected ones. You might hope to
join those ranks, by proving loyal service and getting this bill passed but I
can guarantee you, it’s a club and we aren’t in it. You have to be born into
that club and the fact that you aren’t on the inside yet proves you will never
be. Best to get out now and save what’s left of your integrity, wealth and
family dignity.

As for me? What do I matter? I’m a prole and I know it. My life ended long
ago, and I’m on borrowed time, enjoying every day as it comes. We are not
the same - I’m not opposed to this bill for my sake alone, but also for yours.
Unlike what you’re trying to do here, I’m not trying to rob you, I’m trying
to help you. Help you understand that the people pushing for more control
have no interest in protecting you, no matter what they say. You’ll be
crushed by elite parasites abusing this legislation, just the same as they
use legislation to abuse the working classes you despise. It’s only a matter
of time.

Perhaps that’s karma. You’ll be hung on the gallows you helped construct –
metaphorically speaking.

I was born in Australia, have paid taxes all my life and volunteer in my
community – even putting myself in harm’s way. This bill is opposed to
every value I was raised to cherish – freedom of speech, personal
responsibility, community governance and social justice. At no time in our


-----

nation’s history has a faceless bureaucrat known better than me how to live
my life, or what’s best for me to read, to discuss or to argue against. You’re
not my nanny. It’s not your job to decide what I can and cannot think, say
or believe.

Stop this bill. Stop this ever-increasing slide into bumbling, incoherent,
micromanaged totalitarian fascism because history shows where it ends,
every time. No matter what your smug overlords say, nothing can change
human nature. Every stupid idea has already been tried and proven to fail,
yet here we are again, proving from history that nobody learns from history.

You’re not smarter than the people who preceded you. You won’t be getting
the armed security and the QRF when the riots begin in your city – that’s
reserved the Club Members Only. No, sorry; when the time comes, you’ll
be on your own with the rest of us, dealing with the consequences of your
actions today. Today is when you can make a difference, to help stop
building the machine of your own destruction. All it takes is to look into the
future, at how this legislation can be used against you.

Even if you’re not engaging in WrongThink right now, look at how many
people are having past actions judged against modern standards. Now
project how those modern ‘standards’ may become more extreme, more
stringent, more puritanical in the future. Are you certain there’s NOTHING
in your past that won’t come back to haunt you? Some comment or email,
a joke caught on video, that was perfectly fine at the time, but now that
we’re in a different world, could be taken out of context and used to destroy
you and everything you’ve worked for?

Stop this bill. Just delete the drafts, use a new document to write your
resignation letter and semi retire to a rural town to start growing food – we
all know that’s the end result of this global, government push for more
control – total control of the food supply and they’ve got us by the balls.

Who feeds you, owns you.
