To whom it may concern,

We are writing to make a submission to the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
_Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. The Australian Citizens Party_
(ACP) adamantly opposes this law, which is a dangerous vehicle of censorship and discrimination.

The ACP, as a firm proponent of Australia’s economic and political sovereignty, a staunch anti-war
advocate, and critic of political corruption, consistently publishes content which is opposed to
mainstream media narratives and the views of the government of the day. The ACP has already been
targeted for censorship if the proposed laws are introduced, which we have detailed in our submission.

Please find attached our submission, including two case studies which illustrate our concerns over the
proposed law, and additional research in support of our views.

Yours sincerely,

Melissa Harrison Robert Barwick

### 1. ACMA Bill will have Orwellian consequences 
The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
_Disinformation) Bill 2023 provides the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), “with_
new powers to combat online misinformation and disinformation”. The Australian Citizens Party (ACP)
believes that this law is another dangerous lurch down the path to totalitarianism which all Australians
should oppose. The Bill gives the government power to regulate “truth” online by being able to force
social media platforms to censor “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is “harmful”— three vague
terms that are open to very broad interpretation.[1]

On the 120th birthday of George Orwell, author of the book Nineteen Eighty-four, in which a totalitarian
government regulated the truth, the Australian Government announced that it would introduce
legislation which heads down that path, here in Australia. The Bill excludes content which is authorised
by either federal, state or local governments from being deemed “misinformation”. In other words,
anything authorised by Government cannot be held to be misleading. One only has to consider the
Government position on the Iraq invasion, or during the COVID period or the background behind what is
presently occurring in Ukraine—the government position cannot be classed as “misleading”, unlike any
position which opposes that Government line.

If ACMA determines some content to be “misinformation” or “disinformation” it can at its option issue
potentially huge penalties, which would quickly cause most companies or individuals to comply and
exclude or remove the complained-of content or go out of business. There is no limitation in the Bill of
what “standards” might be imposed by ACMA if it decided to issue a standard applying to particular
social media providers rather than endorse a voluntary code.

It is difficult to see how this legislation in its present form could be simply amended to make it workable
without incorporating unacceptable risks of the Nineteen Eighty-four-type consequences. It should not
be administered by an unaccountable body but administration by the current political class would be of
comparable concern. If there is to be any limitation on content, it should be clearly and unambiguously
defined. There are many obvious examples, we can all think of things that should not be broadcast, but
it is difficult to define them in some general way. There should not be any definition which incorporates
an ability to determine what is “truth”.

The fact that the bill explicitly exempts any government communication, of any level of government,
from being considered misinformation or disinformation, shows how Orwellian this law will be. While
the bill’s penalties won’t apply to individuals, it will enforce a regime of suppression of any speech on
social media that undermines government claims. It would not just apply to protecting public health, as
we have already witnessed in the mass-censorship of contrary analysis relating to COVID-19, including of
qualified doctors and scientists. It would also apply to debates on foreign policy, such as whether Russia
or China are “threats” to Australia, which the government claims to justify committing almost $1 billion
to arming NATO’s proxy Ukraine against Russia, or promising $368 billion to buy US and British
submarines to deploy against China.

### 2. ACMA’s judgement already dubious
The government has described the new proposed powers for ACMA as being “consistent with the key
recommendations in the ACMA’s June 2021 Report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms’
disinformation and news quality measures”. However, ACMA’s report itself contained examples of the
regulator’s dubious judgement in determining what is misinformation. This raises serious questions over
the wisdom of allowing ACMA, or any such organisation, to be an arbiter of truth.

For example, ACMA’s June 2021 report included a lengthy case study on “false, misleading or unproven
narratives arising from the COVID-19 pandemic”, which aimed to provide insights into “the range,
spread and impact of disinformation and misinformation in Australia, providing a baseline to inform
future thinking and developments across government and industry.”

ACMA examined what it determined were four “distinct online misinformation narratives”, which were
“anti-vaccine, anti-5G, anti-lockdown and QAnon”. If at this time of this report, ACMA had possessed
powers proposed in this Bill, online discourse concerning these so-called “misinformation narratives”
could be censored at ACMA’s direction. However, there are serious questions over ACMA’s judgement.
For example, “anti-lockdown” views, which ACMA determined were “misinformation”, would certainly
have been expressed by some of the 3,000 public housing residents of North Melbourne who were
abruptly forced into a hard lockdown and banned from leaving their homes in early July 2020.[2] Many of
the vulnerable residents reported that they did not receive adequate food supplies—would their pleas
for help or complaints over their treatment be considered “anti-lockdown” “misinformation” by ACMA?

Similarly, ACMA deemed “anti-vaccination” views as “misinformation narratives”. However, around six
months after ACMA’s June 2021 report was published, the Australian government established a Covid19 vaccine injury claims scheme, to which thousands of Australians have submitted claims.[3] In the two
years since ACMA’s June 2021 report, there have been numerous mainstream media reports of serious
injuries sufferers have attributed to Covid-19 vaccines. Prior to its official acknowledgement by the
government and mainstream media, any social media discussion of vaccine injuries was likely judged
“anti-vaccination” “misinformation” by ACMA. If ACMA had possessed the proposed powers at this
time, social media discourse on vaccine injuries would have likely been censored at ACMA’s direction.
ACMA’s researchers conducted a “representative survey” of 2,659 Australians, dividing them into either
“informed” or “misinformed” based on whether they “agreed with official advice at the time” regarding
“COVID-19 guidelines, prevention strategies and treatments”. Any Australian who suffered an injury
they attributed to a Covid-19 vaccine, prior to the government’s “official” acknowledgement of the
issue, would likely have been deemed “misinformed” by ACMA.

These two examples demonstrate that ACMA’s judgement of what is misinformation, and what is not, is
fallible. ACMA’s own report admitted: “Given the constantly shifting nature of misinformation,
_difficulties in assessing falsehoods, and the challenges in accessing relevant data, it is not possible to_
quantify the true scale and volume of misinformation in Australia.” (Emphasis added) Despite this
admission, the government is proposing to make ACMA the arbiter of online truth.

### 3. Government and mainstream media cannot be deemed “misinformation”

The proposed Bill claims to balance freedom of expression with the need to address online harm, by
outlining a number of exceptions, which includes “professional news content and authorised electoral
content” and “content authorised by the Commonwealth, State or Territory governments”. This means
that content produced by mainstream media or authorised by the government cannot be considered
misinformation.

An examination of mainstream media allegations and claims from government representatives over the
last several decades proves that both entities are fully capable of lying to the public, or providing false
information, which has led to Australia’s shameful involvement in several wars.

#### 3.1 First Gulf War
[The 11 October 1990 LA Times headline blared: “Witnesses Tell of Iraqi Atrocities in Kuwait: Congress:](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-10-11-mn-2801-story.html)
Members are shaken by what they hear. Kuwait’s ambassador warns that ‘time is running out.’” It
reported testimony given to the US Congress by a 15-year-old eyewitness that “Iraqi soldiers with guns”
[had removed Kuwaiti “babies from the incubators … leaving the babies to die on the cold floor”. It was](https://youtu.be/WkRylMGLPMU?t=87)
[entirely made up—the 15-year-old “witness” hadn’t even been in Kuwait; she was the daughter of](https://youtu.be/WkRylMGLPMU?t=87)
Kuwait’s ambassador to Washington.

#### 3.2 Iraq invasion
As is now proven, the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw lie after lie repeated in media headlines.

2001 New York Times: “Iraqi Tells of Renovations at Sites For Chemical and Nuclear Arms”;
2002 CNN: “Experts: Iraq has tons of chemical weapons”;
2002 The Star: “Mad Saddam ready to attack: 45 minutes from a chemical war”;
2002 The Sun: “Brits 45 mins from doom”;
2002 New York Times: “US Scoffs at Iraq Claim of No Weapons of Mass Destruction”;
2003 Baltimore Sun: “CIA said Iraq had nuclear program”.

Worldwide, thousands of media headlines faithfully repeated the same lies. The British and American
liars got the war, destroyed the country and the region—and got away with it.

Australian politicians and government representatives also made false claims which facilitated
Australia’s participation in the illegal invasion of Iraq. On 20 March 2003 then-Prime Minister John
Howard gave a televised address to the nation announcing his decision to commit Australian troops to
the invasion of Iraq. The reasons Howard gave in that speech for supporting the war proved to be lies,
including the main pretext of weapons of mass destruction, which Iraq didn’t have (as proved later but
which weapons inspectors had already insisted). He also made this claim: “This week the Times of
London detailed the use of a human shredding machine as a vehicle for putting to death critics of
Saddam Hussein. This is the man, this is the apparatus of terror we are dealing with”, he said. “The
removal of Saddam Hussein will lift this immense burden of terror from the Iraqi people.” We now
know—after launching a war that would kill a million Iraqis and set in train the events that unleashed
[the ISIS terror monsters on Iraq and Syria—the human shredding machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080905184134/http:/www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3284-614607,00.html) didn’t exist either.

[Former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, 15 October 2002: "Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of](https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-weapon-of-mass-distraction-20080605-gdsgkc.html)
mass destruction … That is a matter of empirical fact.”

[Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, 4 February 2003: “The Australian government knows that](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber/hansardr/2003-02-04/0015;query=Id:%22chamber/hansardr/2003-02-04/0000%22)
Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons. … The
intelligence material collected over recent times, to which Australia has contributed, points
overwhelmingly to Saddam Hussein having acted in systematic defiance of the resolutions of the
Security Council, maintained his stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and sought to reconstitute
a nuclear weapons program.”

[Former Liberal MP Alexander Downer, 18 March 2003: “Iraq's weapons pose a grave threat to](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2003-03-18%2F0010;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F2003-03-18%2F0000%22)
international peace and security and to Australia's national interests. … the world faces a threat which is
terrible to contemplate: weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a ruthless dictator … Locating,
securing and disposing of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities must and will be a major
objective for the coalition. We must achieve the disarmament of Iraq.”

[In 2003, Australian Ambassador Richard Butler, former head of the UN Special Commission to disarm](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/the-prince-who-was-a-citys-finest-servant-20041010-gdjw3d.html)
Iraq from 1997 to 1999: “Iraq certainly did have weapons of mass destruction. Trust me. I held some in
my own hands.”

#### 3.3 Libya ‘intervention’
The world witnessed a repeat in Libya in 2011, when Qaddafi was accused of mass-rape and planning
genocide against the rebels based in Benghazi:

The Guardian: “Gaddafi ‘supplies troops with Viagra to encourage mass rape’, claims diplomat”;
Washington Times: “Rebels say Gadhafi uses rape as fear tactic in war”;
CNN: “Libyan rebels say captured cell phone videos show rape, torture”.

[In 2016, the UK House of Commons Libya Report acknowledged the 2011 intervention by the USA, UK,](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/834/834.pdf)
and France to “protect” Libyan civilians from “genocide”—which had resulted in the brutal murder of
Qaddafi and the collapse of Libya into a failed state and haven for slave-traders and terrorists—had
been a mistake: “This policy was not informed by accurate intelligence”, it stated. “In particular, the
Government failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a
significant Islamist element. … The result was … widespread human rights violations … and the growth of
ISIL in North Africa.” (Emphasis added.)

#### 3.4 China
Today, the Australian Citizens Party is gravely concerned that Australia’s mainstream media and certain
politicians have promoted similarly false narratives against the Chinese government, to drive Australia
toward an insane war with our largest trading partner, China. Our AUKUS partners, the US and UK
governments, have openly declared China a geopolitical adversary.

The ACP has expended considerable effort towards investigating, and ultimately discrediting, many of
the allegations against the Chinese government which have been levelled by mainstream media and
politicians seemingly bent on war. The ACP’s research openly contradicts many mainstream media
narratives and statements made by anti-China politicians—if ACMA’s proposed powers are legislated,
would ACMA determine the ACP’s research “misinformation”, thereby resulting in the censorship of the
ACP’s anti-war views from social media?

### 4. Social media censorship long-desired by intelligence agencies
When the government justified the proposed Bill, it emphasised the misinformation and disinformation
that circulated the internet during COVID, citing as its example the claim early in 2020 that 5G radiation
caused COVID, which led to 5G towers in Australia and around the world being vandalised. The truth,
however, is that the Australian government and its closest geopolitical “partners” in the so-called Five
Eyes countries— the USA, UK, Canada, and New Zealand—have been pushing for social media
censorship powers since at least 2018.

As the ACP revealed in a 28 May 2019 release, “‘Christchurch Call’ establishes dangerous pretext for
state censorship”, the global agenda for a “techno-Stasi police state” has been set by the Five Eyes
intelligence-sharing (a.k.a. surveillance) alliance. The ACP highlighted how an “August 2018 Five Eyes
Ministerial gathering on Queensland’s Gold Coast took aim at ‘faster identification and removal of illicit
content’, and limiting ‘coercive acts of interference and disinformation’.” On 15 May 2019 New Zealand
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emanuel Macron launched their “Christchurch Call”
for internet censorship, in response to the Christchurch massacre; previously reluctant, the world’s
biggest social media platforms all signed on. In the COVID years, those social media companies entered
into informal arrangements with government agencies to aggressively police content on their platforms;
with this bill, the Albanese government is trying to make those arrangements formal, and permanent. As
the ACP questioned in its 2019 release: “Identifying and removing illicit content featuring acts of
terrorism, child sexual abuse and extremist violence is one thing, but who decides what constitutes
‘disinformation’?” That is the age-old question.

The Australian Citizens Party has documented that social media companies are working in collaboration
with intelligence-connected organisations to conduct mass censorship of alternative voices, under the
guise of combating foreign interference and misinformation.[4] Numerous independent media
publications have exposed social media companies’ propensity to act as a censorship arm of the US
government. Documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former contractor to the US
National Security Agency (NSA), revealed that Five Eyes intelligence agencies worked with Big Tech to
conduct mass internet surveillance.

### 5. Case study: ACP targeted for censorship
It is evident that the proposed Bill goes much further than stopping vandalism of 5G towers, or livestreaming atrocities, into areas open to political debate, including the public health response to COVID19, supposed foreign interference in elections, and “undermining” democracy.

The government’s fact sheet accompanying the exposure draft of the Bill states: “Misinformation and
disinformation spread via digital platform services is a major issue worldwide. The rapid spread of false,
misleading and deceptive information online has resulted in a multitude of harms from disrupted public
health responses to foreign interference in elections and the undermining of democratic institutions.”
(Emphasis added)

Allegations of “cyber-enabled foreign interference” and “state-linked information operations” (i.e.
misinformation) have already been used by the private sector to censor social media. ACP has identified
a global censorship network, involving Big Tech, intelligence-connected organisations, and Western

4 See attached, ‘ASPI central in global censorship network’

think tanks, which uses accusations of state-backed inauthentic activity to silence undesirable views. As
reported by The Grayzone on 2 November 2021, one week before the November 2021 Nicaraguan
elections, social media giants Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (Google), and Instagram launched a massive
censorship sweep of social media accounts, including media outlets, journalists and activists, which
supported the left-wing Sandinista government. Facebook refused to distinguish between real people
and alleged spam accounts, justifying mass account deletions by claiming that all were state-backed
bots. Nicaragua has previously been subject to US government attempts to destabilise the country,
which included a 2018 US-backed coup which attempted the violent overthrow of the Sandinista
government.

If ACMA’s proposed powers were in place in 2002, when the US, UK and Australian governments lied
about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, they could have been used to suppress public
opposition to invasion and war. Will the ACP be de-platformed for saying the government is lying about
the “threat” of Russia and China? The ACP has already been targeted for censorship under the proposed
Bill, by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), an organisation which is funded by the Australian
government, and is a major proponent of the alleged “threat” China and Russia pose to Australia.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute presents itself as an “independent, non-partisan” policy think
tank, despite evidence of its overwhelming bias towards the geopolitical interests of the United States
and other Five Eyes nations. ASPI has been the primary agitator against the Chinese government, and is
leading the insane drive to war with China. ASPI’s funding sources, however, prove that its so-called
“independence” is a farce. The majority of ASPI’s funding comes from the Australian federal
government, but ASPI also receives fund from foreign governments, primarily the US government; the
private sector; and the arms industry. ASPI has received significant funding from social media giants
Google, Facebook, and Twitter. A 1 April 2021 article by Marcus Rubenstein for APAC News documented
that, since its founding in 2001, ASPI’s defence industry sponsors have raked in over $51 billion in
Australian government contracts.

ASPI has produced volumes of reports which accuse the Chinese government of interfering in Australian
politics and civil society. These reports are often funded by the US government, which has deemed
China a strategic adversary. For several years, ASPI has repeatedly accused the Chinese government of
conducting foreign interference operations against Australia. However, ASPI’s dubious “research” has
been consistently discredited by the Australian Citizens Party and other researchers.[5] The ACP has
repeatedly called out ASPI’s appallingly low evidentiary standards and poor quality research, including
[asserting that](https://citizensparty.org.au/aspi-forced-labour-hypocrites-and-academic-fraudsters) in ASPI’s anti-China reports, “relevant information is ignored, and sources are interpreted
in extreme bad faith, or are misrepresented in a manner so misleading it can only be described as
academic fraud.” It is evident that the ASPI, which former Prime Minister Paul Keating has described as
“a US cell” in its promotion of war with China, functions as a vehicle by which the US government can
pursue its geopolitical objectives against China.

#### 5.1 Cyber-enabled foreign interference allegations
The latest iteration of ASPI’s Chinese influence hysteria is “cyber-enabled foreign interference”, or
“state-backed information operations”, which are ostensibly conducted through social media platforms.
ASPI alleges that foreign governments—invariably those targeted by Anglo-American strategic

5 See attached, “ASPI’s ‘cyber-interference’ allegations: more junk research”

-----

agendas—have used social media to interfere in (primarily Western) elections. ASPI’s allegations are
overwhelmingly sourced to Western mainstream media publications and think tanks, and intelligenceconnected organisations. To make these sensational claims, ASPI has relied on hearsay and has
demonstrated very poor evidentiary standards. ASPI typically hedges its allegations with qualifiers such
as “potentially”, “might have”, “possibly”, “suggests”. In one example, ASPI claimed that an example of
election interference included mainstream media claims that in 2017, persecuted Australian journalist
and founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, had acted as the “principal international agitator” in the lead
up to the Catalan independence referendum, because Assange criticised the Spanish government on
Twitter. ASPI wrote that Assange was allegedly “promoted and amplified by Russian state-sponsored
media outlets and Twitter bots”.

ASPI admits that it makes “inferences” to determine who is behind various social media “bots”—
automated software which engages on social media, usually using fake accounts which mimic real
people—which ASPI typically attributes to the Chinese government. ASPI claims that these “cyberenabled foreign interference” operations seek to influence elections, “manipulate the information
environment” (i.e. “misinformation”) and “diminish public trust in democratic processes” (i.e.
“undermine democratic institutions”), activities which, under the proposed law, would come under
ACMA’s purview.

ASPI is funded by social media companies and has been appointed one of a few select “research
partners” which help social media giants decide whether bot accounts are “state-backed information
operations”. ASPI works closely with Twitter to provide analysis to support Twitter’s mass purges of
accounts deemed to be Chinese state-backed information operations, and has received funding from
[Twitter for this work. However, ASPI has admitted that it did not have access to Twitter’s relevant data](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall)
to independently verify whether accounts were actually linked to the Chinese government. Facebook’s
parent company, Meta, is also a major sponsor of ASPI and works with the think tank to analyse alleged
state-backed information operations.

ASPI is not a disinterested or neutral party—it is funded by social media companies, weapons
manufacturers, and the US government. ASPI’s “research” on alleged Chinese state-backed social media
information operations relies on analysis conducted by intelligence-connected organisations, which
invariably attributes foreign influence “bots” to adversaries of the US government.[6]

#### 5.2 ASPI targets the Australian Citizens Party
In a 24 July 2023 article titled “China’s cyber interference narrows in on Australian politics and policy”,
ASPI analysts alleged that Chinese state-backed social media “bots” were interfering in Australia’s
domestic and foreign policies. ASPI claimed these bots criticised Australian spy agencies, AUKUS, the USAustralian alliance, and ASPI itself; and promoted the views of “certain individuals”, naming former
Prime Minister Paul Keating and the Australian Citizens Party (ACP), who are outspoken critics of ASPI’s
warmongering against China.

According to ASPI, this Chinese government misinformation operation included “amplifying division”
over the Aboriginal “voice” debate, and “sustained targeting” of “the big four banks”. “Major Australian
banks are a key focus for many accounts in the campaign, including the Commonwealth Bank, the
National Australia Bank, ANZ and Westpac”, ASPI asserted. “This includes claims that Australian banks

aren’t serving regional Australia and First Nations customers. Concurrently, the campaign promotes the
views of certain individuals (such as former prime minister Paul Keating) and organisations (especially
_the Australian Citizens Party).” (Emphasis added.) This followed similar allegations of November 2022,_
when ASPI announced that an alleged Chinese state-backed bot network was engaging in “more direct
interference in Australia politics” and “seeking to engage in political interference” by “seeking to drive
online attention” toward the social media accounts of the ACP and its members. ASPI’s “analysis” came
dangerously close to suggesting that those with views critical of AUKUS, intelligence agencies, and the
US government, are part of a Chinese government foreign influence operation.

ASPI called for this alleged Chinese state-backed activity to be included in the government’s bill to
censor social media: “If the new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation, or a
variation of the bill, are passed, then as a first step ACMA should mandate that digital platforms,
including social media platforms, disclose all state-backed influence operations publicly …”

ASPI’s allegations that the Australian Citizens Party’s social media accounts are being amplified by an
alleged Chinese-state backed information are alarming. ASPI exerts powerful influence on Australian
government policy-making, and already functions as a key player in a global censorship network which
conducts mass censorship of social media accounts which ASPI deems are “state-backed information
operations”. ACMA’s June 2021 report, which informed the proposed Bill, proposed that the
government make ASPI’s censorship activities official. Recommendation 5 of the ACMA report states
that “the government should consider establishing a Misinformation and Disinformation Action Group
to support collaboration and information-sharing between digital platforms, government agencies,
researchers and NGOs on issues relating to disinformation and misinformation”. If the government
implements ACMA’s recommendation, ASPI will likely play a central role in deciding whether the social
media activities of those opposing the interests of ASPI’s funders (which include major arms
manufacturers and the US government), such as the Citizens Party, are part of alleged Chinese
government “misinformation” campaigns, thereby facilitating the censorship of alternate views and
silencing genuine political discourse.

### 6. Case study: Foreign influence peddlers a conduit of US government foreign influence?
Allegations that social media platforms have facilitated misinformation or foreign interference can be
used to attack specific companies, to the benefit of their corporate competitors or the strategic interests
of Western governments. Often, conflicts of interests are not disclosed by those making such
allegations.

In December 2019, the Morrison government “requested that major digital platforms in Australia
develop a voluntary code of practice to address online disinformation and news quality concerns”.
ACMA was tasked with overseeing the development of the code and reporting on the “adequacy of
digital platforms’ disinformation and news quality measures”. ACMA’s resulting June 2021 report
informed the government’s proposed disinformation laws and new powers for ACMA.

A month prior to the Morrison government’s request, Labor politicians launched a corresponding arm of
potential censorship, via theI“Foreign interference through Social Media” inquiry. After the lapse of the
previous parliament, the inquiry was re-launched by Liberal Senator James Paterson in November 2022.

-----

From inception, ASPI’s influence over both iterations of the inquiry was evident. ASPI’s testimony,
submission and research were frequently referenced by both iterations of the inquiry, and the hearings
were stacked with ASPI associates. For example, in addition to current and former ASPI staffers,
witnesses to the inquiry included:

  - The Alliance for Securing Democracy, which operates under the German Marshall Fund, an ASPI
corporate sponsor.

  - Badiucao, an artist who produces the artwork for many of ASPI’s reports which attack China.

  - Google, Twitter, and Facebook, which are all funders of ASPI.

  - CyberCX, one of ASPI’s corporate sponsors.

  - The Stanford Internet Observatory, a speaker at ASPI’s 2023 Sydney Dialogue, which participates
with ASPI in working with social media companies to censor alleged “state-backed” accounts.

When Liberal Senator James Paterson resurrected the inquiry, which he then chaired, it was evident that
Paterson’s aim was to use it as a vehicle to attack the Chinese government and to pursue Paterson’s
personal vendetta against social media platform, TikTok. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is
Chinese-owned. Numerous witnesses who were invited to testify before the inquiry had previously
published reports attacking TikTok, such as Internet 2.0, an organisation which counts numerous former
US government officials as part of its leadership team.

Although the final report and hearings of the inquiry were replete with claims of alleged Chinese and
Russian government foreign interference, it appears that the inquiry itself was a conduit of American
government interference.

For example, Paterson re-launched the “Foreign Interference through Social Media” inquiry shortly after
his return from Washington DC, where he attended a September 2022 conference of UK-based
organisation, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), of which Paterson is a co-chair.
[Paterson’s trip was funded by IPAC. IPAC’s Members are composed of international parliamentarians,](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Senators_Interests/Senators_Interests_Register/144138)
including Australian politicians, whose primary objective is to agitate in their respective countries
against the Chinese government. IPAC has initiated an international “series of coordinated legislative
actions” and “parliamentary interventions” to ensure that IPAC-favoured (and usually anti-China)
legislation is introduced; and, after intense media campaigns and lobbying by IPAC Members, is often
passed.

French and British parliamentary members of IPAC have led attacks against TikTok in their respective
countries, successfully lobbying their governments to have the company banned from government
devices. IPAC co-chair Senator James Paterson led the charge for TikTok to be banned from government
devices in Australia. IPAC members served as witnesses to the hearings of the Australian Foreign
Interference through Social Media inquiry. IPAC is funded by the National Endowment for Democracy
(NED), the notorious US government-funded regime-change proponent (one of the NED’s co-founders
[admitted that much of the agency’s activities were formerly conducted covertly by the CIA). The US has](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/09/22/innocence-abroad-the-new-world-of-spyless-coups/92bb989a-de6e-4bb8-99b9-462c76b59a16/)
been at the forefront of campaigning against TikTok, including funding ASPI’s 2020 report which claimed
that TikTok was “curating and controlling global information flows”, under direction of the Chinese
government.

[In a 20 April 2023 interview with the ABC, Paterson was asked about members of the US Federal](https://www.senatorpaterson.com.au/news/first-public-hearing-of-the-committee-on-foreign-interference-through-social-media-abc)
Communications Commission who had been very outspoken in demanding a total ban on TikTok.
Paterson replied that he “was in the United States personally only a few weeks ago to discuss this with
legislators and members of the administration”. Paterson’s March-April trip to Washington DC to

considering a total ban of TikTok and forcing TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to divest TikTok to a
non-Chinese owner. The final report of Paterson’s inquiry recommends that, if the US government does
undertake these actions, Australia should follow suit. Commissioner Brendan Carr of the US Federal
Communications Commission, whom Paterson described as “one of the earliest and leading voices in
calling out the risks” allegedly posed by TikTok, testified before the inquiry.

Paterson evidently personally consulted with members of the US government while chairing a
parliamentary inquiry into foreign interference conducted through social media. This inquiry was
transparently aimed at attacking the Chinese government and TikTok, in alignment with US strategic
objectives. This example demonstrates that allegations of misinformation and foreign interference
through social media can be weaponised to serve the interests of entities such as TikTok’s competitors
(the social media companies which fund ASPI), and the US government.

### 7. Conclusion
It appears that ACMA’s proposed powers will enable censorship under the guise of preventing alleged
election interference or undermining democratic institutions. Sensationally hyping so-called “statelinked information operations” on social media provides valuable media fodder and justifies mass
purges of accounts, as genuine users with undesirable views can be deleted along with alleged statebacked bots. It also provides “evidence” to push for policy change—for example, the hearings of the
current parliamentary inquiry into Foreign Interference through Social Media were stacked with ASPI
associates. The alleged threat of foreign interference through social media also allows for guilt-byassociation attacks—such as ASPI’s claim that the Chinese government is covertly promoting the
Australian Citizens Party’s social media accounts. If ACMA’s proposed powers are legislated, would the
ACP be censored as a result of ASPI’s allegations?

The ACP accepts that social media is rife with misinformation and disinformation; but the only way to
combat it is to publicly refute it, not censorship. Thinkers have struggled with the implications of free
speech for centuries, and concluded that limiting speech is far more dangerous to society than the
regrettable consequences of false claims. That’s why free speech is enshrined in the First Amendment of
the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press”. And why it is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Hu- man Rights,
which Australia helped to draft in 1948: “Every- one has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” (Emphasis added.)

Social media is a double-edged sword: it can be a channel for the worst misinformation and
disinformation, but so can governments, as we have witnessed; alternatively, it can also be the medium
that exposes government and corporate lies that the corporate mainstream media won’t, which re

# Documentation: the ACMA social media censorship bill
 and its Orwellian implications


_By Bob Butler_

The Australian Government has released a draft Commu
nications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (“the Bill”) by which it
claims to “keep Australians safe online”. Minister for Communications Michelle Rowland claimed: “The Albanese
Government is committed to keeping Australians safe online, and that includes ensuring the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has the powers it needs
to hold digital platforms to account for mis and disinformation on their services.”

The Bill has been introduced following the Australian

Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019, which highlighted the significant risks posed by the “infodemic” of misinformation and
disinformation shared on digital platforms, and after the introduction of the Government-requested voluntary code of
conduct for disinformation and news quality by certain digital platform services. The proposed powers implement the
key recommendations in ACMA’s June 2021 report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms’ disinformation
and news quality measures.

Under the Bill, ACMA (established by the Australian Com
_munications and Media Authority Act 2005) would be grant-_
ed new and enhanced powers to combat allegedly harmful
misinformation and disinformation online, and to impose significant financial penalties for non-compliance with the new
restrictions. The Bill proposes to insert its provisions into the
Commonwealth’s Broadcasting Services Act 1992 as a new
schedule of provisions related to digital platform services.

ACMA would be granted the power to compel digital

platforms to maintain records related to misinformation and
disinformation and these records would have to be handed
over upon request. ACMA would have the authority to request that digital platform service providers prepare a voluntary “code of practice” for the industry, outlining strategies to
combat misinformation.

Companies failing to adhere to this code could be subject

to penalties of up to $2.75 million or two per cent of their
global turnover, whichever is higher. Finally, ACMA would be
able to establish and enforce its own industry standard. Violations of this standard could lead to companies being fined
up to $6.8 million or five per cent of their global turnover.
ACMA’s powers would extend to various online platforms, including social media, news-aggregators, and podcasts. ACMA
would not have the authority to remove individual pieces of
content, and the new powers would not apply to certain excluded content including professional news content.

Minister Rowland: “Mis- and disinformation sows divi
sions within the community, undermines trust and can threaten public health and safety”.


The Bill defines “misinformation” and “disinformation” as

follows (with the key difference being “intent”):

  - “misinformation” is online content that is false, mis
leading or deceptive, that is shared or created without an
intent to deceive, but that is reasonably likely to cause or
contribute to serious harm. [S7(1)]

  - “disinformation” is a subset of misinformation that is dis
seminated deliberately or with an intent to deceive or cause
serious harm. [S7(2)]

For misinformation to be covered by the Bill, it must be

“reasonably likely that it would cause or contribute to serious harm”. For harm to be serious, it is intended that it must
have severe and wide-reaching impacts on Australians. Examples provided in the Bill include inciting hatred, vandalising critical communications infrastructure, serious financial or
economic harm or serious harm to the health of Australians.
It would appear to be focused on misinformation shared socially, rather than professionally—for example, “conspiracy
theories” rather than information that is accidentally incorrect despite a publisher’s best intentions.

The Bill defines the “digital platform services” to which

it applies and takes a three-layered approach to defining the
“digital platform services” that are within the scope of its
powers. These services are broadly defined [S4(1)], referring
to digital services that:

1. collate and present content from a range of online sourc
es (content aggregation services) [search engines, websites];

2. enable online interaction between multiple end-users

(connective media services) [Facebook, Twitter etc.];

3. provide audio-visual or moving visual content to end
users (media sharing services) [YouTube, Rumble, Bitchute
etc.]; and

4. other digital services specified by the Minister.
As a result, a significant category of broad digital plat
forms and digital platform service providers will be within
the scope of the Bill—ranging from social media channels
to search engine sites and peer-to-peer marketplaces. However, digital services will not be captured to the extent that
they are internet, SMS or MMS service providers. [S4(1)(e)-(f)]

In claiming to balance freedom of expression with the

need to address online harm, the Bill outlines a number of
exceptions, including:

1. content produced in good faith for entertainment, par
ody or satire;

2. professional news content and authorised electoral

content;

3. content authorised by the Commonwealth, State or Ter
ritory governments; and

4. content produced by or for accredited education pro
viders.

The Bill also requires that in determining whether or not


4 **Australian Alert Service** 19 July 2023 Vol. 25 No. 29 citizensparty.org.au


-----

to register a voluntary code, ACMA consider: (i) whether the
code burdens freedom of political communication; and (ii)
if so, whether the burden is reasonable and not excessive,
having regard to any circumstances the ACMA considers relevant” [S37(d)]. A similar requirement applies in respect of a
“Standard” (in effect a compulsory code) which ACMA proposes to issue [S40(d)].

The Bill also provides in relation to freedom of political

communication:

_60 Implied freedom of political communication_
_(1) The provisions of:_
_(a) this Schedule; and_
_(b) the digital platform rules; and_
_(c) any misinformation code registered under Part 3; and_
_(d) any misinformation standard;_
_have no effect to the extent (if any) that their operation_

_would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom_
_of political communication._

Digital platforms currently self-manage approaches to

misinformation or disinformation. This may take the form of
collective industry codes of practice, such as the DIGI disinformation code of practice—a code that major technology companies such as Microsoft, Twitter, TikTok and Google
have signed up to in recognition of their “role as important
actors within the Australian information ecosystem”.

The Bill gives ACMA the power to step in where industry
led self-regulation is determined by ACMA as inadequate, or
where ACMA considers that it fails to remedy misinformation and disinformation. Specifically, the proposed powers
would enable ACMA to:

1. gather information from, or require digital platform pro
viders to keep records about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation; [S14]

2. publish information on its website relating to misinfor
mation or disinformation regulation, measures to combat this
issue, and the prevalence of such content—both on individual platforms and at an industry level; [S25-28]

3. request the industry develop “misinformation codes”—

codes of practice covering measures to combat misinformation and disinformation (that ACMA could then register and
enforce); [S29-44] and

4. create and enforce “misinformation standards”—in
dustry standards (a stronger form of regulation than a code
of practice) where ACMA deems a code of practice is ineffective. [45-56]

Notably, ACMA will not have the power to request spe
cific content or posts to be removed from digital platforms or
have a role in determining what is considered truthful. Digital platforms continue to be responsible for the content they
host and promote to users.

This purports to recognise the challenging balance be
tween the desire to ensure free speech online; the role of digital platform providers in determining, and being responsible
for, the quality and nature of content on their own platforms;
and the safety risks posed by certain forms of online content—
such as those already regulated by the eSafety Commissioner.

Further, ACMA will not be able to use its powers in rela
tion to private messages [Ss 14(3), 19(4), 34]—save for, perhaps, its information-gathering powers to ensure service providers collect information about key risks.

Nonetheless, it is clear that the proposed legislation is de
signed to reserve the ability for ACMA to force platforms into
line where self-regulatory codes and practices have failed.

**Penalties**

Digital platforms that do not comply will face substantial


penalties—up to, the greater of, AUD$6.88 million or 5 per
cent of global turnover for corporations (in recognition of the
size of digital service providers), and up to $1.38 million for
individuals [Inserted as S205F(5H) into the Broadcasting Ser_vices Act 1992 (Cth)]. This is in addition to warnings, reme-_
dial directions and other “softer” remedies available at ACMA’s discretion.

ACMA, like many other instrumentalities, is structured

to be independent of, and not accountable to, Government.
Section 15 of the Australian Communications and Media Au_thority Act provides:_

_15 ACMA not otherwise subject to direction_
_Except as otherwise provided by or under this or any oth-_

_er Act, the ACMA is not subject to direction by or on behalf_
_of the Commonwealth._

Section 14 of the Australian Communications and Media

_Authority Act provides the only Ministerial control mecha-_
nism in the Act, in these ambiguous terms, providing:

_14 Minister may give directions to ACMA_
_(1) The Minister may give written directions to the ACMA_

_in relation to the performance of its functions and the exer-_
_cise of its powers._

_(2) However, such a direction can only be of a general_

_nature if it relates to:_

_(a) the ACMA’s broadcasting, content and datacasting_

_functions; or_

_(b) the ACMA’s powers relating to those functions._
_(3) A direction under subsection (1) must be published_

_in the Gazette._

_(4) The ACMA must perform its functions, and exercise_

_its powers, in a manner consistent with any directions given_
_by the Minister under subsection (1)._

_(5) This section does not affect the Minister’s powers un-_

_der the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to give directions to_
_the ACMA_

Schedule 8 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in its

summary states provides that “The ACMA may make online
content service provider rules about gambling promotional
content provided on an online content service in conjunction with live coverage of a sporting event.”

Section 27 of Schedule 8 gives a further limited power of

direction over ACMA for these limited circumstances:

_27 Minister may direct the ACMA about the exercise of_

_its powers_

_(1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, give the_

_ACMA a direction about the exercise of the powers conferred_
_on the ACMA by this Schedule (other than Part 4 or 5). (Those_
Parts relate to complaints and enforcement).

**What are the problems with the proposed legislation?**

I agree with the opinion of David Coleman, Shadow Min
ister for Communications, that “this is a complex area of policy and government overreach must be avoided”. He added: “[The] public will want to know exactly who decides
whether a particular piece of content is misinformation or
disinformation.”

That is one of the serious issues with the proposed legis
lation. The Bill’s vague definitions of “misinformation” and
“disinformation” are open to interpretation and abuse by
those making decisions about that interpretation, apart from
the issue of who decides what is “misinformation” or “disinformation” and what is “harm”.

As to the Bill overall, it has been noted that George Or
well wrote the book Nineteen Eighty-four in which a totalitarian government regulated the truth and that it is quite a
coincidence that on Orwell’s 120th birthday, the Australian


citizensparty.org.au Vol. 25 No. 29 19 July 2023 **Australian Alert Service** 5


-----

Government has announced that it would introduce legislation which heads down that path, here in Australia.

That comment is reinforced by Section 2 of the Bill in its

definition of “excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the following:

_(e) content that is authorised by:_
_(i) the Commonwealth; or_
_(ii) a State; or_
_(iii) a Territory; or_
_(iv) a local government.”_
In other words, anything authorised by Government can
not be held to be misleading.

One only has to consider the Government position on the

Iraq invasion, or during the COVID period or the background
behind what is presently occurring in Ukraine—the government position cannot be classed as “misleading”, unlike any
position which opposes that Government line.

Discussion and opinions as to the Bill which focus on its

aim to remove “misinformation” and “disinformation” from
the internet, concentrate on the large providers such as the
Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI) adopted by eight digital
platforms—Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, TikTok,
Redbubble, Apple and Adobe.

The Bill, however, is not limited to those large platform

providers but extends to all digital platform providers, whatever their size, the summary in the Bill noting:

“The ACMA may make digital platform rules requiring

digital platform providers to keep records and report to the
ACMA on matters relating to misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services. The ACMA may obtain information, documents and evidence from digital platform providers and others relating to those matters. The ACMA may
publish information relating to those matters on its website.
Bodies or associations representing sections of the digital platform industry may develop codes in relation to measures to
prevent or respond to misinformation and disinformation on
digital platform services. If the ACMA registers a misinformation code, digital platform providers in the relevant section
of the digital platform industry must comply with the code.

“Where there is no registered misinformation code, a reg
istered misinformation code is deficient or there are exceptional and urgent circumstances, the ACMA may determine
a standard to provide adequate protection for the community from misinformation or disinformation on digital platform
services. Digital platform providers are required to comply
with misinformation standards that apply to them.”

The Bill has clearly given primary (if not sole) consider
ation to the largest platforms like Facebook, Reddit and Twitter etc. and yet has brought in-scope (intentionally or unintentionally) thousands and thousands of community websites that are part of the “social web” due to its broad definitions. The law is way too broad, and is not structured in any
way to give regard to the size of platforms that it applies to.

A standard requiring small platform providers to keep re
cords, hand over documents, attend to give evidence and to
face enormous penalties for alleged breaches would be extremely onerous and concerning. In that regard it should be
borne in mind that there are many websites that offer social
features that come within the definition in S4 of the Bill of a
digital platform service being a digital service that is a content aggregation service, a connective media service, a media sharing service or (the catchall phrase) a digital service
specified by the Minister. Without any specific limitations on
a Code, the Bill potentially gives the largest digital services
in an industry the ability to not only write their own regulations in the form of a Code but for that Code in its terms to


be such that it could
damage their smaller
competitors by their
risking infringements
and onerous regulatory requirements.

The EU has intro
duced this regulatory
type of legislation (the
_Digital Services Act)_

George Orwell and his famous book about

but has defined large a government permanently at war, which
providers as VLOPs regulates “truth”.
(Very Large Online
Platforms) or VLOSEs (Very Large Online Search Engines)
and they are treated separately by the European Commission.

If ACMA determines some content to be “misinformation”

or “disinformation” it can at its option issue a warning, a remedial direction to the provider, or other “softer” remedies,
or impose a penalty. The penalties are potentially huge and
would quickly cause most companies or individuals to comply and exclude or remove the complained-of content or go
out of business unless they chose to get involved in expensive Court proceedings to determine whether or not the material did fall within the definitions in the Bill.

There is no limitation in the Bill of what “standards” might

be imposed by ACMA if it decided to issue a standard applying to particular suppliers (or all suppliers) rather than endorse a voluntary code.

The Bill is also expressed to apply extraterritorially, S12

providing:

_12 Extra-territorial application_
_This Schedule extends to acts, omissions, matters and_

_things outside Australia._

The requirements of the Bill are accordingly expressed to

apply to any platform provider anywhere in the world. Any
breach of this proposed new standard would see international tech giants liable to pay a steep maximum penalty with
fines of up to $6.88 million (US$4.6 million) or 5 per cent
of global turnover. For perspective, 5 per cent of Facebook’s
parent company Meta’s global turnover amounts to approximately $8 billion (US$5.3 billion).

The alternative to such a reach would be to block plat
forms which did not comply with a code or standard, apparently a step too far for Government in relation to this Bill.

My general thoughts:
It is difficult to see how this legislation in its present form

could be simply amended to make it workable without incorporating unacceptable risks of the Nineteen Eighty-fourtype consequences.

It should not be administered by an unaccountable body

but administration by the current political class would be of
comparable concern.

If there is to be any limitation on content, it should be

clearly and unambiguously defined. There are many obvious examples, we can all think of things that should not be
broadcast, but it is difficult to define them in some general
way. There should not be any definition which incorporates
an ability to determine what is “truth”.

There should be a capacity to have any such objectionable

content removed by the service provider—perhaps with the
sanction of blocking the site until it is removed. There should
be a differentiation in the way smaller socially-oriented platform services are categorised and treated as opposed to the
substantial international services.

# ASPI central in global censorship network

_By Melissa Harrison_

An Australian defence think tank which takes money from

foreign governments is driving the push to censor supposed
“foreign influence” operations on social media in Australia.
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which is funded by the US State Department, the British, Dutch and Japanese governments, and is heavily sponsored by multinational
weapons manufacturers, is smearing the Australian Citizens
Party (ACP) and its highly effective campaign against bank
branch closures, as examples of “Chinese covert influence
operations” which should be censored from social media. ASPI’s attack on the ACP coincides with the Australian government’s release of new legislation to censor alleged “harmful”

many Graphika staffers formerly worked for US intelligence
and national security agencies, and numerous others were educated at King’s College in London, the notorious “school for
spooks” which is headed by former NATO, military and intelligence officials. Graphika staff also participated in the now
discredited Institute for Statecraft’s infamous “Integrity Initiative”, which was exposed in 2018 as an international media
and political influence operation to spread anti-Russian propaganda, covertly funded by the UK and US governments,
NATO, and Facebook.

Graphika has partnered with online media giant Google

to counter alleged Spamouflage activity. Graphika has also
partnered with the Washington, DC-based Atlantic Council,
a NATO- and US/UK government-funded think tank which
effectively operates as an arm of NATO, on a number of joint
projects to analyse social media bot activity. The Atlantic
Council has extended its influence over social media companies through the work of its Digital Forensics Research Lab
(DFRLab), which partnered with Facebook in 2018, ostensibly to identify and counter election disinformation and interference. This partnership gave DFRLab unprecedented power to curate the news items which Facebook users could see.

Graphika’s intense focus on the Spamouflage network took

off in April 2019 after the company appointed former NATO
press officer and Integrity Initiative participant Ben Nimmo
as its Head of Investigations. Nimmo was credited as the lead
author of many of its reports on Spamouflage. Prior to joining
Graphika, Nimmo was a non-resident senior fellow of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab, which he had co-founded. In February 2021, the Atlantic Council published an anonymous
26,000-word report titled “The Longer Telegram: Toward a
new American China strategy”, which effectively called for
regime change in China.1 One week later, Nimmo left Graphi
ka to join Facebook as its Global Threat Intelligence Lead.

Graphika is not the only intelligence-connected organ
isation which attributes Spamouflage activity to the Chinese
government. Since at least 2019, Google and Facebook have
worked with cybersecurity firm Mandiant to identify and
counter alleged Chinese and Russian cyber-influence activity. Mandiant, acquired by Google in 2022, was formerly a
subsidiary of FireEye, a company which was launched with
funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s investment arm, and counts
the CIA as a client. ASPI’s cyber-interference reports contain
numerous references to Mandiant’s research. Coincidentally,
in June 2022 both ASPI and Mandiant simultaneously identified Spamouflage as the culprit behind an alleged Chinese
state-backed information operation which targeted an Australian rare earths mining company.

In addition to ASPI’s deep ties to the defence industry, AS
PI’s staff also have connections to the intelligence sector. This
includes ASPI’s Executive Director Justin Bassi, who was formerly Cyber Intelligence Mission Manager at the Office of National Intelligence (ONI), Australia’s peak intelligence organisation. Bassi infamously wore CIA cufflinks inside the Australian Senate, while serving as an advisor to Attorney-General George Brandis. Other ONI alumni include Dr Alexandra
Caples, director of ASPI’s International Cyber Policy Centre,
which has produced the majority of ASPI’s cyber-influence reports. Another previous ONI staffer is former analyst and team
leader of the ONI’s Open Source Centre, Danielle Cave, who
is now ASPI’s director of Executive, Strategy & Research. Cave
has co-authored many of ASPI’s reports which allege that the

Chinese government is conducting cyber-enabled foreign influence operations. Cave’s work includes the aforementioned
articles which claimed that a Chinese state-backed bot network was promoting the Australian Citizens Party.

**ASPI leads online censorship campaign**

Numerous independent media publications have exposed

social media companies’ willingness to act as a censorship
arm of the US government. Documents leaked in 2013 by
whistleblower Edward Snowden, a former contractor to the
CIA and US National Security Agency (NSA), revealed that
“Five Eyes” (USA, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand)
intelligence agencies worked closely with Big Tech to conduct mass internet surveillance. ASPI, which received funding
from social media giants Facebook, Twitter and Google, has
functioned as a key player in this global censorship fraternity, which involves powerful think tanks, Big Tech, and intelligence-connected organisations. This censorship network cooperates to create and drive allegations that foreign governments, particularly China and Russia, are conducting cyberinfluence operations through social media.

Since 2018, Twitter has periodically announced mass purg
es of accounts which have been deemed “state-linked information operations”, which Twitter primarily attributes to China and Russia. However, in official testimony Twitter has appeared to hedge its bets, calling them “potentially” or “suspected” state-backed information operations.2 Nevertheless, ASPI

has repeatedly relied on Twitter’s announcements as evidence
that the Chinese government is the architect of Spamouflage.

ASPI has enjoyed a privileged position as one of three se
lect “research partners” to receive early and exclusive access
to Twitter’s “state-linked” bot account datasets. ASPI works
closely with Twitter to apply “analytic and _narrative con-_
text” to Twitter’s datasets (emphasis added). Although at times
ASPI has admitted that it did not have access to Twitter’s raw
data to verify independently that bot accounts were actually
linked to the Chinese government, ASPI’s analysis, which has
been paid for by Twitter (see Box), has supported Twitter’s decisions to permanently remove hundreds of thousands of accounts which have been attributed to Chinese “state-linked
operations”. Another of Twitter’s partners is Graphika collaborator and research partner the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). SIO is headed by Alex Stamos, an advisory board
member of NATO’s Collective Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, who joined Stanford from his role as Chief Security Officer at Facebook. In April 2023, representatives of SIO
were guest speakers at ASPI’s invitation-only Sydney Dialogue,
which was sponsored by Meta, Facebook’s parent company.

Participants in this global censorship operation have done

exactly that which they accuse the Chinese government of
doing. For example, as reported by investigative journalism
website The Grayzone on 2 November 2021, one week before the November 2021 Nicaraguan elections, social media giants Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (Google) and Instagram
launched a massive censorship sweep of social media accounts, including those of media outlets, journalists and activists, which supported the left-wing Sandinista government.
Facebook refused to distinguish between real people and alleged spam accounts, justifying mass account deletions by
claiming that all were state-backed bots. Nicaragua has previously been subject to US government-sponsored destabilisation efforts, including a violent attempted coup d’état in 2018.

Similarly, Graphika played a key role in the coordinat
ed government-media-intelligence operation to destroy the
election campaign of UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. When Corbyn made damaging revelations about his opponents’ intent to sell off Britain’s national healthcare system
to foreign interests, Graphika swiftly produced highly publicised “research”, led by Ben Nimmo, which suggested that
Corbyn’s documents were part of a Kremlin disinformation
campaign. Graphika’s allegations allowed the media to deflect attention from Corbyn’s revelations, by smearing him as
a vehicle for a supposed Russian disinformation operation.

**The big question**

Since 2019, sensationalised reporting of Spamouflage has

supposedly “outed” China as the culprit of this covert cyberinterference campaign. Because of this, any other bot campaigns which can be linked (however tenuously) with Spamouflage, such as ASPI’s supposed Australia-targeting bot network, can also be conveniently blamed on the Chinese government. However, Spamouflage’s attribution should be taken with a grain of salt, as it invariably comes from organisations which have proven aligned with the interests of the US
government; are closely connected to intelligence agencies;
or are associated with Anglo-American propaganda operations, such as the Integrity Initiative.

Despite China’s alleged authorship of Spamouflage, social

media companies consistently acknowledge that Spamouflage has very low-quality content and virtually zero organic
engagement or reach, meaning that it is totally ineffective as
propaganda. Why would the Chinese government persist in
conducting such an ineffective and politically damaging foreign influence operation?


Although totally ineffective as a Chinese government pro
paganda campaign, Spamouflage and its associated bot networks are a highly useful Five Eyes propaganda tool. Sensationally hyping so-called “state-linked information operations” provides valuable media fodder and justifies mass
purges of accounts, in which genuine users with undesirable
views can be deleted along with alleged state-backed bots. It
also provides “evidence” to push for policy change—for example, the hearings of Australia’s recent parliamentary Inquiry into Foreign Interference through Social Media have been
stacked with ASPI associates. The alleged threat of Spamouflage also allows for guilt-by-association attacks—such as ASPI’s claim that the Chinese government is covertly promoting
the Australian Citizens Party’s social media accounts. It is evident that the primary beneficiary of the Spamouflage network is not the Chinese government; it is the US government
and its Five Eyes allies.

The US government is certainly capable of conducting a

“false flag” social media bot campaign to be blamed on the
Chinese government. On 17 March 2011, the Guardian revealed that the US military had contracted a private company, which was headed by a thirty-year veteran of the CIA, to
develop sophisticated software that would let the US military
“secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online
personas to influence internet conversations and spread proAmerican propaganda”. These inauthentic “sock puppet” accounts could appear to be based anywhere in the world. It is
not far-fetched to consider that this software could be repurposed for other social media manipulation campaigns. Hence
the obvious question: Is the US State Department funding ASPI
to produce reports on so-called Chinese cyber-influence bots,
which are actually a tool of the US government?


## ASPI’s funding reveals role as foreign influence conduit


The Australian Strategic Policy Institute presents itself as

an “independent, non-partisan” policy think tank, despite
evidence of its overwhelming bias towards the geopolitical interests of the United States and other Five Eyes nations. ASPI has been the primary agitator in Australia against
the Chinese government, and is leading the insane drive
to war. ASPI’s funding sources, however, prove that its socalled “independence” is a farce.

The majority of ASPI’s funding comes from the Austra
lian federal government, but ASPI also receives funds from
foreign governments, the private sector, and the arms industry. In 2021-22 15.6 per cent ($1,939,442) of ASPI’s total funding was sourced from foreign governments, including Five Eyes nations the United States, United Kingdom,
and Canada; and the governments of Japan and the Netherlands. A whopping 76 per cent ($1,483,760) of ASPI’s
foreign government funding in 2021-22 was provided by
the United States, dwarfing its next-largest contributor the
UK, at 15 per cent ($296,862).

Notably, ASPI’s “sources of revenue” graph in its annu
al report of the previous year (2020-21) did not include a
$5 million payment from the US government to establish
ASPI’s Washington DC branch over the next two years. Instead, this funding was recorded separately to ASPI’s overall sources of revenue, because ASPI claimed it would “create a mismatch between income and expenses in the next
two financial years”.

In 2021-22, 10.7 per cent ($1,339,990) of ASPI’s fund
ing was sourced from the private sector. This included
$500,000 from Meta (Facebook) to sponsor ASPI’s 2023


invitation-only Sydney Dialogue, and an additional $135,000 for “corporate sponsorship”. ASPI received
$99,656 from Twitter for “disinformation/takedown data
analysis works support”, which evidently refers to ASPI’s help in facilitating Twitter’s mass purging of alleged
state-backed “inauthentic” accounts. Google contributed
$70,000 to ASPI in 2021-22. In addition to funding contributed in 2021-22, ASPI has received significant funding
from social media giants Google, Facebook, and Twitter
over the last four years, which coincided with ASPI’s escalating allegations that the Chinese government is conducting cyber-influence campaigns through social media.

Unsurprisingly, as ASPI functions as Australia’s war-pro
pagandists-in-chief, ASPI also receives funding from the
world’s largest arms manufacturers and has deep ties to the
defence industry. In 2021-22, 3.3 per cent ($410,182) of
ASPI’s funding came from “defence industries”, including
weapons manufacturers Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Omni,
Saab and Thales. A 1 April 2021 article by Marcus Rubenstein for APAC News documented that, since its founding
in 2001, ASPI’s defence industry sponsors have raked in
over $51 billion in Australian government contracts. Rubenstein documented that 49 of ASPI’s other sponsors,
who do not manufacture weapons, have benefited from
over $30 billion in Australian defence contracts. A 20 January 2022 investigation by online publication MintPress
News revealed that many of ASPI’s senior council members have had deep connections with the arms industry,
including serving in executive positions on the boards of
large weapons manufacturers.

# ASPI’s ‘cyber-interference’ allegations: more junk research


_By Melissa Harrison_

Canberra’s chief warmonger, the Australian Strategic Pol
icy Institute (ASPI), is hell-bent on driving Australia into conflict with our largest trading partner, China. For several years
ASPI has repeatedly accused the Chinese government of conducting foreign interference operations against Australia. ASPI’s dubious “research”, however, has been consistently debunked and discredited by the Australian Citizens Party and
other researchers. The latest iteration of ASPI’s Chinese influence hysteria is “cyber-enabled foreign interference”, or
“state-backed information operations”, which are ostensibly
conducted through social media platforms.

**Cyber-enabled election interference**

ASPI alleges that foreign governments—invariably those

targeted by Anglo-American strategic agendas—have used social media to interfere in (primarily Western) elections. However, ASPI’s allegations are overwhelmingly sourced to Western mainstream media publications and think tanks, and intelligence-connected organisations.

In a 2019 report, Hacking democracies; Cataloguing cy
_ber-enabled attacks on elections, ASPI claimed that China_
and Russia were the main perpetrators of cyber-enabled foreign interference in elections in 20 countries between 2016
and 2019. ASPI’s analysis was based on incidents which were
publicly reported by sources such as mainstream media; US
government-funded propaganda organ Voice of America; NATO-affiliated think tank the Atlantic Council; and intelligenceconnected cybersecurity company FireEye. Hacking democ_racies was produced with funding from the Australian Com-_
puter Society (ACS), the representative body for the information and communications technology sector, and included
a foreword authored by ACS president Yohan Ramasundara. ASPI did not disclose that Ramasundara also worked for
the Australian government, as Director of Business Futures at
IP Australia.

One of ASPI’s examples of election interference includ
ed mainstream media claims that in 2017, persecuted Australian journalist and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had
acted as the “principal international agitator” in the lead-up
to the Catalan independence referendum, because Assange
criticised the Spanish government on Twitter. ASPI wrote that
Assange was “promoted and amplified by Russian state-sponsored media outlets and Twitter bots”. The charges against Assange were levelled by the Atlantic Council’s Ben Nimmo, a
key participant in a global censorship operation involving Big
Tech and intelligence-connected organisations, which accuses the Chinese and Russian governments of foreign interference through social media. (“ASPI central in global censorship network”, AAS, 9 Aug. 2023.)

ASPI relied on hearsay to claim that Australia had been

the target of election interference. On 18 February 2019
Prime Minister Scott Morrison sensationally announced that
hackers had targeted Australian political parties. Despite acknowledging that the Australian government had not specified which state was responsible for the alleged operation,
_Hacking Democracies attributed the attack to China, because_
“many commentators had publicly identified China as the
most likely” culprit.

**Questions over ASPI’s methodology**

In March 2022 ASPI launched the US State Department
funded “Understanding Global Disinformation and Information Operations” website, which displayed interactive


visual representations of alleged “state-linked information operations” conducted on Twitter. The website used datasets provided by Twitter, with “context of geopolitical tensions” added by ASPI. Anglo-American geopolitical targets Russia, Iran,
China and Venezuela, along with Saudia Arabia, were alleged
to be the most prolific perpetrators of cyber-enabled foreign
interference. However, although ASPI admitted that much of
the data was “spam” or commercial content, ASPI’s methodology did not adequately filter out commercial tweets that
ran concurrently to the alleged influence operations, making
it “difficult to identify and assess the most significant content
shared in the datasets”, which comprised hundreds of millions
of Tweets. There are questions over whether these were actually state-backed information operations, as ASPI and Twitter
claimed. In the example of China, the top ten most-shared
links of these alleged Chinese government cyber-interference
operations included a British hamper company; “Happy Muslim Family”, a relationship advice website; and numerous defunct websites and broken links.

ASPI works closely with Twitter to provide analysis to sup
port Twitter’s mass purges of accounts deemed Chinese statebacked information operations, and has received funding
from Twitter for this work. However, ASPI has admitted that
it did not have access to Twitter’s relevant data to verify independently whether accounts actually were linked to the Chinese government.

**Poor evidentiary standards**

ASPI’s evidentiary standards for attributing social media

“bot” activity to the Chinese government are very low. Its 24
July 2023 article titled “China’s cyber interference narrows
in on Australian politics and policy” is a typical example.
ASPI analysts alleged that Chinese state-backed social media
“bots”—automated software which engages on social media,
usually using fake accounts which mimic real people—were
interfering in Australia’s domestic and foreign policies. ASPI
claimed these bots criticised Australian spy agencies, AUKUS,
the US-Australian alliance, and ASPI itself; and promoted the
views of “certain individuals”, naming former Prime Minister Paul Keating and the Australian Citizens Party (ACP), who
are outspoken critics of ASPI’s warmongering against China.

Conspicuously missing from ASPI’s analysis is a curious

phenomenon: the majority of these so-called Chinese government bots, which comment on Twitter posts of the ACP
and its members, have also posted spammy content lauding
US Republican Senator Marco Rubio. Rubio is a well-known
agitator against the Chinese government. Why would Chinese state-backed bots promote China-basher Marco Rubio?

The basis for ASPI’s claim that these bots were part of a Chi
nese government operation came down to ASPI’s assessment
that they displayed “behavioural traits” which linked them to
“Spamouflage”, a larger spam network which social media
companies and various intelligence-connected organisations
have attributed to the Chinese government.

ASPI claimed that this supposed Chinese state-backed bot

network was linked to “transnational criminal organisations”,
suggesting that the Chinese government was now utilising organised crime networks to conduct its cyber-influence operations. However, this sensational allegation was based solely
on ASPI’s assessment that the Australia-targeting bot network
was connected to another spam network which promoted
the Warner International Casino. ASPI described Warner casino as “an illegal online gambling platform operating out of
Southeast Asia and linked to Chinese transnational criminal


6 **Australian Alert Service** 16 August 2023 Vol. 25 No. 33 citizensparty.org.au


-----

organisations”.

ASPI claimed that the Australia-targeting bots and the War
ner Casino bot networks were connected because the accounts had similar stock photos or used AI-generated images as profile pictures; or tweeted the same nonsensical comments, or phrases which were typically cut off mid-sentence.
ASPI also claimed that the Warner-promoting bots posted
“CCP propaganda”; however the only example ASPI provided was a single half-sentence tweet, which stated: “The Third
Plenary Session of The sixteenth Central Committee clearly developed people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable d—”. An internet search shows that, like
other Warner bot posts, this so-called “CCP propaganda” was
just a phrase scraped from online content, from the now-defunct China Geological Survey website. ASPI claimed that
four Warner-promoting bots were also linked to “CCP covert
influence operations targeting Australia”, however the only
content these accounts have published was related to nuclear waste dumping from Japan’s Fukushima disaster. Despite
the paucity of evidence, ASPI’s claim that so-called Chinese
government bot accounts were linked to international criminal syndicates was promoted by Australian mainstream media.

**‘Operation Honey Badger’**

ASPI’s April 2023 policy brief, the

US State Department-funded Gaming
_Public Opinion,_ typifies ASPI’s questionable standards of analysis. Gam_ing Public Opinion,_ which alleges
that the Chinese government conducts global “covert cyber-enabled
influence operations”, was peer reviewed by ASPI staff and anonymous
“external reviewers from industry and
government” (ASPI does not specify which government). ASPI loftily claimed that “only a few
research teams globally have the capability and right mix of
language, analytical, technical and data skill sets” to analyse cyber-influence datasets disclosed by social media platforms. ASPI named itself, intelligence-connected cyber-analytics firm Graphika, and Graphika’s research partner the Stanford Internet Observatory, as three organisations which possessed this capability. These organisations have worked closely with Big Tech companies to purge hundreds of thousands
of social media accounts on the basis that they were deemed
“state-linked information operations”, although investigative
reporting has identified that genuine users with views undesirable to the Anglo-American establishment have been deleted along with alleged state-backed bots.

In Gaming Public Opinion, ASPI presented a case study of

an alleged Chinese government “cyber-enabled influence operation”, which ASPI claimed was a new iteration of the socalled Spamouflage bot network. The authors of Gaming Pub_lic Opinion sensationally announced that they believed it was_
“possible” that Chinese government agencies had named this
propaganda campaign “Operation Honey Badger”. However,
the only evidence provided to support this was a Tweet posted
by an account which ASPI claimed was “likely to be affiliated with the CCP”, which showed a screenshot of a computer
desktop that displayed a Chinese-language version of the text
of an alleged Spamouflage-associated blog post (which could
have been copied and pasted from anywhere). An additional browser tab, of which the contents are hidden, was titled
“Operation Honey Badger”. Despite this ludicrously flimsy
“evidence”, ASPI devoted considerable effort to ruminating
over the possible motivation of the alleged name—“it’s unclear


why this operation was named Operation Honey Badger but
there a few plausible explanations. One reason could be that
honey badgers are known for fighting larger predators in Africa, southwest Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In this operation, the honey badger might be representing the PRC fighting the hegemony of the US which is symbolised as a larger
predator. Operation Honey Badger could also possibly be a
reference to a CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation operation to find Chinese moles and investigate why Chinese informants were disappearing in 2010”.

ASPI claimed that this new Spamouflage spin-off pro
moted the narrative that US government intelligence agencies had conducted cyber operations against China, and portrayed China “as a victim of false hacking accusations”. As
ASPI observed, the artistic style and imagery of “Operation
Honey Badger” was similar to previous bot campaigns which
ASPI has linked to Spamouflage. In all of these supposed Chinese state-backed campaigns, the imagery used is of very
poor quality, and includes misplaced text and poorly edited
screenshots. The juvenile and crude cartoons are extremely
off-putting and invoke a negative reaction towards the poster, rather than any sympathy for the message—hardly the desired outcome for a supposed propaganda campaign with the
resources of the Chinese government behind it.

ASPI assessed that Operation Honey Badger accounts were

part of the alleged Chinese government operated-Spamouflage
network because the accounts “share the same characteristics”, including “the use of Western female personas” and AIgenerated profile pictures, and because they shared the same
links. ASPI also noted that Operation Honey Badger posts were
“mostly published during the Beijing time-zone work week
and business hours”, omitting the inconvenient fact that numerous other countries share the same time zone as Beijing,
as does Western Australia. ASPI claimed that the operation
was also active on Chinese social media sites, “confidently”
linking 200 accounts to Spamouflage because those accounts
shared the same images and “rarely had original profile images and instead used either default images, cartoons or pictures of female models, all of which Spamouflage-linked accounts on Western platforms often used.”

ASPI claimed that “some evidence suggests” that Opera
tion Honey Badger accounts were “possibly affiliated” with the
Yancheng (Jiangsu province) Public Security Bureau, a provincial government policing organisation, and the Chinese government’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS). However, there
are serious questions over the reliability of ASPI’s “evidence”.

ASPI claimed to have geolocated Operation Honey Bad
ger posters to Jiangsu, where the Yancheng Public Security
Bureau is located. However, ASPI’s analysis relied upon the
“social listening services” of Norwegian software company
Meltwater, which can only “infer” geolocation based on information which the poster publicly provides. Additional “evidence” ASPI provided to link Operation Honey Badger to
Chinese policing and security organisations, was that several
fake accounts only followed the social media accounts of the
official Traffic Police Detachment of Yancheng Public Security Bureau; the MPS; or “New Police Matters”, which is published in a government newspaper. ASPI’s “evidence” also included two Weibo (Chinese social media platform) accounts,
one of which appeared to have a “selfie” of a Chinese police
officer as its profile picture, and another account which used
a Jiangsu police station as a profile image.

ASPI claimed that while police officers “were likely in
volved in coordinating Spamouflage propaganda campaigns”,
the operation of most fake accounts was “possibly” outsourced
to a “specially trained—and ideologically sound—group of


citizensparty.org.au Vol. 25 No. 33 16 August 2023 **Australian Alert Service** 7


-----

‘internet commentators’” employed by Chinese government
agencies. An example of ASPI’s dubious standards of analysis
can be seen in the think tank’s profiling of an alleged Spamouflage-linked account, which was supposedly operated by
one such hired internet commentator. ASPI hypothesised that
this Yancheng-based account was “most likely operated by a
young male”, because the user had bookmarked posts “warning men not to take their girlfriends travelling unless their relationship is strong enough or they’ll break up” and “‘common
sense’ facts about women that men might not know”. Without evidence, ASPI theorised that he was probably a part-time
student living in Yancheng. Because the user had previously


bookmarked articles about registering for self-study examinations in Jiangsu, ASPI asserted he was “unlikely to be a public servant because it’s generally difficult for students without
a university degree to get those jobs”. It is difficult to understand how ASPI considered such meaningless hypothesising
to be worthy of inclusion in a US government-funded report.

Ultimately, ASPI admitted its “analysis” did not prove any
thing: “To be clear: while we unearthed potential links, we
didn’t find sufficient publicly available evidence to say with
full confidence that Yancheng Public Security Bureau or MPSaffiliated individuals are directly operating Spamouflage accounts.”


# Labor’s ‘renewables are cheapest’ lie exploded


_By Richard Bardon_

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Energy Minister

Chris Bowen’s mantra that “firmed renewables” are the cheapest pathway to a so-called net-zero greenhouse gas economy, and that the alternative zero-emissions technology, nuclear, is the most expensive, is based upon blatantly deceptive modelling that hides the overall costs of the former and
exaggerates those of the latter. Independent analysis by physicist and data analyst Aidan Morrison shows that the annual
“GenCost” report produced by national science agency the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s (CSIRO) and gas and electricity systems overseer the
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), to which Bowen habitually refers as proof that “renewables” are cheapest
_at present, in fact projects that they will eventually become_
_cheapest after 2030; and it does so by writing off the enor-_
mous upfront expense of all the major projects which must
be completed before then as “sunk costs”. For current “full
system costs”, the CSIRO passes the buck to the AEMO’s Integrated System Plan (ISP). That report, however, does not properly account for the full cost of renewables either, and does
not examine the costs of nuclear at all. It would seem that in
energy as in so many other policy areas, at best Labor is simply not up to the job, and at worst is deliberately deceiving
the Australian public.

The 24 January Australian Financial Review reported that

in response to criticism from nuclear advocates that he and
Albanese were “hiding behind the cost argument” to conceal their ideological opposition to nuclear power, “Mr Bowen said the latest CSIRO GenCost report showed nuclear energy was by far the most expensive form of energy in Australia. ‘Even if Australia started working on a nuclear energy industry now, it wouldn’t be operational by the end of the decade, with nothing to help reduce energy costs for Australian households and businesses in the meantime’, he said.
‘The same GenCost report shows firmed renewables, with
_transmission and storage, are the cheapest form of energy,_
and getting cheaper every day. That’s why the Albanese government has made huge investments in renewable energy,
like Marinus Link in Tasmania and VNI West Link in Victoria. These projects will open up Australia’s renewable energy capacity … while putting downward pressure on power
prices.’” (Emphasis added.)

There is no ambiguity here: Firmed renewables, with trans
_mission and storage, “are” the cheapest, Bowen says. In the_
present tense, meaning now, today. But not only does the
2022-23 GenCost report say no such thing, in fact it explicitly
_excludes the costs of all “transmission and storage” infrastruc-_
ture that has yet been built, or will be in the next 17 years. As
the report’s lead author, CSIRO Chief Energy Economist Paul
Graham, acknowledged in a 29 July letter to the editor of the


_Australian newspaper: “LCOE [the levelised cost of electrici-_
ty] is a simple metric [used in the report] for non-modellers to
understand the relative costs of energy from different generation technologies. The method essentially calculates the cost
per MWh [megawatt-hour] that would have to be recovered
for a new electricity generation investment to break even if it
_were to take place in a given year such as 2030. The report_
_does not provide the cumulative cost of all investments up to_
_2030…. All existing generation, storage and transmission ca-_
pacity up to 2030 is treated as sunk costs since they are not
relevant to new-build costs in that year.” (Emphasis added.)

Again, there is no ambiguity here. If Bowen is not sim
ply lying outright, then he has either not read, or perhaps has
read but not understood, the report on whose basis he peddles falsehoods to the people of Australia.

**Designed to deceive?**

Arguing in favour of the latter, is that the GenCost report

seems tailored to bamboozle. In its executive summary—
mayhap the only part of such a document that Bowen would
bother to read, however crucial a complete understanding of
its subject matter might be to his portfolio responsibilities—
the report states that “The LCOE is estimated on a common
basis for all technologies. However, an additional process is
undertaken to calculate the integration costs of variable renewables. The required amount of additional investment depends on the amount or share of variable renewable energy (VRE) generated. … When added to variable renewable
generation costs and compared to other technology options,
these estimates indicate that onshore wind and solar PV remain the lowest cost new-build technologies.” The blunt admission that all investments that have been and will be needed up to 2030 have been dismissed as “sunk costs” and not
factored in, however, is buried in a footnote on the 85th of
the report’s 97 pages.

What makes this so misleading, Aidan Morrison explains

in an analysis published 23 July at economist Dr Cameron
Murray’s “Fresh Economic Thinking” blog, is that integration
costs per MWh of renewables over the course of the “transition” are nowhere near as constant or uniform as the GenCost report seemingly seeks to imply. “The supporting infrastructure comes in big, lumpy projects, highly specific to the
geography and meteorology of a grid”, Morrison wrote. And
by 2030, by which time we are supposed to have surpassed
50 per cent renewables, almost all such projects will need
already to have been built. “We can see this on page 52 of
the report, which describes their ‘Business As Usual’ scenario, i.e. all the projects which are specifically excluded from
the incremental costs of integrating new solar and wind”,
Morrison noted (emphasis in original). “It’s packed full of
