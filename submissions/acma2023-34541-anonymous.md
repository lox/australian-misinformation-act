Re: Feedback        - Combatting Disinformation and Misinformation Bill 2023

I am writing to express my deep anger and outrage regarding the draft bill titled
"Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
# Disinformation) Bill 2023". As an Australian citizen, it is disheartening to see that our
Government does not respect our freedom of speech with the existence of this bill.

One of the most concerning aspects of this bill is the creation of two classes of
citizens. The first class includes politicians, journalists, and members of educational
# institutions who will have the power to spread information online, whether it is
deemed true or false. On the other hand, the second class consists of regular citizens,
# who often possess more knowledge about certain topics, such as industry insiders.
This classification threatens to silence the voices of regular people and undermines
the democratic ideals that the internet has provided.

Furthermore, the excessive fines imposed by this bill will result in digital services
becoming more restrictive than ever before. The code's universal application across
the entire industry without any "pressure escape valves" exacerbates the potential
harm to freedom of speech. Such constraints will not only stifle open and honest
discussions but also hinder the progress of informed debates.

The task of accurately judging what is true or false is an impossible one. Information

is dynamic, continuously evolving, and new discoveries often contradict previously
accepted facts. To illustrate this, I would like to present several examples of
statements that were once considered factual by authorities and expert consensus
# but were later debunked: masks not protecting from COVID-19, absence of evidence for human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, complete prevention of COVID-19
transmission through vaccination, and the misconception about the required number
# of vaccine doses. Under this legislation, content similar to the aforementioned
examples could be deemed public health harm-causing misinformation and subject
# to removal. This demonstrates the potential for overreach and disproportionate
censorship.

Furthermore, the bill's inclusion of "misleading" or "deceptive" information, even if
true, adds another layer of concern. Freedom of speech serves as a crucial
cornerstone of open and honest dialogue, allowing room for people to be wrong,
and for truth to be sought through debate and discussion. This bill risks eroding the
value of freedom of speech and stifles the progress that comes from conflicting
ideas.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, who is
well-acquainted with the challenges of handling health information, raised serious
concerns about the scope and application of this bill via his personal Twitter account.
His tweet, dated 25th June 2023, highlights the difficulty of implementing such
legislation, as it opens the door for fines to be imposed on information that may turn
# out to be true after all.

If expert consensus is touted as the basis for this bill, it is troubling to witness one of
those very experts expressing such criticism. This raises questions about the bill's
# credibility and its alignment with the pursuit of truth rather than censorship.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the "Communications Legislation Amendment
# (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". It not only undermines our freedom of speech but also risks disproportionately silencing the voices of
regular citizens. I implore the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider this bill and ensure that
# freedom of speech is upheld and protected in Australia.

Yours sincerely,

Submission can be made PUBLIC, without disclosing my personal details.
