**Submission To ACMA** **27.6.23**

I am a highly experienced Chemical Engineer and have worked in Research as a Research Engineer,
and so know how to read and interpret research and papers detailing this research.

Throughout history many scientific discoveries that have been made have been made by dedicated
people going against the prevailing thought – and in nearly all cases their theories would have been
classed as “misinformation” at that time.

And it is truly astonishing, and worrying, that legislation is being proposing to suppress
“misinformation” yet much of this so called misinformation has a very solid scientific basis. I will
firstly cite some examples from very recent history, here in Australia, during the Covid era where
government policy was mostly complete misinformation, and tragically many have been sickened,
maimed and killed as a result of these recklessly wrong policies, which were unjustified and are now
acknowledged by many as misinformation.

There is every reason to believe that if this legislation is passed that our government will again
silence those putting out “misinformation” whilst all the while actually misinforming and misleading,
and as a result wrecking livelihoods, hurting, damaging or worse the Australian people.

Some relevant recent examples.

Masking
Masking was pushed by all levels of government across this country during the covid period, yet
there is no randomised control trial showing masks effective against viruses, but plenty that show
they are not. There are also plenty of peer reviewed studies I can point to which show all sorts of
harms coming from masking in terms of significant reduction in concentration (yet people were
urged to drive whilst masked…), headaches and reduced oxygen impacting on the immune system.

When I posted this peer reviewed science and questioned the prevailing (wrong) government policy I
was removed from a social media site as I was “misinforming” people. It is now a matter of record
that in fact I and others citing the same research were completely correct, and the government
totally wrong to enforce this ineffective and dangerous policy.

Lockdowns
With lockdowns it was similar where study after study showed them ineffective and highly
damaging, yet to question lockdowns during the covid era was “misinformation”. My posts at a
leading newspaper website, citing this peer reviewed research were constantly removed. Then the
Shergold enquiry in 2022 laid bare that lockdowns and border closures were of little to no effect on
covid 19, yet devastating to countless businesses, and wasted hundreds of billions of tax payer
dollars on unjustified policies.

Again, here we have the government itself ignoring countless scientific studies and peddling
misinformation and in the process ruining countless businesses and creating a tsunami of mental
health issues, all the while claiming that those, like myself, who questioned lockdowns were the
problem.

Some older examples.

Albert Einstein, one of the pre-eminent scientists of the modern age was in his early days in
Germany ridiculed and his theories continuously attacked. No doubt many of those attacking him
would have accused him of peddling “misinformation” with his theory of relativity. In fact the book


-----

“One Hundred Authors against Einstein” was published in 1931, denouncing Einstein and his
theories.

Nowadays it is totally clear that these “experts” who accused Einstein of misinforming people were
in fact completely wrong, yet at the time it was the prevailing wisdom that Einstein was misguided
and pushed falsehoods.

Michael Crichton, the late famous author and also qualified medical doctor, was well known for his
concerns about the “consensus of science” which is a term which is getting increasing currency these
days. This has been particularly used by government bureaucrats and politicians when pushing
policies which all too frequently are unjustified and where there is little actual basis. Those who
question these govt policies are accused of “misinformation”

In 2003 Crichton gave a lecture on “consensus” in science where he cited many examples in history
of where the prevailing scientific notions throughout history were frequently dangerously wrong,
and those who sought to overturn them with clear evidence were often ridiculed and accused of
misinformation.

The examples he gave were nearly all in the medical area and two examples were that firstly that in
1795 it was discovered that women dying in childbirth were dying of infections. The discoverer could
treat women and avoid these needless deaths, but he was pilloried and attacked, yet it was slowly
realised that in fact his “misinformation” was in fact totally correct and millions of womens lives
have been saved as a result.

A second example related to pellagra, a disease that impacted on tens of thousands of Americans in
the 1920s. At the time it was claimed it was an infection, but a researcher showed that it was linked
to poor diet. He was accused of peddling misinformation, and it took years to realise that he was in
fact correct, and nowadays we know that a niacin deficiency causes pellagra, not an infectious
disease. Many lives and much suffering is now avoided.

One further example from today. It was only up until recently that homosexuals were regarded very
negatively and government policies backed this up. Homosexuals were thought of as dangerous and
frequently physically attacked, with little action against the perpetrators taken. Those who spoke out
against this were shunned and would probably have been accused of “misinformation”. Fortunately
we have moved away from those benighted times, but just remember that if the proposed
legislation was in place the movement out of that era would have been far more difficult, and may
not have occurred.

In closing, we have the very recent examples in the covid era, and I can provide even more
examples, if necessary, of wrong policy in that era that was in fact misinformation. Then we have, as
Michael Crichton touches on, many many examples throughout history where those questioning
established policy, often pushed by governments, are accused of misinformation, when in fact they
were correct.

The proposed legislation is extremely dangerous as it will stifle needed debate on government and
other policy. The fact that this will put significant government resources into removing voices
frequently citing sound science and demonstrating good research is a disaster as this will entrench
bad policies and make it far more difficult for us to make our way out of problems created by
reckless and wrong government policy.

As we saw with covid, this wrong policy has ruined many lives, wasted huge sums of money and if
entrenched by this legislation it is very likely this will occur yet again.

The answer here is that we do not need to have those questioning to be labelled as peddlers of
misinformation and silenced. We need to actively welcome debate and differing opinions. Wrong
ideas, when aired and properly discussed, will be seen for what they are and wither naturally.

We need freedom of speech, not some government entrenched censorship as proposed by this
legislation.
