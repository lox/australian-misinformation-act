**Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill - These changes must not be allowed.**

The proposed government changes will further destroy free speech and prevent the discovery of TRUTH.

The Australian government is already exercising censorship of mainstream news services via the ‘Trusted News
Initiative’. This already enables the government to provide a controlled narrative of news information to the
public and to limit alternative opinions and discussion.

Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are already exercise censorship via
‘fact-checking’ algorithms.
This corporate control has been initiated and supported by the cooperation of USA government departments
with corporate social media platforms.

The presence of ‘RMIT Fact Checkers’ on the Australian Facebook platform is direct evidence that the
Australian government is already working with these corporations to control the Australian social media news
narrative.

Examples of where Australian government censorship has recently prevented the discovery of TRUTH.

1. The COVID-19 vaccinations were neither effective nor safe:

     - Most of the Australian population contracted COVID, despite 95% of the Australian population
having received 2 doses of government approved COVID-19 vaccinations.

     - Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows significant increases in ‘all cause death rates’ with a direct
temporal relationship to COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia.
The same phenomenon is found in all countries with high vaccination rates.

**2.** The Australian government support of USA and NATO in the Ukraine war:

     - Failed to consider the historic events that triggered Russia to invade Ukraine, being that NATO
continued its westward expansion of NATO to the border of Russia, against repeated demands of
Putin to keep Ukraine neutral.

     - Controlled the thinking of Australian minds via the relentless, one sided news narrative Putin ‘evil’, Zelenskyy ‘hero’.

     - Failed to demand the pursuit of a diplomatic solution.

     - Contributed to the death of 750,000 Ukrainian soldiers and 150,000 Russian soldiers.

     - Brought the world to the brink of nuclear Armageddon.
