Dear Director.
Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts

I am writing to express mv deep concern and disgust regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combattina Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I firmlv believe that this bill
infrinaes upon our freedom of speech and disregards the principles of democracy that our nation fought for over the
years and continues to uphold.

Firstly, it is evident that this bill creates a distinction between two groups of citizens, granting politicians, iournalists,
and members of educational institutions the authority to disseminate information, reaardless of its accuracy. However,
ordinary citizens, who often possess valuable knowledae on various topics, are marainalized and silenced. This
skewed hierarchy not only undermines the power of regular people but also poses a threat to the democratic values
that our society cherishes.

The internet is a remarkable platform that has empowered ordinary individuals to have a voice and contribute to public
discourse. However, this leoislation jeopardizes the riahts and voices of evervdav citizens disproportionately. The
imposition of exorbitant fines will compel diaital services to impose stricter restrictions on speech, surpassina even the
most stringent measures in place todav. Furthermore, the bill lacks anv safetv mechanisms to prevent the undue
consolidation of power within the industry, exacerbating the potential harm caused by this legislation.

One of the most sianificant concerns with this bill is the impossibility of accurately discernina between true and false
information. History has shown that what was once considered widely accepted fact has later been proven false.
Drawina from recent examples related to the COVID-19 pandemic. manv authorities and experts initially asserted
various claims, such as the ineffectiveness of masks and the absence of human-to-human transmission. These were
debunked at the time, but were later proven to be accurate.. Under this leoislation. such information could be deemed
as public health harm-causino misinformation and subiect to removal or penalties. The broad definitions of
"misleadina" or "deceptive" information further encroach upon the freedom of speech, hindering open discussions and
the pursuit of truth.

Even renowned experts, such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, have voiced
serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His Twitter post on 25 June 2023 highlighted the
challenges of implementing such leoislation and the inevitable levving of fines on information which mav turn out to be
accurate. If an expert of Dr. Coatsworth’s stature Questions the efficacy of this bill, it raises serious doubts regarding
the government's commitment to truth and freedom of expression.

Moreover, it is apparent that this bill primarilv targets prominent platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter,
while inadvertently or deliberately encomoassina numerous community websites and social web platforms. The broad
definitions present in this leoislation impose a tremendous legal risk, which unreasonably restricts individual freedoms,
the right of free speech and enterprise.

The bill's all-encompassing approach, akin to setting a speed limit on everv road qloballv without informing the public
of the limit itself, is profoundly concernino. Every website owner worldwide which allows user-aenerated content, such
as bloo comments or forums, becomes susceptible to fines up to AU$500,000 for individuals and AU$2,500,000 for
companies. The sheer lack of awareness surroundino the existence and compliance with industrv-created codes
places foreion website owners at risk of penalties imposed bv a law they are unaware of. This raises questions about
the practicality and enforceability of such jurisdictional assertions.

Additionally, the proposed bill appears contradictory to the News Media Baroainino Code (NMBC), enacted in 2021,
which imposes limitations on diaital services' ability to address misinformation and disinformation. While the NMBC
forces diaital services to remove olobal content from non-elioible news oraanizations if thev choose not to participate
in the Australian news industry, this bill promotes fact-checkers and other methods involvino news content as
potential remedies to counter misinformation. This inconsistency hiahliahts the need for comprehensive and
consistent legislation that upholds the principles of freedom of speech and the right to access information.

Furthermore, the deleoation of leaislative power to private entities, as seen in this bill, raises constitutional concerns.
Bv allowina companies to create Misinformation Codes that, when reaistered. become law. this bill proposes an
unconstitutional abdication of leaislative power. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), as a
statutory authority not directly accountable to Parliament, holds the authority to enact Misinformation Standards and

reasonably likely to cause or contribute to harm, raises leaitimate concerns reaardina the limitation of leaitimate
discussions. Public policies and scientific investiaations are hiahlv contested topics and stifling these debates
unreasonably restricts the implied constitutional freedom of political communication.

Moreover, the flow of information is vital for citizens to make informed decisions while participating in democratic
processes. By cateaorizina certain political partv viewpoints as misinformation and enablina their removal from digital
platforms, this bill obstructs voters' access to essential information, compromising the very essence of democratic
governance.

In conclusion, I stronalv urae the Department of Infrastructure. Transport. Reaional Develomment. Communications
and the Arts to reconsider the Communications Leoislation Amendment (Combattina Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is crucial to uphold the freedom of speech, protect democracy, and preserve the valuable
contributions made by ordinary citizens on diaital platforms. Any leoislation concernino misinformation and
disinformation must be carefully crafted to safeguard individual rights while fostering open and robust public
discourse.

I ask the question: Is any of this Bill really necessary??

Thank you for considering my submission and I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,

Sally Adams
Sallv Ai
