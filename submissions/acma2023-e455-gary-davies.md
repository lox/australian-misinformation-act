# The proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

I have become aware of the ideas proposed in the above bill.

We live in a country where ‘free speech’ (as long as it is presented in a polite and non-derogatory way) is the envy of many
people the world over.

For us to function as a Nation, it’s not necessary, nor desirable, that all of us agree on everything. It encourages one to
investigate and become more informed on the happenings around us.

To have a Government Statutory Authority such as the ACMA (a non-elected body) to decide what is ‘misinformation or
disinformation,’ is extremely dangerous.

Please reconsider the need for this bill. I would like to see it placed in the “it seemed like a good idea at the time” basket.

Sincerely

Garry Davies
