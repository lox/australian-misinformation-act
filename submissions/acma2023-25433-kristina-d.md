This concerns me greatly! Who decides what is and isn't disinformation & misinformation? It sounds more
like censorship. Do the guidelines change with each new government?

My experience during the covid "pandemic" was one of utter terror as I tried to share information with my
family via a Facebook Messenger group about alternative treatments coming from credible health
practitioners. They were not able to access the videos. They may have made different health choices with
that information that was blocked.

I attended a huge rally at Town Hall in Sydney where well over 40,000 were peacefully protesting. When I
got home to watch the SBS news I was very shocked to see it reporting that about 2,500 were in
attendance. That was misinformation by a well respected news agency and that kind of misinformation
seems to be encouraged. I stopped watching the 'news' & tell-a-vision after that.

So I am a firm NO to some random government backed agency deciding on what is and is not
dis/misinformation. I will decide that for myself thanks.
