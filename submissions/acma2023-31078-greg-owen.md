I demand that this draft bill be scrapped immediately.

In a proper functioning society people need to have all information available to them, they can then
evaluate and determine for themselves what is real (true) information and what is dis-information.
This is the people's right and a cornerstone of a free society. Australia needs a country of selfdetermining thinkers, not a mob of zombies unable to discern fact from fiction.

We do not need or want any person or body or corporation or government or NGO to decide what is
and what isn't disinformation. The intention of any such bill can only be to control the population by
means of brainwashing and deception.

Scrap this bill along with any other proposal from the WEF, WHO, UN or any other group that
doesn't respect & want Australia to be a sovereign nation.
