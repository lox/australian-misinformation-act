**Submission on the exposure dra� of the proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment**
**(Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023**

It is the height of arrogance for anyone to assume that they have a monopoly on the understanding
of “truth”. The public servants that seek the power to censor ideas they do not themselves believe
should consider the possibility that one day their posi�on of power may be swapped with their
antagonists, and they in turn will demand uncensored free speech. Bad ideas are humiliated and
destroyed by open free speech but enriched in the dark by censorship. Only the cowardly and
incompetent resort to censorship.

Free speech allows government incompetence or lies to be challenged. Even though many public
servants have honourable inten�ons, they are not immune to making mistakes, and dishonourable
people o�en gri� their way into posi�ons of government power. The concept of government
employees policing speech is anathema to anyone that respects the personal freedom and autonomy
of the public. Free speech is fundamental to the promo�on of peaceful protest when those with
power deliberately or inadvertently do the wrong thing.

Around the world and within Australia, the list of grievous government behaviour is long. Free
speech and protest has historically challenged government injus�ce and policy incompetence such
as:

  - Denial of women’s right to vote.

  - Persecu�on of homosexuality.

  - The white Australia policy.

  - Denial of ci�zenship rights for Aboriginals.

  - The Vietnam War dra�.

  - The “weapons of mass destruc�on” lie that led Australia into war.

  - Delayed banning of Mercury vaccine adjuvants and dental amalgams.

  - Delayed banning of lead fuel addi�ves.

  - Delayed banning of asbestos mining and use.

  - And on and on.

Any public servant that believes such terrible mistakes are “obvious” and could never happen again is
gullible and ignorant. The internet and online forums are modern public squares. In the public square
bad ideas may fester, but they will not grow. In the public square good ideas will gain acceptance and
promote societal progress. Reject online censorship of heterodox ideas.
