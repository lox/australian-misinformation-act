**Re: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**

**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)

Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe that this bill is a direct attack on the

freedom of speech and democratic principles that form the backbone of our society.

First and foremost, the existence of this bill demonstrates a clear lack of respect for the

freedom of speech of Australian citizens. By creating two classes of citizens, with one group

comprising politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions who have the

power to spread potentially false or misleading information online, and another group

comprising regular citizens who are expected to be subject to stricter regulations, the bill

undermines the fundamental democratic principles of equality and inclusivity.

The internet, in my view, is the most powerful democratic invention ever created. It has

provided a platform for regular people to voice their opinions and has allowed for the

dissemination of information that was previously inaccessible to the general public. This bill

poses a significant risk to regular people, who often possess valuable knowledge and insights

on various topics, by disproportionately restricting their freedom of speech.

Furthermore, the exorbitant fines imposed by the bill will result in digital services becoming

more restrictive in their approach to speech. Even the most stringent digital services at

present will pale in comparison to the level of restriction that will be imposed if this bill is

passed. Additionally, the bill's application across the entire industry without any "pressure

escape valves" exacerbates the potential harm caused.

The task of accurately determining what is true or untrue is impossible. New information

constantly emerges that contradicts previously widely accepted facts. The examples provided

in the draft bill, highlighting instances where authorities and experts initially provided

misinformation about COVID-19, further demonstrate this point. This legislation could

potentially classify such information as public health harm-causing misinformation, leading

to its removal. The inclusion of true but misleading or deceptive information within the scope

of removal only further restricts freedom of speech, as it inhibits open and honest discussions

necessary for reaching the truth.

It is disheartening to witness governments and individuals promoting bills like this one under

the guise of being on the side of truth, while disregarding the concerns raised by experts in

the field. For instance, Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of


-----

Australia, has expressed serious doubts regarding the scope and application of this bill via his

Twitter account. If even these experts are critical of the bill's implications, it calls into

question the credibility and effectiveness of the proposed legislation.

The industry bodies responsible for creating the industry codes outlined in this bill are often

influenced by and funded by the largest players in the respective industries. This creates a

significant risk of these codes becoming "anti-competitive wedges" that enable larger digital

services to establish onerous regulations, effectively excluding smaller competitors.

Consequently, the proposed bill not only grants larger digital services the ability to write their

own regulations but also allows them to unfairly disadvantage their smaller counterparts.

Moreover, this bill does not align with the principles of free-market competition, which have

been proven to help address misinformation and disinformation. Recent examples of

platforms such as Twitter witnessing a decline in user satisfaction due to their misinformation

policies have led to an emergence of alternative platforms where users can migrate to based

on their community expectations. This competition encourages platforms to improve their

policies and meet user expectations.

The proposed bill heavily relies on the current context of dominant digital services in

determining regulations, thereby disregarding competition regulators' attempts to lower

barriers to entry for new competitors. By imposing such extensive regulations on a global

scale, Australia risks isolating itself from the global internet community and impeding the

progress made by competition regulators.

Additionally, the proposed bill's broad scope extends its application to a multitude of

websites, including community websites that are part of the "social web." This demonstrates

a lack of consideration for smaller platforms that may be unable to comply with the industry

codes due to financial constraints or lack of awareness.

By imposing substantial fines on individuals and corporations for non-compliance with

industry-created codes, the bill creates an unreasonable restriction on freedom of speech and

enterprise. Website owners, especially those unaware of the existence or requirements of

these codes, may unknowingly face legal risks simply for operating their platforms. It is

impractical and unjust to expect foreign website owners, who may not be familiar with

Australian law or industry codes, to comply with the regulations outlined in this bill.

Furthermore, the bill's extraterritorial application with regard to digital services and the

potential impact on global platforms raises serious concerns. It implies that Australian

industry codes should apply to digital services worldwide, even if they are based overseas

and have no knowledge or representation in Australian industry bodies. Such an imposition

undermines the principles of national sovereignty and global cooperation.

It is important to consider how we would feel if other countries, such as China or Saudi

Arabia, demanded compliance with their regulations on Australian websites, potentially

infringing upon our freedom of speech and exposing Australians to legal jeopardy. It is

hypocritical to criticize other countries for similar actions while proposing legislation that

demonstrates a disregard for the principles we claim to uphold.

As an Australian citizen, I value our commitment to human rights and democratic values.

This bill directly contravenes Article 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human


-----

Rights, which protect the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and expression. By

categorizing certain viewpoints as misinformation and silencing dissenting opinions, the bill

undermines citizens' ability to engage in public discourse, make informed decisions, and

participate fully in the democratic process.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional

Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider the proposed Communications

Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This

bill infringes on the freedom of speech of Australian citizens, disproportionately impacts

regular people, and undermines the principles of democracy and inclusivity. I implore you to

prioritize the protection of democratic values, freedom of speech, and open and honest

discussions by rejecting this bill.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will give due importance to the

concerns raised by myself and many other concerned citizens.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Dabrowa
