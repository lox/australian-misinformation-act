If ACMA was truly worried about the adequacy of digital platform's disinformation and news quality measures, they
would have stood up long ago and stated that only one side was being deemed as truth and that they needed to fix
this so that people received a balanced view of these measures.

Freedom of expression is what democracy is about, having your own ideas and thoughts, not being dictated to as to
what you must believe.

Misinformation and disinformation does not pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, certainly to our
democracy or society. Democracy is about weighing up both sides of the argument and forming your own opinion on
the subject.

The Government is not allowing any information against their narrative and agenda, this is not a democratic process.
The only reason misinformation and disinformation pose a threat is to the Government as they wish to control what
we hear and don't hear. If they can call everything against their agenda as misinformation and disinformation than
you are left with their narrative as being the truth, which in a lot of cases is not. This then causes a threat to the
safety and wellbeing of democracy and society in Australians.

The media is supposed to give a balanced view of every argument, from which one can then make an informed
decision on that viewpoint, over the last 3 years that has changed and only one side of the argument is being made
available to the people on any subject involving Government statements. This bias is completely against democracy
and is oppressing a person's opinion and thoughts. People are able to make up their own minds, in a democratic
country, as to what they believe and not believe without being labelled and punished for their thoughts.

It is incredible that people are being banned from media platforms for simply having a view on something which is
against the view of the Government. Social media platforms, talkback radio and television shows discussing themes
and topics are a way for people to formulate their views in an informed way.

If the Government wanted this to be fair and equable then they would not be exempt from the process and their
statements could also be included in the process and labelled accordingly.

The findings on page 85 of ACMA's Adequacy of digital platforms disinformation and news quality measures is totally
biased toward the result that would assist the Government being able to control the population on everything that
they hear and see. This would enable ACMA to being able to control all information, news and reports that is
available by any media and is not a fair report for the people.

The Government is elected by the people to run the country in the best interests of the people, not to persecute
people for their views which may be contrary to what the Government want.

This Bill should not be approved as it is an erosion of the democratic process that all Australians live under.
