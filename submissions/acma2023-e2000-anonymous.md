My name is and I am contacting you to voice my immense concern about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’.
We all know the internet can be used to promote all kinds of information, some of which is untrue. But the answer is not to make
the government the arbiter of truth and to censor those it disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of
bad ideas with an open critique of those bad ideas is the only way the truth can prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience. Our nation
had it right all along. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it.

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. No better than countries like North Korea. That is not the Australia
we want to exist in and pass on to future generations.
The proposed bill is in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 says:
Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
The proposed bill violates freedom of speech.

I strongly reject this proposal.
