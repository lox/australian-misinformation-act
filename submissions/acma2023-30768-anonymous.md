# The Communica-ons Legisla-on Amendment (Comba7ng Misinforma-on and Disinforma-on) Bill 2023 is nothing short of alarming in its aAack on free speech.And as such it undermines the safety and wellbeing of all Australians, as well as to our democracy.

 This Bill must NEVER be introduced. It is uAerly totalitarian in nature. It aAributes extraordinarily dangerous powers to Australian Communica-ons and Media Authority. And totally exempts the government for any accountability for any and all misinforma-on.

 The Government already has the necessary power in place to take ac-on against criminal ac-vity, human trafficking, child exploita-on and hate speech. There is no need for this legisla-on.

 It is outright dangerous to bestow to any body the right to determine 'what is true' and to censor anyone who may ques-on the accuracy of government informa-on.

 We know that during the COVID government demanded social media companies implement aggressive censorship. Much of what what censored under the guise of 'misinforma-on' has seen been substan-ated by peer reviewed research as having been true. The censorship of true informa-on in fact caused immeasurable harm and even loss of life. For example anyone who ques-oned the safety of untested/ experimental vaccines was immediately censored. Yet it's now widely know that they are in fact unsafe. And many of us have lost rela-ves and friends to the vaccines. Even the government now recognises how unsafe they are and some vaccines have now been withdrawn by the government.

 Rather than learning from these errors and offering apology for the harm that censorship caused, the government is now with this bill aAemp-ng to enshrine into legisla-on the informal censorship arrangements forged during COVID.

 Aside from the example over COVID years it is apparent that this legisla-on gives to the government the power to censor all poli-cal opponents who may ques-on any government informa-on regardless of how false such informa-on may be.

 There is no shortage of examples of the government lying to its ci-zens about cri-cal maAers. For example in 2002 the Australian government lied to us about Iraq having weapons of mass destruc-on. 

 What we need is stronger legisla-on to hold government accountable. This bill does the very opposite, it explicitly exempts any government communica-on, of any level

# of government, from being considered misinforma-on or disinforma-on. This totally enshrines in legisla-on a total lack of accountability by government. The government is free to say whatever they wish no maAer how false it may be and censor anyone who may ques-on government informa-on. This bill enshrines into legisla-on the power of government to lie and censor and punish all aAempts to expose their lies.

 We do not need legisla-on that suppresses free speech. Free speech is the fer-liser of democracy. 

 Suppression of free speech is the building block of totalitarianism.

 NO NO NO to this Bill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Yours sincerely
