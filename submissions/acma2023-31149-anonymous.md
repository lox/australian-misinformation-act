**Feedback Submission on the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation**

**Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

As someone who cares about the truth, this proposed bill is a shameful piece of legislation

that would give any Australian Government the power to silence, discredit, chill, de
platform, delete, censor and remove the content and credibility of anyone with a differing or

inconvenient opinion than those sitting in Parliament House and their newly appointed

“Ministry of Truth - ACMA”.

It is a sad indictment on our current state of political discourse that a Government would

feel a Bill such as this is merited, given the misinformation that politicians spewed from their

mouths during the pandemic, and the falsehoods the mainstream media outlets printed and

spoke telling us the Covid vaccine was safe, 95% effective, prevented transmission and

would stop you from dying - when we have seen children, young men and women, mothers

and fathers dying from vaccine injuries, gaslit and marginalised by a legacy media and the

majority of house representatives.

I trained as a journalist and worked for many years in mainstream news and the biggest

media outlets. I have witnessed firsthand the complete disregard for truth by my former

industry and colleagues, and view with despair that objectivity, accuracy, curiosity, balance

and fairness have been replaced with click-bait stories and such repellent bias, its hard to

stomach reading outlets I once respected to see how low they have sunk playing to

ideological, political and authoritarian agendas.

There is a sickness in our society this Bill only serves to legislate. The idea that a

Government body should determine “what is true” given the daily reports of political

corruption, industry-capture of Government bodies, domestic surveillance and Five Eyes

intelligence gathering, silencing of political opponents, censoring of people who dissent,

and seeing credible scientific experts blacklisted and written off as kooks when they have

every scientific reason to challenge and question bad science dressed up as saviour

technology.

Most of us now know the lockdowns caused more harm than good, that a policy of

sheltering the most vulnerable and allowing schools and businesses to continue operating

would have prevented the untold suffering that continues far beyond the pandemic. Yet who

has been held accountable for the sky-rocketing suicides, the mental health problems that

will continue for years, the destroyed lives and businesses, destabilising the global

economy, providing an unprecedented wealth transfer to the global elite, eviscerating the

security of the working class, damaging the health and education of children and our

young, reducing public trust in public health and vaccines as well as damaging the

credibility of government funded bodies such as the TGA and global organisations such as

the WHO.

But still the Government continues to behave as if it did the right thing. And that it was right

to silence its critics on social media platforms and shut down the voices of those who rightly

questioned the lockdowns, the mandates, questioned the vaccine, questioned the

censorship. It is well documented the Australian Government put pressure on social media

companies to blacklist and censor those brave enough to stand up and call out the

mandates, the pharmaceutical companies, their criminal behaviour, the lack of product

testing - or that evidence pointed to a lab leak from Wuhan - instead calling it

misinformation and disinformation.

We now know that lives and careers were ruined and Australian citizens were denied

information that could have saved their lives. Not from a virus, but from a rushed,

experimental vaccine using a brand new platform of delivery, that has caused thousands of

adverse reactions in Australia, disabled and maimed people, and caused countless

preventable deaths in both children and adults.

We were starved of the debate. Scientists, doctors and academics speaking out were

deregistered and silenced. Millions of us had our posts removed and received Facebook

bans for sharing factual evidence and scientific or expert opinions challenging claims that

we now know were false.

When you have the “leader of the free world” President Biden telling us, “If you're

vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in the IC [intensive

care] unit, and you're not going to die” which is all factually incorrect, and a dangerous

claim to make, given plenty of people took him at his word and died after being vaccinated

and did end up in the IC Unit, you have to wonder what ACMA are going to label

misinformation.

And it wasn’t just the President of the United States making such claims. Politicians and

media outlets in Australia all came out with their own versions of this lie, making false

claims about the safety and efficacy of a indemnified product that was rushed to market,

and has subsequently caused untold misery for all those injured by these products. The

mainstream media - exempted from this ACMA bill - were equally as complicit in sharing

misinformation and misleading the public on vaccine safety and effectiveness - let alone

colluding with Governments and discrediting anyone providing evidence of a lab leak. So I

certainly won’t be trusting the mainstream media to “tell me the truth” when I have seen first

hand what the jab-injured have had to endure and the suffering that continues as a result of

being shunned by a political class that would rather look away and deny responsibility.

The Covid Pandemic was a shameful episode in this country’s history and there has been

no sign the Federal or State Governments have learned any lessons, or shown any signs of

reflecting on their actions and really asking if what they did worked in the public good. The

lockdown/vaccinate strategy was highly beneficial to pharmaceutical giants and the super

rich and their corporations who saw a massive wealth transfer as small businesses went

under - but less good to the millions of ordinary people now struggling with a cost-of-living

crisis, inflation and the continued destabilisation of the global economy.

The mainstream media continues to avoid the issue of excess deaths, or show any interest

reporting on stories that show how Sweden and other countries that didn’t enforce

lockdowns or vaccine mandates had better outcomes all round.

But why would they care? Legacy media did well out of the pandemic. They profited from

record audiences hooked into fear programming and failed to do their job holding people to

account. So I ask you - why would I feel confident that a government appointed agency

entrusted with determining “truth” be anything but than a shill for Government Approved

Truth from Government Approved Sources?

This Bill is also a clear case of Government overreach into my mind - and my ability to think

freely and for myself - in appointing ACMA as a Government Approved Arbiter of Truth. We

are supposed to have free speech in this country. Freedom of expression and the ability to

be able to disagree and protest peacefully and voice dissent. This Bill is just another piece

of legislation designed to erode our ability to hold Governments to account, when we can

already see the levels of corruption and ideological agendas running rampant in every

branch and root of our Governance system, and the blurred lines and revolving doors

between Government ministries, industry, corporations and multinational behemoths

dominating through donations to parties or providing backing and funding for public

initiatives that serve their interests.

To think that this Bill will give ACMA the power to determine what is misinformation by fining

Social Media companies and taking down posts, as it doesn’t fit the political agenda of the

day, is deeply concerning.

I don’t need the World Health Organisation or any other global quango telling me what it is I

should believe. I have my own mind to do that for me. I can see when I’m being lied to and

gaslit, and I can see when someone is trying to pull the wool over my eyes and deceive me.

I can see when I am being misled on a product, and I can feel when marketing claims are

untrue. It is just as well I have developed these abilities as I was able to avoid becoming

another jab-injured and discarded, gaslit and abandoned Australian citizen unable to share

their stories on social media in case it created vaccine hesitancy. Disgusting.

I can also see with my own eyes that highly venerated scientists who spoke out on the

issue had their lives, careers and reputations destroyed for daring to raise qualified and

evidence based lines of question or going against the advice of the World Health

Organisation.

The result of this is that I have been left with zero trust in public health as we were so

misled and lied to. And I have zero trust in the Government and its appointed agencies

deciding truth for me. What person in their right mind would trust the Government’s

judgment over their own, and disavow or disregard what we have subsequently learned

about the Australian Governments and its agencies censoring, deregistering and

discrediting its own citizens during the pandemic, simply as they questioned the narrative or

advice given by the World Health Organisation, which I may add is an unelected

organisation funded and backed by profit driven pharmaceutical corporations, that is also

aligned with the World Economic Forum, another unelected body with a disproportionate

amount of influence over policy, and the lives of Australian citizens.

There is absolutely no way I am going to trust the judgment of those bodies I see to be

unduly influenced, or corrupted, captured by industry or dependent on industry funding,

misguided, flawed, politically or ideologically motivated - or who use their collective power

to stamp out anyone who challenges their position, and cancels the opposition.

Where is the scientific rigour? Where is the the debate? Why is it that inconvenient stories

and publications get buried and experts have been chilled into silence.

The idea that we must rely on legacy media for our truth - when they’re so dependent on

the same corruptive influences that have damaged the reputation and trust in so many of

our institutions - is laughable in an age young people don't watch the news, and where

many more people are switching off and turning to social media.

One of the biggest disappointments I have of the pandemic, is watching mainstream media

outlets sign up to the Trusted News Initiative - and losing any independence or ability to

question the narrative, or what we were being told by the World Health Organisation and

others.

To think we are now in an era where it appears Emergency Laws may be enacted for all

kinds of "emergency situations" decreed by the WHO giving Governments the legal power

to remove our constitutional rights “for the public good” only further serves to make this

proposed Bill even more concerning.

We were out of the pandemic a long time ago - but our state Government in WA has kept

up its Emergency Powers, and there simply is no justification for that. It just serves to

demonstrate how Governments enjoy giving themselves more power over our lives, but are

reluctant to give it back, eroding ever more trust.

That the Australian Commonwealth Government misled us over Covid and silenced critics

sharing inconvenient TRUE information, as Senator Alex Antics’ FOI requests show, one

wonders what will ACMA decide to censor once its been given the power to determine if

something is "misinformation."

I will also add that we are moving through a decade of rapid technological and scientific

advancement and the checks and balances are not in place to prevent misuse by the

political class and the administration that serves them. I don't see many politicians with

enough backbone to prevent an Ai powered version of Robodebt meets the Social Credit

System meets individual Zero Carbon targets meets a Controlled Digital Currency meets a

Global Vaccine Pass to travel and compulsory vaccinations thrown in - if they are told its for

public safety and given an emergency to rally around. The potential for public dissent to be

stamped out using this Bill is clear. It already happened in Covid. And so this Bill does

nothing to provide me with any peace, for it is just another piece of legislation paving the

way towards an authoritarian dystopian Orwellian future where the Government’s appointed

Arbiter of Truth decides what can / can’t be posted.

And so I object to this Bill. It grants ACMA powers to erode more of my freedoms and ability

to tap into the information I need to read, to keep myself sane, healthy and safe in a world

that’s in danger of losing its ability to ground in to what’s real.

In closing, I call this Bill out for what it is. A patriarchal, authoritarian attempt to control the

narrative, with the legislative firepower to silence any critics or credible evidence that would

make populations question what they were being told. Instead if this Bill gets passed, we

can look forward to the truth as told to us by cherry-picked official sources, the Trusted

News Initiative of legacy media outlets desperate for audiences and revenue - and continue

to see inconvenient truths wiped from our social media feeds.

This Bill is an attack on democracy, our basic human rights, our constitution, our freedom of

speech and our ability to hold Governments and governance systems to account through

ushering in “lawful censorship”. Think as your told, do not question what you’re told, and do

as your told. That seems to be what this Bill is about, dressed up as public safety and

wellbeing. I hold the intention it goes no further.

Thank you for your time.
