**SUBMISSION** **TO** **AUSTRALIAN** **GOVERNMENT**

**DISINFORMATION]BILL** **2023**

Eric John Scroop

To the relevant Parliamentary Members

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed Bill.In fact ,the crux of
the matter is just this,The ability to make comment freely and without recrimination.

Being a year old pensioner affords me the ability to have my personal view of past
# |
events and to research historical events of previous times. As can be seen with
Stalin’s USSR, suppression of voices ,not in line with government policy, created a
society frightened to speak up and halted /slowed its advance .

With the multitude of communications ,1 am **strongly** **opposed** to any
**censorship** ,bar the incitement to violence on person or property.lt is important for
the ability to have a robust discussion ergo Debate.In fact ,our society functions on
such.Within the Houses of Parliament across this nation ,Free Debate is the
norm.There is no suppression of voice[raised within the guidelines] which
contradicts and argues against the Government.

This Debate also functions in our Courts of Law between the lawyers promoting
opposing parties .Similarly the parties are protected against libel and slander whilst
in the Courtrooms.

Where Governments [State or Church] ,in previous centuries ,had suppressed
discussion and publication of views ,not in agreeance with the official line ,societal
advance was slowed in matters of science and health.Where the Earth was
considered the pivot for our universe, the earlier astronomers were unable to make
the model fit the evidence.Discussions with peers ,to change the model ,was risking
serious prosecution by Government,a possible death sentence.This delayed
mankind’s correct understanding of planetary motion.

Similarly the Flat Plane of the Earth Theory discouraged mariners to make extended
voyages ,this delayed the full exploration of the Planet’s Oceans.Voices dissenting the
Theory were opposed.

Also with Medical Science .The theories of blood circulation and other body systems
were not available to alternative paths of thought.Medical science stagnated until
brave individuals opposed the narrative , despite the threat of imprisonment or
death penalty,experimented and circulated the new information.


-----

Now with the Covid Era ,all views should be allowed Just as the population has to
decide what is true/untrue ,with the plethora of constant advertising in our
consumer world, then similarly with health saga.

My personal experience ,with those Australians close to me, is the vaccine/s have
caused harm to them.Suppression of alternative views to Government and Media
Line is detrimental to safety and survival of All Australians.

My request is-Do Not Censor Communications.

Sincerely yours, Eric John Scroop
