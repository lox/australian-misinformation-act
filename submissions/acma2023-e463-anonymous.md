Submission by re:

Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I strongly object to the proposal of the above Amendment Bill under
discussion at present.

Our Freedom of speech is being eroded day by day by certain members of
our parliament.

This quote is as valid today as when it was first spoken:

QUOTE “I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your
right to say it”.

The greatest purveyors of Misinformation and Disinformation were our
politicians shown during the recent Covid 19 LOCKDOWNS etc.

Anyone who spoke out against the orthodoxy of the so called “experts”
was put down or shut down from commenting. That has now been proven
to have been totally illegal. The ones who had varying ideas were in the
main correct.

Who are the “DISINFORMATON POLICE” going to be and how will they
be chosen?

This is totally against our Democratic Rights.

This Bill should not even have to be debated. It is against all human
rights.

If this Bill is passed does that mean that all belief systems including
religious doctrines,, “Dreamtime” etc. are to be classed as misinformation
or disinformation?

Anthropogenic Global Warming must then be classed as Misinformation
or Disinformation.

Australia is not a TOTALITARIAN COUNTRY - YET - Our current
Prime Minister seems as though that is what he wants though.

I am including a couple of sections from the Australian Human Rights
Commission to support my submission as hereunder.

Sections from: AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION
FREEDOM, INFORMATIN AND EXPRESSION:

(1) The UN General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on

Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 16 December 1966.

ICCPR Article 19 states:

Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all
kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the
form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article
carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be
subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are
provided by law and are necessary:

( a ) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

( b ) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public
health or morals.

(2) General comment 34 (open shut box)

(3) General Comment 34 emphasises that freedom of expression and

opinion are the foundation stone for a free and democratic society and a
necessary condition for the promotion and protection of human rights.
This General Comment addresses in detail:

(4)

(6) freedom of expression

(7) freedom of expression and the media
