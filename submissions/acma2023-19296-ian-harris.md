# Submission regarding Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

There are many problems with the idea of limiting “Misinformation” or “Disinformation”.

Things change, there is a saying I believe from the author Isaac Asimov: “Today’s science fiction is
_tomorrow’s science fact”. Let’s look at the real scenario that occurred, spraying humans with the_
pesticide DDT. There is a news article available which can provide more background available here:

In short, the USA used to spray humans with DDT to protect them from mosquitos and therefore
reduce the risk of contracting polio. The Government thought this was a great idea, and science at
the time supported these actions.

As the world progressed, more studies were undertaken on DDT which had findings resulting in the
eventual ban on spraying DDT on humans. The science soon supported the case that DDT could
cause the following problems: breast and other cancers, male infertility, miscarriages and low birth
_weight, developmental delay and nervous system and liver damage._

If people get sprayed with DDT and they soon after develop cancer, it’s not an entirely irrational
thought to suggest that the DDT may have caused the cancer. Someone may take to social media and
say something along the lines of “I got sprayed with DDT and then I got cancer, I think the DDT gave
me cancer!”. The Government acting under the guise of removing “misinformation” may well force
the removal of this post, thus eliminating the ability for society to see and perhaps act on what they
are reading.

Let us look at the case where 1000 people suddenly come forward with stories in which they got
sprayed with DDT and soon developed cancer. Surely after enough voices speak up, the scientific
community would then put more focus on the study of DDT and indeed discover that DDT may cause
cancer, as is now the widely recognised view. If we were to remove the 1000 posts from the people
who spoke out, the scientists may never become aware of the issue and may never be prompted to
study DDT more closely for these adverse outcomes.

As we all know, bureaucracy works at snail pace. The Government may like to think of itself as fast
and agile, however time has shown it is anything but. Before the Government can decide anything,
there must be an investigation by a body like ATAGI, a report/recommendation produced which then
informs the Government on how to proceed moving forward. This is not necessarily a bad process,
however after 3 months waiting for a report from ATAGI, 200,000+ people have already been
exposed to something and now have cancer or whatever. It is not a process that can react to the
science of the day.

It may be the case that what the Government today considers to be “misinformation” turns out to be
just information, and the Government’s own actions of trying to suppress what it believes to be

“misinformation” ends up itself harming Australians. This is not a good position for the Government
to be in and it is detrimental to the people of Australia.

Whilst it is true that here in Australia we do not enjoy constitutional rights that enforce the right to
free speech such as our USA friends enjoy, there is a general agreement on the basis of Human
Rights that we allow freedom of speech as long as it is not hate speech, threats or defamatory. The
idea that speech can be removed from social media on the basis of it being “misinformation” goes
against the principles of free speech.

In my opinion, in a society that does not censor speech, and I believe a truly free society does not
censor speech, and I believe that the best means of combating “misinformation” and
“disinformation” is to provide information.

We already see this solution in action today. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw platforms such
as Facebook identifying posts related to the COVID-19 vaccine and including a link to the
Government official view about COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that this is the best approach because it
allows people to continue to have their say under the principles of free speech, and it also provides
readers with the opportunity to see the Government’s view which may be contradictory. The
individual now has both views and can make their own decision.

When the Government says that it wants to remove “misinformation”, what the Government is really
saying is that it wants to remove the ability for us to think for ourselves.

it is a dangerous line to cross for the Government o start censoring speech, because anything the
Government of the day doesn’t like or support could be categorised as “misinformation”.

An example of this can be seen in the Brittany Higgins saga. Public opinion is widely accepted now
that the Labor Government used Ms Higgins to create a political weapon against the Government of
the day (LNP). Labor might say “anyone who says we weaponised Ms Higgins against the Coalition is
spreading misinformation!” and then it starts to censor the voices of people making such suggestion.
It’s just not great, any method of censorship can and will be abused by the Government of the day to
suit their agenda.

I believe that legislating a requirement for Facebook et al. to continue to provide information
disclaimers on a post, whenever a post that is considered “misinformation” is reported, is going to be
the significantly better option for our society, as opposed to this biil which seeks to provide the
Government with greater powers of censorship. I think any politician that supports this bill will see it
used against them when they are not the Government of the day, it is just far too easy for the
definition of “misinformation” to be twisted to suit an agenda. Dangerously easy, this bill is an
ignorant proposition.
