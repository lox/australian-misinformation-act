Hi there, I am writing in regards to my strong objection of the misinformation and disinformation bill that is
proposed. No one person or a group of people has a right to tell anyone else what they can and can’t say. It is a
violation of our freedom of speech. A perfect example is during the so called covid crisis. Many of what was labeled
misinformation or disinformation was later found to be the truth. Many people had their social media account closed
due to fact checking. How can anything be labeled misinformation or disinformation without 100% proof on the
matter. Very few thing are factual today and unless it is in can’t be misinformation or disinformation. It’s that
simple. Also the fact that government are exempt from this makes the whole thing even worse. I don’t believe the
government get many things right at all yet are exempt. That’s a joke. Also mainstreamed media are exempt, they
are just as bad as the government, if not worse and promoting misinformation or disinformation. Therefore I
strongly oppose this bill and think it should be terminated altogether. I also believe that it doesn’t matter what
99.9999% of the public think of a law/bill, it will be passed anyway as no law or bill benefits the majority.
