To whom it may concern:

I am making a submission in response to the proposed Misinformation Bill presently before
Parliament. The proposed Bill carries with it the destruction of free speech in Australia should it
ever be passed.

The government is trying to justify suppressing free speech on social media on the pretext of
stopping “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is “harmful”; however, each of those terms are
open to broad interpretation, which makes this bill potentially far more dangerous than any
perceived problem it seeks to address. Essentially, the government is seeking to squash Article 19 of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (see below).

To further amplify my reasoning, I only have to present the article in the Weekend Australian, July
22-23 2023, THE NATION p4, “Banned Covid Posts ‘Totally Factual’”

The newspaper article goes on to explain that “many of 4000 social media posts secretly censored
by government during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic contained factual information and
reasonable arguments rather than misinformation new documents reveal. … Senator Antic, who
secured this through freedom of information, said the revelations were gravely concerning to all
Australians who cared about freedom of speech. He said this amounted to a ‘censorship industrial
complex’ and raised fears about this type of intervention being expanded under the proposed
Misinformation Bill that would allow the issuing of multi-million-dollar fines against platforms
found to be hosting misinformation or disinformation.”

Here is a sample of the factual media posts that the federal government censored:

  - The Covid-19 vaccine does not prevent infection or transmission.

  - Covid-19 was released or escaped from the Wuhan Laboratory in China and was funded by
the US Government.

  - A vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it for an illness so bad you have to bej
tested to know you have it.

  - Lockdowns are ineffective.

  - Covid-19 can be easily cured using the drugs Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine.

  - Face-masks are ineffective against Covid-19.

All these “factual” statements contradicted “official” information and therefore the government
sought at every turn to censor this very factually based information. The government now wants to
dangerously expand its censorship powers after already showing its intent during Covid.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia in 1948 helped to draft,
states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to
hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.” When governments contrive pretexts to limit speech, they
are lurching down the dangerous path to totalitarianism.

There is a spiritual level to this drive towards totalitarianism. The more government leans toward
totalitarianism the more God will work against it. Bureaucrats and elected politicians will not
escape Divine punishment. Basically, the more government leans toward totalitarianism the more
God’s people will work actively against it through powerful and offensive prayer and courageous
civil disobedience.

I can’t make it any plainer than that.
Yours sincerely, Robert ( )
