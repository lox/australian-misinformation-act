# In the Missouri v Biden case ruling delivered on 4 July 2023 by Judge Terry Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, the court barred the White House and federal agencies from censoring social media posts.  The court found that millions of social media posts and speakers were censored all across America. It affected virtually every American who reads, listens, engages, or posts on social media about great disputed political and social questions that federal censors disapproved of and in response engaged censorship efforts to determine what was misinformation and, in the process, breach the First Amendment of the Constitution of the USA. The Louisiana court found that the platforms would not have suppressed this speech” and “often true content.” However, “federal officials were pushing for it.” Although Australia does not have such an expressed protection, we do have long standing implied freedoms of protection of free speech. It is not the government’s responsibility nor their entitlement as an occurrence of political power to censor the speech of the voting electorate and their right to criticise government. What this proposed legislation represents is the weaponization by an unelected committee to become empowered to determine what is misinformation and what is not information. This is an unprecedented push to undermine the very foundations of our democracy; the right to think, write, read, say whatever we want, and how we respond will determine whether we see a free press as inalienable or as optional. Misinformation and disinformation are synonyms for “information that may well be true but is inconvenient to a government that does not want to hear it and does not want the people to hear it.”

 If an Australian government committee can censor the government’s
 critics, that’s a license for every atrocity that follows in the wake of

 censorship and propaganda. It is the beginning of dystopia and the path

 to totalitarianism.
