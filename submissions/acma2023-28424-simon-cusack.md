 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Simon Cusack
2 August 2023

I'm writing to register my objections to the draft Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (“the Bill”).

1. Society must base its progress on open and free debate. Any attempt to categorise
what can and can't be discussed and how it is discussed is an attack on free and
open debate. This is an anathema to a liberal democratic society.

2. Society doesn't require oversight with respect to debate. It requires a common arena
in which all ideas can be discussed.

3. The two extremes of any debate will categorise the information of the other side as
"Disinformation" or "Misinformation".

Therefore it is not possible to define "Disinformation" or "Misinformation". As such the
proposed act is nonsensical.

What is actually required is;

1. A diverse and well funded media, to support and further serious debate.

2. A restriction on the political spend so that minority opinions cannot overwhelm the
debate.

3. Free and open access to the influence of lobbyists and corporations on our
government institutions.

a. All donations must be declared within 24 hours.

b. All politicians' diaries should be public.

c. There should be restrictions on employment arrangements moving between
government and private positions.

4. A strong and fearless public service.

5. Parliamentary discussions and decisions should be available to the public within a
month.


-----

To combat 'Disinformation' and 'Misinformation' first you need the actual Information to be
available to the public.

This act is an attempt to suppress open debate and I strongly object.

Please withdraw this Bill as a matter of highest priority.

Yours sincerely, Simon Cusack.
