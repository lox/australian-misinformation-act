      "Therefore, as conceived and written the Exposure Draft is unsatisfactory, illegitimate and contrary to Australia’s so called values; and should be abandoned.",
      "The solution to ‘misinformation, disinformation and mal-information’ has always been to ventilate the claims and prove them false or true using robust argument, based on evidence - not fiat.",
      "The proposed bill invites comparisons to George Orwell’s 1984, a novel where governments allow only their functionaries and state sanctioned news media to ‘guide’ the public discourse.",
      "If a government can censor its critics, that’s a license for even greater atrocities. It is the beginning of totalitarianism and once you start censoring, you’re on your way to dystopia and totalitarianism."
