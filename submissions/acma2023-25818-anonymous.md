# Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation

I am strongly objecting to the proposed changes to suppress free speech on Social Media
(or anywhere else). I believe this severely impacts our Human Rights as specified in Article
19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in which it is stated that “Everyone has the
right to freedom of opinion and expression..”.

If ideas cannot be expressed, discussed and shared, human progress and democracy
ceases to exist. Truth cannot exist if there is only one arbitrary source who decides what is
or isn’t misinformation or disinformation.
