Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications


_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)_


The last three years since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared have demonstrated clearly


that our Constitutionally-guaranteed rights to breathe freely, choose what we will and will not


allow in our bodies and even our ability to educate our children or ourselves and be able to


continue working at our careers has been restricted.


Now, the Commonwealth wants to take things a step further and determine what we can and

cannot say or even think by holding the social media platforms accountable for ‘allowing’ us


to have freedom of political speech. Your power must really be tenuous if the only way you


can hold onto it is by suppressing any and all debate.


It’s not as though either the Morrison or the Albanese government has actually gotten


anything right over the entire duration of the so-called pandemic. This is what these


governments were guilty of:


**1.   They promised that the COVID injectables would keep those who took them safe**

**from COVID infection, only to be shown that they were unable to prevent infection in**

**those who took them. Even worse, they were well-aware of this fact at the time the jabs**

**were first provisionally approved and they suppressed this information – even though**


**they knew it was correct.**


**2.   They promised that those who took the COVID jabs would not just protect**

**themselves, but those around them. They vilified informed Australians who wanted**

**evidence of safety before agreeing to be injected, calling them granny-killers and worse,**

**whilst knowing all the while that these jabs had never been tested for their ability to**

**stop transmission. In other words, they lied to the people they were supposed to be**


**serving.**


-----

**3.   They enforced the wearing of masks – even in young children who were**

**psychologically scarred by this action – even though they knew that there was no**


**evidence that masks – even N95 masks – could prevent the spread of a viral illness.**


**4.   They ordered social distancing even though there was not then nor is there now**

**any scientific evidence to show that this action would prevent even one infection or save**


**any lives.**


**5.   They wouldn’t allow people to visit their elderly relatives in nursing homes,**

**enforcing a cruel isolation whereby many people died early and alone. People**

**undergoing treatment in hospital settings had to do so without any support and even**

**children were forcibly separated from loving parents due to their policies of torture in**

**order to cement total control. And tyrannical State Premiers under their watch refused**

**to allow the treatment of innocent Australians, leading to the deaths of babies and**


**young people. Democide at its most obvious.**


**6.   They locked down or allowed lockdowns of entire cities and communities,**

**militarising the police force to beat, abuse and illegally harass Australians who were**

**simply trying to live their lives. Again, there was no evidence that lockdowns would do**

**anything other than destroy lives, businesses and communities. Perhaps that was their**


**ultimate goal?**


**7.   They allowed the unconstitutional closure of State and Territory borders,**

**separating families further, keeping people from their employment and stopping**


**commerce and communication despite the lack of infections in Australia at that time.**


**8.   They forced healthy people to undergo a medical procedure, using a PCR test that**

**was incapable of diagnosing an infection, run at a cycle threshold so high, it was**


**guaranteed to show false positives in people without any symptoms.**


Why am I raising these issues with you when you may feel they have nothing to do with the


proposed legislation?


The only reason why these governments were able to get away for so long with these actions

was because the legacy media was totally complicit. They suppressed alternative viewpoints

completely; they used some of the most egregious hate speech to describe those who simply


wanted to make informed health choices; they ignored or berated those who had been harmed


by these jabs and they refused to report the scientific papers published in the peer-reviewed


-----

literature demonstrating what the Government already knew – that these jabs were ineffective


at preventing infection or transmission and were causing permanent injuries and deaths in


unprecedented numbers of Australians, young and old.


The other side of this issue was only available on social media and in the alternative


broadcast media. This might not have posed such a problem for the authorities if it weren’t


for the fact that more and more people were ignoring the mainstream and availing themselves


of the data being reported by non-Government-approved sources.


Democracy dies in darkness and apparently, ACMA by obeying those who would use their


power to silence our voices, would be conspiring with vested interests to keep Australia in


permanent night.


Australia already has laws in place to protect people from hate speech or threats.


ACMA should not be the arbiter of what is mis or dis-information – especially when, as


demonstrated above, the Government has been the leading purveyor of both.


**The answer to scientific or political controversies isn’t more censorship – it’s more**


**debate**


So we absolutely oppose any laws which would empower ACMA or any other Australian


body to restrict in any way our right to communicate freely and openly on any issue


whatsoever.


Kind regards,
