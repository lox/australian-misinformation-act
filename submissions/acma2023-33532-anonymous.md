##### To whom it may concern:

 Dear Officer,

 I write to express my extreme concern at the proposed bill is undemocratic, it
###### is badly drafted with poorly-defined key terms, and in direct contravention of
##### the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory.

## The Bill is against Democracy and Free Speech

##### The Fact Sheet on the draft bill states that "Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy". You provide NO evidence to support this claim.

 The government already has the means to take actions on genuine threats to national security, on fraud, and on speech which incites violence.

## Key terms are poorly defined

##### At no point in your lengthy discussion of these rules and codes does the Bill make clear WHO will be responsible for determining what constitutes mis- and disinformation, and HOW this determination will be made. It is already unacceptable, if not treasonous that the government is seeking to regulate the speech of Australians; the fact that this regulation will be enforced using a completely non-transparent process should raise concerns of all Australians.

## The Bill contravenes multiple articles of a key human rights
# treaty

##### Article 19 of the ICCPR enshrines the following rights: "the right to hold opinions without interference" and "the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas
#### of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the
##### form of art, or through any other media of his choice".

 The draft Bill directly contravenes the second of these rights, by seeking to impose restrictions on the types of information that individuals can seek,


-----

##### receive and share, based on poorly defined categories of potential or putative "harm". The attack on the first right is indirect; by policing the information available to Australians, government appears to be covertly seeking to influence, and even control, the opinions we hold.

 In summary, this Bill represents an assault on the pillars of our democracy.

 Kind regards
