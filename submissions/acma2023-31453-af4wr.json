    "Key Arguments": [
      "The omission of sex as a protected category in the definition of harm is problematic, as it fails to address misogyny and its impacts on women.",
      "The terms 'harm' and 'hatred' are conceptually vague, making it difficult to assess and address misinformation and disinformation effectively.",
      "The Bill could potentially limit freedom of information and expression, as it may lead to censorship and the imposition of ideological agendas."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "Misogyny continues to have material impacts on Australian women’s lives—that is, the lives of people of female sex.",
      "What is needed is a much broader ranging and more in-depth culture change, and it is not certain that immediate censorship of all sexist remarks will get that job done effectively.",
      "There is a real risk that efforts to combat online misinformation and disinformation by foreign actors could be used to legitimise attempts to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce ideological conformity in Australia."
