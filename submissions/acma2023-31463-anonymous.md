**Submission to Exposure Draft**

**“Communications Legislation Amendment**

**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

**August 16, 2023.**

My submission is presented in 6 parts:

Part 1. Introduction.

Part 2. General Commentary on the underlying premises of the Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation Bill 2023.

Part 3. Who decides what the truth is? And how is the report card going so far, since January 2020?

Part 4. Passing the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 would contravene criminal laws, The
Geneva Convention, Nuremberg Code, and therefore be a criminal act.

Part 5. Who is governing Australia, and how do these bills see the light of day?

Part 6. Summary

_Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, doctor, censorship expert, etc. It is my right, however, to speak freely_
_and openly about this Exposure Draft to the Bill. I take no responsibility for what might be seen as_
_conjecture, falsity, opinion, etc. I am participating with my opinions as a living woman, presently_
_residing in Australia._

**PART 1 – INTRODUCTION.**

My first perusal of the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation Bill was one of disbelief.

Of immediate concern was the “excluded content for misinformation purposes” (page 5, lines 11 –
32, and page 6 lines 1 and 2) which includes

(b) professional news content;

(c) content produced by and for an educational institution; (c) content produced by and for
an educational institution accredited by any of the following: (i) the Commonwealth; (ii) a
State; (iii) a Territory; (iv) a body recognized by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as
an accreditor of educational institutions;

….
**(e) content that is authorized by: (i) the Commonwealth; or (ii) a State; or (iii) a Territory;**
**or (iv) a local government.**

No, you really could not make this stuff up!

So now a purveyor of the truth: anything the government says, and all media paid by the
**_government to say things – sounds like the definition of totalitarianism to me. Prove me wrong._**

As a consequence of this early reaction to The Bill, which I believe is illegal if passed, I will not be
making a detailed submission as there must be a queue of lawyers lining up to push back on these
unprecedented clauses and amendments to the present laws.

When did the Australian Government become so corrupt that it was up to the citizens to make
submissions to ensure that politicians and public servants making the laws are not enshrining into
law such things as “free speech is now a criminal act”?

Since the day that citizens have to raise Freedom of Information requests, ask for senate enquiries,
wait for the court cases, advocate for Royal Commissions (with dubious results), look internationally
for answers on what the Australian governments are hiding from us, their international globalist
“partners”, compromised “stakeholders, etc.?

At the same time being the victim of government collusion with “fact checking” organizations, that
have now been proven to be dumb, _incorrect and culpable._

In this submission I will refer to the “Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and the “Misinformation and
_Disinformation Bill”, or just “The Bill” for ease of submission._

**PART 2 – GENERAL COMMENTARY ON THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MISINFORATION**
**AND DISINFORMATION BILL.**

The obvious underlying assumptions of this bill is that:

a) there is “Truth”, but “truth as defined by the government, and whoever else is deemed to be

telling the truth within the structure of this new bill/act”,

b) the fact checkers always get it right,
c) governments are not corrupt, no-one in government is ever compromised, our politicians

always tell the truth, lobbyists have no power in this country,

d) the most recent criminal behaviours of all levels of government in Australia and overseas,

including global organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), did not exist as
criminal behaviours. “Nothing to see here”, for the last 3 years, as hundreds of thousands
die, and millions are harmed.

There must be a mistake, perhaps this bill did not slip through parliament fast enough, like may
others (unnoticed), and the timing became all wrong.

At this stage of the game, we KNOW the factcheckers were a joke, that there has been is
international and national criminal activities being conducted by all levels of government and by
international organizations that Australia is signed up to, and continues to be signed up to, such as
the World Health Organization.

In spite of the best efforts to silence the intelligent, intuitive and ethical members of the Australian
public and overseas citizens, the truth is out… and the truth as we know it, not the truth as the fact
checkers, corrupt government officials, corrupt politicians and paid media would have us believe.

Here are a few examples of the biggest lies we have seen over the last 3 years, now proven to be lies,
and the subject of many court cases, and the best ones are yet to come:

1. The “COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective”.
2. “The science is in”. That new definition of science is the antithesis of science. The science is

NEVER in. That’s what science is… the continuing question.

3. Masks prevent transmission.
4. “Vaccines” stop the spread.
5. The “Vaccines” were vaccines. The latest information from the United State law cases and

investigations into the contracts made between and the Department of Defense is that

they are “countermeasures” and that the operation conducted was under “demonstration”.

6. That Australia actually had a “Pandemic”, and not just merely following the directives of the

World Health Organization and other parties, including international vested interests. We now
know the majority of deaths have occurred after the rollout of the “vaccines” – demonstrated by
the recent release of the Western Australian figures, now featured in international news – but
strangely NOT in Australia.

7. That “the real news”, necessarily moved over to alternate media channels – such as Bitchute,

Telegram, Signal, dedicated websites servers, Substack, Rumble, etc. is labelled “conspiracy
theorist misinformation”. (Anything that might save your life?)

8. “PCR tests ae effective for detecting COVID-19”. And at the cycles they were using in Australia!
9. “Hydroxychloroquine is not effective and should not be used.”
10. “Ivermectin is a horse past and not suitable.”
11. “Emergency Use Authorization” declaration – was only a possibility because they outlawed all

_alternatives to the upcoming “vaccine”, (e.g. Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin). A “technical_
play”, on the part of our medical and political officials, in collaboration with unelected
compromized international bodies such as the WHO.

12. “Two weeks to flatten the curve.”
13. “Died suddenly” is a cause of death.
14. “Ask your doctor” – hmmm, no.
15. The government will “Build Back Better” – straight out of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s)

copybook. Nothing to see there.

**_Minister for Communications (Australia)_**

I notice the scope of Michelle Rowland’s portfolio includes: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
Australian Communications and Media Authority, Australia Post, Australian Classified Board, National
Library of Australia, NBN Co and Special Broadcasting Services.

“In the Government of Australia, the ministers administer the portfolio through the Department of
Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts.” (Source: Wikipedia
August 2023.)

_Quite a lot of room to move, if and when this bill is passed!_

**_How is the “2 weeks to flatten the curve” going?_**

And I notice STILL, that pale blue COVID-19 box under certain videos on YouTube etc, from the Covid19 “factcheckers” that are still calling scientific discoveries and recent revelations as
“misinformation”, and these behaviours are condoned by the Australian Government, which is now
putting this bill through parliament.

No, you could not make this up.

**PART 3 – WHO DECIDES WHAT IS THE “TRUTH”? AND HOW IS THE REPORT CARD GOING SO FAR,**
**SINCE JANUARY 2020?**

Page 3 of 8


-----

Something is seriously wrong here.

Here are some anomalies that no-one wants to talk about. STILL. And we are over 3 years in…

- “Died Suddenly” is a legitimate cause of death. Since when? That does not seem to be called
misinformation or disinformation, and does not get factchecked.

- Why were “vaccines” taken off the market? We did not hear about that. Was that

something that we were not supposed to know about? Was that piece of information censored
without our knowledge? What else could we put into that classification?

- Why is the development of mRNA vaccines continuing, with more production facilities in
Australia, including for the potential rollout to animals?

- The actuarial anomalies that show a marked rise in death and disability since the introduction of
the “vaccines”,

- There is a definite link between the rollout in the US with the Department of Defense. Has
Australia’s TGA been given instructions from somewhere else? Or wasn’t the TGA actually part of
the “approval process”, just like we are finding out about the FDA in the US.

- Why is it that our hospitals are seeing greater numbers of myocarditis and pericarditis, and why
have there been the greatest number of defibrillator machines rolled out across the country?

- Why hasn’t the full list of been published in the Australian

media? The TGA’s website? The AMA’s website? AHPRA’s website? This list became available in
**April 2021 after** failed. (Available through

Childrens’ Health Defense’s US website.)

- How about the increase in miscarriages and menstrual cycle problems? Is infertility a side effect?
Where was the testing on pregnant women that proved the claims of “safe and effective”?

- Who is paying this bill? Never before in the history of this country has so much funding been
passed over to the medical industrial complex, the defence department, the media promotions.
And for what result?

- Given what we know now “informed consent” was never given. A breach of the Nuremberg
Code.

- Why isn’t Australia’s main stream media covering the stories that are all over alternate media?
Droves of citizens have moved away from compromised main stream media because they are not
covering the real news. Which is probably exactly why this corrupt bill is being considered,
because too many people now actually know what has been happening.

The Dutch court case announced August 2023 covering COVID-19: The Great Reset.

**Brook Jackson vs US Department of Defense relating to “countermeasures” and**
“demonstration”, rather than what we/they thought/assumed were the processes that brought
the to “market”. Not clinical trials, not FDA approval, not informed consent.

This pandemic debacle has been so drawn out that many experts have had the time to write and
publish books. Including Edward Dowd, Dr. Peter McCollough, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr Vernon
Coleman, Prof. Mattheus Desmet, and many others.

This cat is not going back into the bag, no matter how hard the Australian Government tries.

For the people who know the truth it is beyond pathetic and laughable, if it wasn’t so deadly serious.

No amount of effort to cover this up will actually work. It will work to confirm what we know.

Furthermore, we are aware of what is coming down the pipeline, and of course, all these new ideas
would be subject to the misinformation and disinformation restrictions on “truth”:

. CBDC – find it on the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Website. Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. Digital ID – find it on the Australian Government Digital Transformation Agency website.
https://dta.gov.au. Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. The doing away with cash. Go to your bank and try to withdraw a significant amount of your own
**money. Try depositing a significant amount of cash into your bank account. What questions are you**
getting? Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. Look up YouTube videos of the head of the Bank of International Settlements stating that EVERY
TRANSACTION will be trackable and traceable. Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. Look up the latest figures on increased deaths following the vaccine rollouts around the world. Ed
Dowd’s book “Cause Unknown – The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022” is a good one. If
it is NOT the vaccine, then what is it? (We don’t seem to have any expert medical professionals
solving this question for us. They are all VERY quiet.) Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. SMART Cities. Declared by Dominic Perrottet in Australia on main stream media, and developing all
around the world from Oxford to who knows where, too many to keep up with. Truth. Not a
conspiracy.

. Surveillance cameras popping up everywhere. If you can’t see them, then you’re not looking. All for
your “safety and convenience”. Yeah, right. Truth. Not a conspiracy.

. Today I discovered “SMART vocabulary”, at Cambridge University. Truth. Not a conspiracy. Will it
ever end?

. Mobile phones doing a bit more than you thought they were? Tracking and tracing, blue-toothing,
etc. Do you need to turn on audio, turn on Bluetooth to access nearby devices; in order to take a
PHOTO! Notice all the new permissions that are “given” every time that you update your phone?
Truth. Not a conspiracy.

The encroachment of public review into personal lives is unacceptable.

By the way, this bill covers all digital devices right down to your own phone… Truth. Not a conspiracy.

Who decides what is the truth? The government? The compromised Therapeutic Goods
Administration? The compromised Military? The compromised Medical Industrial Complex? The
propaganda division of the government? My local council? The proven-to-be-dodgy factcheckers – or
didn’t that get shown on television?

_If it is not on main stream media, it is not a fact?_

**PART 4 – PASSING THE MISINFORMATION AND DISINFOMATION BILL WOULD CONTRAVENE**
**CRIMINAL LAWS, THE NUREMBERG CODE, THE GENEVA CONVENTION, AND THEREFORE BE A**
**CRIMINAL ACT.**

_So, let’s have a look at the rights of Australian men and women._

We have the right to free speech, good health, freedom of movement, freedom to travel, freedom to
mix with whoever we want, freedom of speech, and many other rights of free men and women.

Page 5 of 8

_International laws, conventions, codes and criminal laws enshrine Australian’s right to free speech._

**Australian Criminal Code Act 1995. Australian Legislature.**

I’m not a lawyer, but it would appear to me that the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill, if passed
into law would contravene the Australian Criminal Code Act 1995.

Censoring information and actively preventing the truth about harmful activities and mandated
_injections from the Australian public would constitute the following:_

A. The Criminal Code Schedule Chapter 8, Division 268, Subdivision C:

268.8 Crime against humanity – murder
268.9 Crime against humanity – extermination
268.10 Crime against humanity – enslavement
268.12 Crime against humanity – imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty
268.20 Crime against humanity – persecution
268.23 Crime against humanity – other inhumane act, e.g. (c) the perpetrator’s conduct is
committed intentionally or knowingly as part of a widespread of systematic attack directed
against a civilian population. Penalty imprisonment for 25 years.

As above, Subdivision D:

268.27 Warcrime – biological experiments

268.30 Warcrime – compelling service in hostile forces

One “truth” that we have not seen accepted by the Australian Government publicly, nor the US
Government publicly - and not by the TGA, and not in any statement I have seen in Australia is:

_the “vaccine” incorrectly labelled, is actually a “countermeasure” described under contract_
_between_ _and US Department of Defense, and now known, in the public domain via_

_whistleblower Brook Jackson, see Brook Jackson vs US Department of Defense USA._

_Is this the truth, a version of the truth, or only a truth if the case against the US Department_
_of Defense is “won”? And what is the chance of that win in the courts? Is that thought one_
_that only a conspiracy theorist could have?_

Criminal Code, Chapter 5, The Security of the Commonwealth?

Part 5.1 – Treason and related offences, Division 80. Treason, urging violence and advocating
terrorism or genocide? What if we find out, after more investigations into the biological
“countermeasures”, that these experimental biological substances were rolled out to the
Australian population as part of a “demonstration”, falling in line with a potential foreign agent,
being bodies such as the World Health Organization and other colluding bodies, international
stakeholders, criminal enterprises, unelected foreign bodies, suppliers and government and nongovernment institutions?

_I will not continue here, what did the criminal lawyers YOU consulted say about this bill?_

Australian Criminal Code Act, Division 92

Looking at this division, I could see problems relating to foreign interference in relation to
influencing the exercise of an Australian democratic or political right or duty, being covert or
deceptive, etc. A person acting on behalf of a foreign principal, etc. All criminal offences.

The criminality of the last 3 years, in particular, have been very obvious. This needs to be fully
revealed, and any attempt at censorship would be part of that criminality.

B. Nuremberg Code. The Right and obligation to Informed Consent.
C. Geneva Convention. Bioweapons are outlawed in the Geneva Convention, punishable by

hanging.

D. Australia has no Bill of Rights. We need one immediately.

**_When Australian citizens_**

**_see an unlawful/criminal act being perpetrated on citizens,_**

**_causing harm, injury and death,_**

**_we have an OBLIGATION to speak out,_**

**_or we could be considered part of the criminal act._**

**PART 5 – WHO IS GOVERNING AUSTRALIA, AND HOW DO THESE BILLS SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY?**

For this bill to be considered it has been through many hands and many government officials.
Including acting members of the Federal Parliament!

_AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND OUR TIME CHECKING AND REPORTING ON THE NEW_
_CRIMINAL, FRAUDULENT AND TREASONOUS BILLS BEING CONSIDERED BY OUR GOVERNMENT!!_

What happened to Australia that a citizen is required to make a submission to government on a bill
that should not have even been put together and brought to parliament?

What has happened to this country that the politicians, executive branch, public servants have
become so out of touch that a bill such as this is even considered suitable to comment on?

We have experienced the complete decimation of businesses, the creation of the largest national
debt in the history of Australia, people are harmed and dying, and these are just the start of the
problems!

We will not comply. If you do not say “NO” you are aiding and abetting a criminal organization.

This is completely staggering, and proof that our government has been compromised at all levels.

Frankly I’ve got better things to do than spend days reading papers like these that government
employees should be quite capable of binning before they see the light of day.

But to be accepted into parliament as a bill is a nightmare!

Proof that things are very bad in our parliaments. VERY bad.

**PART 6 – SUMMARY**

Page 7 of 8


-----

I do not support this bill, nor any part of it.

If this bill is passed in parliament, it will turn our country into a totalitarian government.

_The timing of this bill is also of great concern, because the “big game” has not really been rolled out_
yet… the about to be sealed IHR agreement with the WHO, the digital identity, all matters of great
concern to the well informed, who do have an opinion, and have every right to express it.

Furthermore, this bill, in conjunction with the digital identity, CBDC, unelected globalist agendas,
digital surveillance of Australian citizens, will bring about a dystopian future which Australians do
NOT want to participate in.

It could be part of the social credit scoring system, which I refuse to participate in.

I believe it to be a criminal act to sign this bill into legislature, harming and enslaving Australians.

I say “NO”.
