Subject: Misinformation & Disinformation Proposed Law
To: <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>

This is my formal submission re the above proposed law. I agree that my submission can be publicised with my identity...
My submission is below..

I wish to register my completely horrified OBJECTION to the current Australian Labor government's proposal for this law,
which unbelievably proposes to EXCLUDE THEMSELVES but limits freedom of speech for EVERY other Australian.
The decision re what actually constitutes misinformation or disinformation, planned to be determined by a selected group of
individuals, is the mechanism straight out of Communist China and will result in this government being recognised as
COMMUNIST and subsequently losing office.
Australians will not condone any government which removes ITSELF from danger of liability while it puts every Australian
citizen under that same liability.
