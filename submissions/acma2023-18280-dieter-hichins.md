Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I oppose this proposed bill.

This bill cannot be described as anything less than a vehicle or tool to destroy free speech. The one
thing COVID taught society is that the government and mainstream media is fallible and under the
control of nefarious external agencies such as Big Pharma, the WHO, the UN, and the WEF. The
term's "Misinformation and Disinformation" are simply synonyms for "saying anything that which
opposes the current governments or mega wealthy oligarch's, desired narrative".

As can now clearly be seen, the rushed into existence, COVID Injectables, were neither “safe” nor
“effective”. Their use has caused untold deaths worldwide. Probably more than the alleged disease it
was supposed to combat", and millions of injuries with the total effects yet to be felt.

Furthermore, the injectables not only failed to protect people from contracting COVID, but resulted
in almost every person who received one or more shots, to actually contract the disease.

This cannot be denied as government now has a COVID Injectable compensation scheme.

The world is yet to truly explore and reveal the massive rise in unexplained and sudden deaths.

It is true to say that all levels of government are now guilty of Misinformation and Disinformation.

To add absolute insult to injury, the government also took active steps to suppress medical
professionals from coming out and speaking the ACTUAL truth that the COVID injectable and the
standard hospital treatment process were killing people.

History shows that great people, deep thinkers, have been persecuted for their opposing thoughts or
beliefs. When Galileo’s proposed that the sun didn’t revolve around the earth and that in fact the
earth spun on its axis, the church threatened him with torture and if he didn’t recant his beliefs.

Charles Darwin was branded a Heretic for suggesting the concept of Evolution.

Adolph Hitler was of the opinion that anyone not of the perfect Blond Haired, Blue Eyed Aryan race
must be destroyed. Thankfully that dictator never lived to see his wish come true, but not before
killing countless millions in an unnecessary World War. In his Book Mine Kampf he quoted the media
as being the bringers of evil dissent against his magnificent work.

The list is endless.

For Science to work, it must have opposing views to then prove as fact any given new concept or
idea. To label one man’s ideas as Misinformation and Disinformation is to do a disservice to any
logical thinker.

Man’s right to free speech must be maintained. No person, body, organisation, or government, has
the right to prevent totally free discourse of thoughts or knowledge.

This Bill is an attack on free speech, and must be treated with nothing less than utter contempt.

Yours

Dieter Hitchins
