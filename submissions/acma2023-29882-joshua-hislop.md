Firstly, I do not consent to the modification of the text of this submission in any way.
The Digital Service Standard guidelines (particularly pertaining to “inclusive
language” and “literacy standards”), linked on the ‘have your say’ submission page,
are already dystopian and ridiculous stipulations to make on the public and our own
communication with each other. A government may have a style guide it issues
internally for its own communication but to foist this same requirement on the public
is arbitrary and I do not take the threat of government censorship lightly.

Now to the content of this particular legislation: we find in the Definitions that
misinformation is defined in such a way that a government body will find something
to be “false, misleading or deceptive”. To consider what a government censor in the
course of their daily work might find ‘deceptive’ or ‘misleading’ is a sinister enough
notion to consider. The definition does put some more qualification on this statement:
that the provision of such content is reasonably likely to contribute to serious harm.
Statements of ‘reasonable likelihood’ are language for courtrooms, and whoever may
be flagging content as ‘misleading’ is highly unlikely to make a reliable determination
of which content may somehow lead to harm. Furthermore, digital platforms wishing
to err on the side of caution will be forced to determine all content reported as
potentially misleading or potentially deceptive as potentially harmful due to the
volume of content generated on these platforms being beyond comprehension.

I can certainly think of several instances where a news report or speech by a
government figure was potentially misleading, deceptive and potentially seriously
harmful. Will these entities be held to the same standard of accountability under this
draconian censorship bill? No, they are creating “excluded content for misinformation
purposes”, along with the ever-nebulous ‘free use’ clause relating to parody and
humour, and the educational institutions. I would have thought that these particular
entities carry more weight behind their statements and as such should be held to a
higher level of scrutiny rather than protected from accountability. Might I suggest that
these entities have something to gain in an underhanded manner from censoring the
public? Or that some people in these institutions believe themselves above the law,
and thus the digital platforms should be forced to present their words as truth above
all else? We already had the Australian media conglomerates attempt to force social
media companies to present their content in such a manner, and pay them for the
privilege. Dare I suggest that in 2020 and 2021 large swathes of the government
also forced their often incorrect statements to be presented as truth on these
platforms?

Public trust in government and established media is at an all-time low and falling. I
can see this legislation as nothing other than an attempted power-grab. Censorship
always does the bidding of evil, and this legislation will be no exception. Under the
guise of preventing harm, this bill violates.
