Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

To Whom It May Concern:

I vehemently oppose this proposed act in its entirety and the proposed legislation in its current form.
It’s very flimsy. This Bill has so many holes I don’t know where to begin.

In a free democracy, dissent is what checks and balances corrupt totalitarian overreach by those
entrusted with powers of governance. Of this there can be no dispute unless the current political
regime in Canberra is only giving lip service to democratic ideals.

⚫ Is the government and educational institutions, and the news agencies that serve them, being

given a pass against causing harm or severe harm against a man or woman or Australian person
by spreading misinformation or disinformation (and by preventing people from being fully
informed by information that contravenes the ‘official narrative’ propaganda)? It seems so as
this Bill is currently written. This act violates fully informed consent. International law of
which Australia is a party and is superior law requires every man and woman be allowed fully
informed consent on any matter. This omission is going to invite endless legal challenges.

⚫ **A TRUE Bill would aim to stop ALL misinformation or disinformation IRRESPECTIVE**

**OF SOURCE that causes or poses to cause harm or serious harm to any man or woman**
**living in Australia.**

The Orwellian nature of this act will have the government lying to uphold multinational corporate
interests. When that narrative is challenged with true science citing factual evidence by independent
whistle-blowers to refute these lies (and the digital platforms that support them) it is deemed
misinformation and disinformation as we witnessed worldwide over the last three years. And now you
want to make a law to stop any form of interference for authoritative rebuttal by world leading doctors,
researchers, scientists, etc. to name but a few. In a free society we all have a right to rebut the official
narrative, especially if it is a big lie being paid for by multinational corporate interests to be sold to the
public through the government agencies and educational bodies, etc.

Call this the ‘Ivermectin syndrome’ where a long-proven safe and effective alternative got vilified
because it threatened the agenda of the Big Pharma Covid jab narrative; since demonstrated by the
Australian government’s own statistics and admission as not being either effective or safe. There is
nothing fair and balanced here. A democracy has all views on offer and an INFORMED individual is
free to make their own independent choice. It is not up to ACMA to play big brother.

You are taking away democracy, not upholding it. This Bill is an obvious totalitarian power grab to
quell the Australian democratic right to free speech, even though it tries to play this fact down. It is all
over the draft legislation you’ve put forth.

⚫ Along with parody, satire, etc., opinion is also protected free speech even if blatant

disinformation, thus if labeled so is also to be exempt from this legislation and needs to be
**clearly included in section 2.1.4.**

⚫ And every man or woman maintains every right to not self-incriminate and that cannot be

legislated away. Clause 21 needs to be removed in its entirety.


-----

⚫ **How is intent known by this Bill? What is the objective test for it (there are no provisions for**

this in the draft legislation)? Currently it is just left up to the bias of those at ACMA who need
to maintain control over the official narrative.

⚫ The Australian corporation has no jurisdiction over non-persons or anyone or anything not

domiciled in the legal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Australia, thus any digital platforms
there will simply move if this becomes a problem for them. Your jurisdiction is a very narrow
slice and the internet is a very big place. So if your agenda is to silence dissent to the
WHO/government narrative it will be proven out you really have no teeth with this legislation
anyway.

It is true that no one wants to be purposely deceived or misled, by individuals or institutions alike. And
because of what has happened over the last three years trust in government and the news media is at an
all time low as more people are being woken up to the deception before them.

Sincerely,

George Smith
