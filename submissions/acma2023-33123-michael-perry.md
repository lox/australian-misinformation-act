# Submission regarding the - "Communications Legislation Amendment
 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023"

 I am opposed to this bill as it is an attack on Australian democracy and way of life.

 Democracy depends on the free flow of ideas and healthy debate in whatever form that should take. Current laws adequately cover such matters as slander, terrorism incitement to violence and the like.

 It is appalling that social media is targeted under this bill while the government and its departments as well as education and main stream media are exempt. Surely the last few years have shown this to be a dangerous situation when the government and main stream media have not always been correct in the information issued to the public. Qu3estions raised on social media during this period have later been vindicated.

 To stifle debate is a retrograde action in any society where opposing ideas need to be discussed and debated in seeking to arrive at a correct conclusion.

 The public must have access and opportunity to be presented with all sides of an issue and not just be given the conclusion that ACMA has decided, and dictates to be the truth.

 ACMA as an unelected bureaucratic body can easily be wrong and also easily corrupted by vested interests. This gives blatant opportunity for ACMA, government and main stream media to spread false propaganda while stifling healthy debate from the public through social media and independent journalists.

 This bill is not democracy, this is the path to totalitarianism.
