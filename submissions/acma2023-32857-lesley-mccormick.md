EXPOSURE DRAFT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT
(COMBATTING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION) BILL 2023

Very few Australian residents have legal qualifications, and consequently do not understand
the possibility that they may contravene some new law that they are unaware of – it is
proposed that Australian citizens will be required to comply, but this will not apply to other
people living in Australia and will not apply to Govt (State and Federal). I don’t have legal
qualifications and personally I am struggling to understand the numerous provisions in this
proposed Bill. I assume that businesses etc would have to employ the services of a solicitor to
determine if they will contravene any provisions.

It seems to me that the proposed bill is wide and far reaching, but it does not explain in plain
English exactly what is meant. A submission by the Victorian Bar has raised issues that are
not obvious when examining the proposed Bill. It seems that the proposed Bill and the Bar’s
submission appear to be dealing with two totally different matters. The average member of
the public (and probable many politicians) would have no chance of understanding what the
proposed Bill truly involves and its far reaching implications.

Consequently, it seems that the proposal for a Bill to combat misinformation and
disinformation is an attempt to limit free speech and regulate what can be said by Australian
citizens/businesses on digital platforms. If this Bill is necessary legislation, then it should
apply to every person living in Australia, all businesses, and to all Government bodies (local,
state, and federal).

If Governments and some others (including overseas digital platforms and Non Australian
citizens/residents) are excluded from the provisions of the proposed bill, in my opinion it is
not only blatantly unfair and unreasonable but akin to a “dictatorship”. Is 1984 is alive and
well in the minds of those who created and proposed this bill? The time and money that has
been wasted on this project could be better used in looking after Australian citizens – we have
plenty of longstanding problems (e.g. health, education, and housing, that need to be quickly
resolved).

If the proposers of this bill are so concerned about misinformation and disinformation, they
should be questioned as to why they have excluded Govt and certain others. In a democracy,
everyone should be treated equally and given the right to express their opinions. Just ask the
aged, the young, families, disadvantaged, and those with disabilities, who are struggling with
financial and health issues and those who are surviving by couch surfing, living in tents, their
cars, or on the streets, and the forgotten victims of the bush fires in NSW and Victoria, who
still don’t have proper housing. Surely Australian citizens such as these, (who are struggling
to survive on a daily basis and those who should already have been housed months ago)
should be able to make constructive comment when they are competing for housing with
hundreds of thousands of new immigrants (not Australian citizens) in the next few years.

The expression of views, without incitement or violence, is part of a healthy democracy. Is
this proposed Bill an underhanded way of stopping complaints against Govt, by citizens who
feel they have been neglected, forgotten or mistreated? We already have numerous laws and
regulations that many of us don’t even know about. Australians want free speech and the
ability to express their opinions on subjects when they believe that unfair decisions have been
made by business, government and others. The ability to redress these problems is an
important cornerstone of our democracy, otherwise we will become a ‘nanny state’.

Governments can make laws that are unjust and unreasonable and the public is not made
aware of the full implications until years later (e.g. Robodebt). Another example is the
“Australian Consumer Law (ACL) which overrides manufacturers’ warranty. If a product
fails after a year, customers may be told that the warranty has expired, but the law does not
require retailers/manufacturers to alert customers about the Australian Consumer Law which
requires that products have to last for a reasonable period of time (generally 2 years). If the
seller does not have mention this provision, it must be raised by the customer before they can
get the longer warranty. This is a blatant example of misinformation and yet quite legal.
Surely Australians deserve to be treated fairly.

The Bill refers to Australian citizens, but in this day and age how can anyone be assured that
comments, made online or elsewhere, have actually been made by an Australian citizen. Will
this proposed Bill apply only to Australian citizens and how will they be identified? Today
there are a huge number of people living and working in Australia, such as overseas students,
visitors, tourists, consular staff, migrants (legal, illegal, or ghost), various holiday workers
and other visa holders. As all these people are not Australian citizens, presumably there will
be no penalties or any repercussion if they cause mischief etc - misinformation and
disinformation. Consequently the proposed bill will discriminate against Australian citizens,
but allow free rein to everyone else and government.

The emerging use of AI – Artificial Intelligence – is another potential problem to consider. Is
an article produced by AI within the legislation? Complaints are already being registered that
AI articles have included misinformation - who will the Govt penalise in this case?

Whether or not we like it, the world wide web has created opportunities for people with a
variety of positive and negative intentions to post online anonymously. How do you filter out
whether the post has been made by an Australian Citizen or not? You only have to look at
newspaper web sites, newspapers and magazines in Australia and overseas to see the
misinformation that sprouts from their pages. How can the average person determine whether
a website is actually Australian or overseas? The use of VPNs is now commonplace, so it is
possible to post online without knowing the true source. If someone has their identity stolen,
how do they prove their innocence?
