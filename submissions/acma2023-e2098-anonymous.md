I am deeply concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the internet can be used to promote
all kinds of information, some of which is untrue. But the answer is not to make the government the arbiter of truth and to censor
those it disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of bad ideas with an open critique of those bad
ideas is the only way the truth can prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience. Our nation
had it right all along. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it.

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal as I am so aware we have lived in the best country in the world which is why so many people fight
so hard to live here.
Us Aussies love freedom and that is why so many have fought so hard for our country.. Please scrap this proposed bill and allow
Aussies to live in the freedoms they have enjoyed for so many years..We do not want to live under a very divisive. authoritarian
Government at all..
