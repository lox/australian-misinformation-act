**Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Dear Sir,

The proposed bill regarding the above misinformation/Disinformation is both a
dangerous, democratically speaking, and totally unnecessary bill. It is dangerous because
as a democratically free country, people should be able to say what they think about
what is allowed, and what is done or not done. If Australia starts regulating this, it is a
first step down the autocratic road of government control by potential despots.

It is also a totally unnecessary approach. Australia is a country of educated people. It is a
country where information is currently freely available, therefore if disinformation or
misinformation is published on any public media it is not difficult to ascertain the truth or
false hood of this information.

Then on top of this to have the government, as the controller of what is misinformation or
disinformation is absolutely laughable. It is the political arena and governments that seems
to put a more disinformation and misinformation out than any other body within Australia,
coming from Victoria one just has to look at the Andrews government to see the quantity
of misinformation and disinformation that comes from the government. As well as all this,
current Australian governments seem to be favouring the newer ideologies over and
above the established and proven truth of the Holy Bible. The teaching and importance
of God’s laws is no longer happening in Australian state schools. This can only be
detrimental to our great Australian society. I think we can already see this happening with
the greater increase of lawlessness in the country, as reported daily in the news reports.

Please do not allow this bill to go forward, in the long term it will only be detrimental to
Australia and the people of this nation.

Faithfully, Brian Essery
