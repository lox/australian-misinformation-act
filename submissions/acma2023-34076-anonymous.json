      "The terms 'misinformation', 'disinformation', and 'harm' are subjective and could be misused.",
      "The legislation could suppress public debate and dissent, leading to more fanaticism.",
      "There is a risk of arbitrary enforcement without proper judicial oversight.",

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "This legislation is likely to result in the credibility gap further widening between what the Government and state apparatus communicates to the electorate and what the electorate experiences during their daily lives.",
      "There is inherent danger to democracy applying the terms misinformation, disinformation and harm as the standard to take punitive action against a third party that can in effect suppress opinions of citizens through a proxy.",
      "It seems this whole misinformation agenda is simply an alternative tack to push through a censorship regime that Australia clearly rejected in 2012."
