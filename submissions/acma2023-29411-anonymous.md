I would like to voice my deep concern and opposition to the proposed Combating Misinformation
and Disinformation Bill introduced by the Albanese Government.

One of the key issues I have with this legislation is its potential impact on freedom of speech and
democratic rights in Australia. The prospect of the government having the authority to control the
definition of truth and manipulate information is deeply troubling.

Furthermore, I find it disconcerting that the Bill seems to establish a double standard, imposing
restrictions on online platforms while granting exemptions to the government and mainstream
media. This raises questions about fairness and equality in the dissemination of information.

Another worrisome aspect of the Bill is the extensive power it bestows upon the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to determine what qualifies as "misinformation" or
"disinformation." Such subjective authority may lead to abuses of power and suppress diverse
opinions and healthy public discourse.

Additionally, I am concerned that the Bill could potentially turn tech companies into tools of
government censorship, stifling free speech and hindering the exchange of ideas on online
platforms.

Moreover, I firmly believe that the proposed legislation might pave the way for ideological
conformity, marginalising dissenting voices and impeding the flourishing of independent thought.
This contradicts the essence of a democratic society, which thrives on diversity and the unrestricted
expression of ideas.

Given these reasons, I strongly urge the government to reconsider and withdraw this, Bill. It is crucial
to uphold the fundamental rights of every Australian citizen, in alignment with the principles
outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to freedom of opinion and
expression, including the unimpeded access to information and sharing of ideas, must be preserved
without limitations.

Failure to do so would have severe and adverse consequences for free speech and democracy in
Australia. Therefore, I call upon the Australian government to prioritise transparency and
accountability, fostering an environment where open debate and diverse opinions are cherished and
encouraged. Let us work together to uphold the values that make our society strong and resilient.

I want to express my serious concern and opposition to the proposed Combating Misinformation
and Disinformation Bill introduced by the Albanese Government.

My main concern about this legislation is the potential threat it poses to freedom of speech and
democratic rights in Australia. I am worried that giving the government the authority to define truth
and control information flow could lead to the manipulation of information.

Furthermore, the Bill's restrictions on online platforms while granting exemptions to the government
and mainstream media create a troubling double standard, undermining fairness, and equality
principles.

Another issue I have with the Bill is that it grants the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) the power to decide what qualifies as "misinformation" or "disinformation." This
subjective definition could be abused and may suppress diverse opinions and public debate.

I am also apprehensive about the possibility of tech companies becoming tools for government
censorship under this Bill, which could stifle free speech and hinder the exchange of ideas.

Additionally, I believe the proposed legislation might promote ideological conformity, silencing
dissenting voices and limiting independent thought. This stands against the core values of a
democratic society, which thrive on diversity and freedom of expression.

Therefore, I strongly urge the government to reconsider and withdraw this, Bill. It is essential to
uphold the fundamental rights of every Australian citizen, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. Everyone should have the right to freedom of opinion and expression, without
interference, and the ability to access and share information and ideas through any media without
restrictions.

Any action less than this would have severe implications for free speech and democracy in Australia.
I call upon the Australian government to prioritize transparency, accountability, and foster an
environment that encourages open debate and values diverse opinions.
