Bill 2023 Cannot Pass

There is significant precedence to the legislation of the proposed by Bill 2023.
In Galileo and Copernicus times the scientific consent and approved government narrative was that the
Earth is the centre of the universe with Sun orbiting it. The punishment for disagreement was death.
During Covid crisis the scientific consent and approved government narrative was that taking Covid
vaccine will protect from getting infected with Covid. A few months ago, a cruise ship came to Sydney
with 800 cases of Covid on board. Since all passengers and the whole crew had to be mandatory fully
vaccinated it consisted of undisputable proof that the government lied. With Bill 2023 in place, websites,
social media, and individuals would have been financially penalised for telling the truth that the Covid
vaccines do not protect from getting infected with Covid. There are numerous other examples.

**Bill 2023 cannot pass; it is as nefarious as it is Orwellian.**
