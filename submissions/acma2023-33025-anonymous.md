Re: The exposure draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I vehemently oppose this bill! Stop this bill!

I acknowledge the importance of addressing misinformation and disinformation however I
have grave concerns about this bill.

I oppose that a select few bureaucrats, no matter how “well intentioned” they are, think they
can make “freedom of speech” decisions on behalf of the whole population of Australia.

The audacity, to think these few, could have the power to make a judgement call on what is
misinformation, or what is disinformation,
what is truth, or what is not truth, for another fellow Australian, is wrong.

To subject the general communication of the Australian public:to judgement,
to the possible removal of their public “voice”
and
to further penalise them,
is wrong!!
It is the opposite to Freedom. It opposes our Liberty..
I oppose this bill!

I believe that the proposed legislation, as currently outlined, raises significant abhorrent
issues :
A.  Threats to Freedom of Speech: The Bill, despite its assurances, could potentially
infringe upon the fundamental right to freedom of speech. By granting the Australian
Communications and Media authority (ACMA) powers to enforce codes of practice
and industry standards, there is a risk that legitimate speech and differing viewpoints
will be suppressed. The potential for overreach and unintended consequences cannot
be overlooked.

B. Ambiguous Definitions: The definitions of misinformation and disinformation
provided in the Bill are subjective and open to interpretation. The lack of clear and
precise guidelines could lead to arbitrary decision-making, potentially stifling
legitimate discourse and inhibiting public debate.

C. Potential for Regulatory Overreach: Granting the ACMA the power to gather
information from digital platform providers, and require them to keep certain records,
raises concerns about privacy and data security. The breadth of these powers,
coupled with the lack of clarity on what constitutes “serious harm”, leaves room for
regulatory over-reach and potential abuse of power.

As an example or a Government’s over-reach:- In the USA, July 2023, a Judge
rejected the USA Justice Department’s request to pause order, limiting Biden
administration’s contact with social media companies.
"Although this Preliminary Injunction involves numerous agencies, it is not as broad as
it appears," Doughty wrote. "It only prohibits something the Defendants have no legal
right to do — contacting social media companies for the purpose of urging,


-----

encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner, the removal, deletion,
suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech posted on
social-media platforms."

What guarantee have we got that there won’t be Australian government over-reach
too?

D. Effectiveness and Feasibility: The proposed powers, particularly the code of practice
and industry standard enforcement mechanisms, may not be effective in combating
misinformation and disinformation. The complexities of managing content on digital
platforms, coupled with the constantly evolving nature of online information, make it
challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all approach. Industry-led efforts and selfregulation in collaboration with users and stakeholders, may be more effective in
addressing these challenges.

E. Potential impact on Innovation and Competition: The additional compliance
requirements and potential regulatory burdens imposed on digital platform services
could disproportionately affect smaller platforms and start-ups. This may stifle
innovation and create barriers to entry for new players in the market, limiting
competition and hampering the development of diverse and dynamic digital
platforms.

You were seeking views on the Exposure Draft Bill, particularly –

1. The definitions of misinformation and disinformation.
Take the Australian Government’s own response to censoring Covid-19 posts.

- The Government announced a package of measures to communicate the “safe and
effective” message during the Covid-19 pandemic aimed specifically at the Australian media.
No other treatments, or positive health messages were broadcast, only a one size fits all
approach to sars-cov2.

- The Covid Vaccines ARE recognised as Gene Technologies “in collaboration with biotech
_company Beam Therapeutics, Pfizer scientists are developing mRNA technology as a new_
_approach to gene editing, a form of gene therapy.”_
[Ref: https://www.pfizer.com/news/behind-the-science/unlocking-power-our-bodys-protein-](https://www.pfizer.com/news/behind-the-science/unlocking-power-our-bodys-protein-factory)
[factory](https://www.pfizer.com/news/behind-the-science/unlocking-power-our-bodys-protein-factory)

- You CAN contract Sars Cov2 post “vaccine”

- You CAN transmit Sars Cov2 post “vaccine”

- The said Cov2 vaccines are not safe and not effective.

- Data evidence:- Australia ...The following chart has been created using the figures found in
the OEC database. Figures that have been provided to the OEC by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
It shows excess deaths across Australia by week in 2022 up to week 30 (31st July).


-----

_[Source Data](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676)_
Australia, in 2022, suffered excess deaths on a weekly basis, with the grand total equating to
18,973.

- Pfizer’s own post marketing report shows 1260 deaths and 156K adverse events with 90
days of release to the public.

- Senators voted against an investigation into excess deaths (why?), all data is sourced from
the Australian Government. More interestingly, is how the death rate fell in Australia in 2020
before the said vaccine rollout, then climbed alarmingly in 2021 post vaccination.

Tax Relief: Commercial television and radio broadcasters will receive a 100% rebate

on their Commercial Broadcasting Tax for 12 months.


-----

The rebate will provide the commercial broadcasting sector with $41 million in tax

relief for the use of broadcasting spectrum, backdated to start from 14 February 2020.

Public Interest News Gathering Fund: $50 million Public Interest News Fathering(PING)

programme will support public interest journalism delivered by commercial television,
newspaper and radio businesses in regional Australia. PING is funded with $13.4 million

of new money as well as repurposed unallocated funds from the Government’s Regional and
Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package (RSP JIP).

- Citizens bodily autonomy and informed consent were removed. Australians were informed
by the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, that the said vaccines were not mandatory but clearly
the states were given the task of making them mandatory, make the PM comments
laughable. This was made more obvious with Greg Hunt (former Minister for Health and
Aged Care) stating, “The world is engaged in the largest clinical trial, the largest global
_vaccination trial ever”. Media event date 21 February 2021._

- All items above, at the start of the pandemic could, and have been removed off social
media platforms, at the bequest of Government and are now entirely true. Which begs the
questions, who with the ACMA, decides what truth is and what is not truth.

2. Potential for Regulatory Burden: The proposed legislation places additional regulatory
burdens on digital platform providers. These providers will be tasked with developing and
implementing systems and processes to combat misinformation and disinformation. The cost
of compliance, particularly for smaller platforms, could be substantial and may hinder their
ability to operate effectively. Such burdens could impede innovation and limit the growth of
the digital economy.

3. Efficacy of Self-Regulation: The draft Bill places significant emphasis on industry-led efforts
and self-regulation. While self-regulation can be effective in certain cases, the complex
nature of combating misinformation and disinformation requires a multifaceted approach.
Relying solely on self-regulation may not adequately address the scope and scale of the
problem, necessitating a more comprehensive and collaborate approach involving
government, industry and civil society.
Schedule I / Part1 / Definitions “excluded content for misinformation purposes”
Includes the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory, a local government. As mentioned in item
1, it is apparent that the Government itself was the main source of mis and dis information.

4. Lack of Clarity on Enforcement Mechanisms: The draft Bill provides the ACMA with reserve
powers to act if industry efforts are deemed inadequate. However, there is limited clarity on
the specific enforcement mechanisms that will be employed. Without a clear framework for
enforcement and accountability, there is a risk of inconsistency and uncertainty in how the
legislation will be applied, potentially undermining its intended objectives.

5. Potential Implications for Digital Innovation and Investment: The proposed legislation,

with its regulatory provisions and potential compliance burdens, may have unintended
consequences for digital innovation and investment in Australia. Overly restrictive measures
could deter foreign investment and discourage the development of new digital services within
the country, negatively impacting economic growth and technological advancement.

6. Serious Harm: I need look no further than pornographic and violent materials

available to all children and younger adults with absolutely no Government intervention after
the many years of internet operations. I find it incredible the Government is seeking to the


-----

arbiter of speech when dark and violent themes are freely available to the world s youth over
the internet and o platforms such as Netflix, Stan, etc. We have universities now propagating
transgender studies, critical race theory but Government feels the need to censor people’s
free speech.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the intent behind the proposed legislation, I believe that
further consideration is required to address the concerns outlined above. Balancing the need
to combat misinformation and disinformation with the preservation of freedom of speech,
privacy and innovation is essential. I recommend a thorough review process, taking into
account, diverse stakeholder perspectives and public input to ensure that the final legislation
strikes an appropriate balance to achieve its intended outcomes.

Many people have migrated to Australia, as its seen as a world leader in democracy, and for
the inalienable rights of its citizens. I fear this bill in the wrong hands will censor free speech
and its lack of transparency from the public’s view will erode trust further in its government.

Items of concern –

    - Free speech

    - Who decides what is and is not mis/disinformation?

    - The Government itself is exempt (look at the mistakes made with covid)

    - The Australian Government is outsourcing its public health response to the WHO a

non-government organisation heavily sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

    - Bill and Melinda Gates made billions through Givi and Pfizer during the pandemic.

    - Censorship is a direct attack on freedom and liberty of Australians and only further

centralises power to a few with Government. The power lies with the Australian People, not
the government. The government is to SERVE the PEOPLE.
