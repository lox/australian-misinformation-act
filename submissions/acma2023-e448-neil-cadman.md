The Australian Communications and Media Authority,
Australian Government.

To whom it concerns,
This may be published.

I wish to oppose the proposed laws allegedly for Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation. I say allegedly
because misinformation and disinformation are relative terms. What is true to one person who is deceived is false to another
person who is also deceived. So, the issue becomes what is truth and who determines what is truth. Without defining an
absolute for truth these laws obviously become subject to the philosophy and morals of the day. And it is plain since the
Government is exempted from these laws that it is only the Government’s variable perception of truth that will count.
But the only reference for truth is God. For God is truth. Jesus Christ is truth. And the Holy Spirit is truth.
“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:…” Joh 14:6
“… I (Jesus) will send (the Holy Spirit) unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall testify of me.” Jn 15:26
The Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, therefore God must be “…. a God of truth …” Deu 32:4
“thy word (O God) is truth.” Joh 17:17
So, I agree that all liars in Australia should be exposed. For the liar destroys society. It is right that God casts the liar into hell.
So, the obvious thing that the Australian Government should do is define this law a little better by stating that
Misinformation and Disinformation is anything that contradicts the word of God, which is what God says, “To the law and to
the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” Isa 8:20
Unfortunately, there are many laws enacted in Australia that are contrary to the word of God and that has brought his
judgment upon the land.
1. Anti discrimination laws- Wisdom is demonstrated in the ability to discern and discriminate. God discriminates
between good and evil. The wicked and the just. The fool cannot do so.
2. Sodomy. God says, “Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
abomination. “ Lev 18:22
“If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall
surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.” Lev 20:13
God destroyed Sodom because of immorality, mostly sodomy.
“And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an
ensample unto those that after should live ungodly.” 2Pe 2:6
3. False religions; False religions are any religion or philosophy that contradict the word of God. They come under the
category of idolatry and bring a curse on the land. Some obvious ones are, Roman Catholicism, Islam. Jehovah Witness,
Hindu, Confucianism and Animism.
4. Abortion. This is murder and the failure to put to death the murderer brings a curse upon the land. The Lord says, “If
men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if
any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning
for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.” Ex 21:22-25

Now “the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness. Rom 1:18
God is a just judge and so because all the things above are freely practised in Australia, and your people are being
prevented form publicly speaking about them, Lord withhold the rain on the land as you have said you will do.
