It is my view that this bill poses the utmost threat to freedom of speech and democracy in
Australia.

I thought that it was up to the individual themselves to look for themselves do their own research
and then decide if the information was true for them or not.

This bill does not allow this to occur. A third party in government decides whether the information
is considered "disinformation" or "misinformation "

Throughout history governments and individual politicians come and go, some with a legacy to be
proud of and others in shame due to unethical behaviour.

How many times is what would be considered "Misinformation" or "disinformation" turned out to be
true.

Tp pass this on the pretence it is to protect the people is a lie and would be turning Australia away
from being a Democratic country to a country where the individual is no longer allowed to think for
themselves.

Another word for Communism.

I submit this as a submission

Kind regards

Jeanette Basso-Bondini
