# From the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House website:  The Australian democracy has at its heart, the following core defining values:

  - freedom of election and being elected;

  - freedom of assembly and political participation;

  - freedom of speech, expression and religious belief;

  - rule of law; and

  - other basic human rights.

Please now consider the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19:
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
_without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas_ _through any media and regardless_
_of frontiers.”_

And Article 30: “Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any
right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms
set forth herein.

Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. The proposed “Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation Bill” is in clear violation of our agreement with the UN.

“A federal judge in Lousiana ruled Tuesday that the Biden administration likely violated the First Amendment
by censoring unfavourable views on social media over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, calling the
efforts ‘Orwellian’
U.S. District Court Judge Terry Doughty also issued a sweeping preliminary injunction barring numerous federal
officials and agencies – including Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Health and Human services Secretary Xavier
Becerra, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and all employees of the Justice Department and FBI –
from having any contact with social media firms for the purpose of discouraging or removing First Amendmentprotected speech.” Matt Berg & Josh Gerstein, 4/7/2023

The right in article 19(2) protects freedom of expression in any medium, for example written and oral
communications, the media, public protest, broadcasting, artistic works and commercial advertising.

Australia is a party to seven core international human rights treaties. The right to freedom of opinion and
expression is contained in articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

_Article 19_

_1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference._

_2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and_
_impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form_
_of art, or through any other media of his choice._

_3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and_
_responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided_
_by law and are necessary:_

_(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;_

_(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals._

This proposal gives the sitting government unprecedented power over media and all information therein. To
even contemplate that a small group of government appointed bureaucrats be the arbiters of truth at the
behest of the government is almost beyond comprehension in a so-called democracy.

The inference is that the government is clearly threatened by Australian citizens having the right to receive and
distribute information and the ability to make their own decisions. The danger of government potential to
completely shut down conversation is a scenario only usually seen in dictatorships.

The right to question, to debate and to voice an opinion is the foundation of our democracy. It is not for the
government to decide what information we should or should not be permitted to see, share or discuss. In a
healthy, open society, questions, alternate opinions and debate should be encouraged, not stifled.

This “Draft Exposure” seems to be heavily loaded with “misinformation codes”, re-issue of misinformation
codes, sub clauses, referrals circling back to other sub clauses in typical double speak but nowhere did I see an
actual example of what “Mis” or “Dis” information entails. I saw 60 pages of red tape full of threats, penalties
and punishments. Nowhere did I see a clear requirement for full justification of any censorship action.
“Because the government disagrees” is not justification. Are we to expect the government to be spying on our
personal messages (text and otherwise) now to make sure we express the correct opinions? Before even being
accused or suspected of any criminal activity? Where is the consideration of our rights to personal privacy and
freedom of expression? Are Australians set to live in fear of their private conversations and messages
“morphing” into gaol sentences and massive fines for simply expressing a personal view?

The careful insertion of particular mention of referenda information only being able to be disseminated by
government is a warning signal. It appears all dissenting voices will be silenced.

I also noted mention of “misinformation” and “disinformation” from international sources. How can we even
contemplate preventing people from receiving such information? Is this country to be closed down similar to
North Korea or China where people are not allowed to know what is happening in the rest of the world (unless
of course our government decides to allow it?) I find this quite simply astonishing to say the least.

Notably, it appears the government is exempt from any criticism regarding the dissemination of misinformation
or disinformation. Who ultimately decides? And how can they know at the time that they are 100% correct?
And if they are not, will they be held responsible? Whoever makes a decision to silence another is in peril of
committing some sort of “mis-speak” crime themselves by censoring anything that is later found to be fact. Is
ACMA to be bound to provide proof that any so-called mis/disinformation is actually untrue? Is there
somebody who will sign off on this and take full responsibility for their actions going forward in the event that
their censorship turns out to be way off the mark?

There is plenty of rubbish on social media and I personally do belong to any of the three major social media
platforms but I defend the right of those who do to receive information and express themselves freely, no
matter what their opinion and whether or not I subscribe to it.  I am happy to allow them their opinion and I
should remain free to exercise my right to challenge it via any means if I feel so inclined. I am happy to listen
and prepared to change my views depending on the evidence placed before me. With no evidence I cannot
make any informed decisions, nor am I likely to change my views.

Is the free pass for government to remain uncensored and unchallenged proposed to apply to all politicians
and candidates or just those who do not challenge the government? How can we be represented fairly if we
cannot ask questions and debate what our government “permits” us to see or hear? How can we learn the
truth about anything if the government is in charge of all information? The past 3 years has seen many, many
government examples of what I would call “Misinformation” and “Disinformation” and even downright lies. So
now they wish to take it further and gag everybody who happens to disagree then remain presumably
unaccountable?

What or who are the actual targets of this government appointed “Ministry of Truth”? How can “we the
people” possibly be expected to have any trust in government should this outrageous bill come into effect?

This proposed bill must not be passed if Australia is to continue to call itself a democracy. It is NOT in the
interests of the people.
