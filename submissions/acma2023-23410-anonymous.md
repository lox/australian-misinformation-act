I do not think this bill has any benefit for the public good, of the government going down a path of
censorship in this way. No benefit whatsoever. Please scrap this bill immediately. Conversation,
research and debate has always and should always be the way to counter disinformation in this
country. Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right and even though I agree that some
disinformation can be problematic, the alternative of censorship is much worse. There are plenty of
better ways to counter this.
