This legislation is 100% unacceptable. It turns big tech into censors along biased party and
ideological lines, they will claim "misinformation" to censor important information that Australians
need to know and when that "misinformation" is prove to be correct, they'll shrug their shoulders
and point at the Government's authoritarian laws. The Government will point straight back, claiming
they didn't censor anything and it's 100% on big tech for the censorship. The Government is literally
having their cake and eating it too with this attack on free speech. The modern day guise of "safety"
has again been invoked by the Government to justify this attack on free speech and open debate,
they don't want you talking about topics that expose them, this legislation with stop us from talking
because the things that they don't like being discussed will arbitrarily be deemed "misinformation"
or "disinformation".

Just like this process of expressing disgusting over such an authoritarian attack on free speech, which
the Government claims is being done for our "safety". I have to put all my contact details in so they
can put me on record as a trouble maker who doesn't like the Government. This is by design, we are
under attack by our own Government. This is 100% a waste of time, there is no way the Government
is not going to railroad us with this anti-speech legislation. Even if 99% of people decent, it's still
going to be passed because this sort of control and power over speech isn't just desired by the ALP
led Government, almost every politician desires this sort of power over speech. Where do you think
this leads? It leads to the Government censoring criticism of the Government. What will happen
when something is censored because it's deemed "misinformation", but turns out not to be?
Nothing will happen because no one is ever held accountable for attacks on freedoms. Why else
would the Government want such extreme authoritarian powers? Because there is no consequence
for them when the inevitably abuse it.

What about the media? They don't care, this legislation doesn't target them. They play ball with the
Government. This legislation is to destroy the independent journalist, but that's okay because it's all
in the name of "safety". And the disgusting lies that will follow to "justify" this unjustifiable attack on
free speech. I'm so done with this country, watching Australia's slow march towards
authoritarianism breaks my heart every single day. I can't believe everyone else in this country
simply watches on as they keep losing more and more of their freedoms. I speak up now, knowing it
will achieve NOTHING with bully authoritarians because these years will be the last times I get the
right to say something like this before I'm censored. Not censored by the Government, censored by
big tech because that task has now been outsourced so the Government can wash their hands of
destroying free speech in this country with the use of mass censorship.
