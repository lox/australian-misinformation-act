     Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
      Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023
     Dear Sir/Madam/Whatever Crazy Pronouns You Science-Hating Lunatics Demand Now,
      I'm writing to you to try to express at least a small fraction of the depths of
      my profound disgust for you and your evil attempts at censorship.
     "Misinformation", or as we used to call it, "accidentally being wrong about
      something while talking to your friends" is a basic human right. The most basic
      human right of all. The Orwellian nightmare of a government that spies on
     everything you say to your friends in the public square, to punish you if you
     ever get anything wrong, is horrific. Even if the people enforcing the
      misinformation policy were honest and well-intentioned, which they obviously
      won't be. You are truly sick twisted monstrous people for even considering it.
     "Disinformation", aka lies and grifting, is a real problem. But the people
      pushing this bill are the LAST people I would ever want in charge of it, because
     they are the main perpetrators, by an order of magnitude.
      Have a look at "Table 1: Harms" in your guidance note. Does that look like an
      honest impartial attempt at evaluating harms to you? Or does it look like it was
      written by deranged far-left woke lunatics living in an echo chamber with no
     grasp on reality?
      You literally put "Not being a woke leftist" as the first harm in the list!
      In the real world, white people are the main victims of hate crimes, while
      minorities are the main perpetrators. But thanks to disinformation like the
      disinformation YOU are putting out, white people are being framed and demonised.
      Are you going to crack down on lies about ? HA! What a joke. Lying
      about is your entire ideology.
      Are you even aware what the scientific consensus in psychology is about race and
     IQ, or what the statistics say about race and crime? Go look it up, it will
      shock your sheltered minds that have been fed a non-stop diet of extreme-leftist
     disinformation.
     I noticed you put "gender" in the list. Does that mean you're finally oing to
     institutions where they belong for spreading disinformation? Or does it mean
      you're going to ignore the liars spreading disinformation and arrest anyone who
     tells the truth,
     "Misinformation undermining the impartiality of an Australian electoral
      management body ahead of an election or a referendum" - Seriously?! You're
     literally trying to do the American thing of criminalising people for saying the
      election is rigged. And every election from now on really will be rigged BY THIS
     VERY LAW BANNING YOUR OPPONENTS FROM SPEAKING! When people talk about a rigged
     election, what you are doing RIGHT NOW is what they mean! A free and fair
      election is one in which ALL sides are allowed to speak freely, not just the

     delusional pompous blowhards in the "intellectual" class.
     "Misinformation that caused people to ingest or inject bleach products to treat
      a viral infection" - You're literally spreading the LIE that Trump told people
     to drink bleach. HE NEVER SAID THAT. He asked his scientists to research it,
     that's all. If anyone actually drank bleach, it was because of YOU "fact
      checkers" saying "Trump told people to drink bleach!".
      Trying to stop the spread of medical disinformation would actually be a noble
      cause. Antivaxxers killed a LOT of people with their lies. But it's not going to
     work, because the "authoritative sources" platforms use to determine what is
      medical misinformation always end up being the World Health Organisation. The
      same World Health Organisation that demanded nations open their borders at the
     start of the Covid 19 pandemic and let the virus into our countries! The same
      World Health Organisation that called white people racist for getting a booster
      vaccine. The same World Health Organisation that recently tweeted that we should
     try Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Herbal medicine, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy,
     Traditional Chinese medicine, and Unani medicine.

     (Someone added a "community note", but that note itself was also politically
      correct disinformation blaming white people and pretending there's nothing wrong
      with "traditional medicine" per se.)
      Weird how you didn't include any of the leftist disinformation that is dangerous
     to your health that conservatives complain about.
     I get the impression this bill protects the large media companies, such as the
     ABC, who lie like rugs, while only targetting ordinary people who tell the
     truth.
     It will make Australia a laughing stock internationally.
      All global internet sites will have to make massive changes to their code in
     order to either specifically persecute and dox Australians to our dictatorial
     government or not provide a service to Australians.
     As an extremely intelligent science-loving Autistic person, this bill is going
     to put my life in danger.
                  This bill is almost certainly going to make telling Woke
     lies compulsory and telling the truth illegal. Lying about me and inciting
      violence against me will be made legal, while anyone defending me with the truth
      will be arrested for misinformation (or under existing anti-free-speech laws). I
      can look forward to either being thrown in prison for thought crimes or being
      attacked by leftist paramilitaries like antifa for thought crimes. Having my
      speech policed by people far less intelligent than myself and far less honest
     than myself is not safe.
      The great irony is that Australians like me are some of the only conservatives
      in the world who are pro-vaccination, pro-quarantine, and pro-science. We're the
     only ones who can talk to antivaxxers in a language they understand. But we're
     the ones who will be censored. I spend a lot of time online arguing with
     antivaxxers, but it won't be safe for me to continue being online.

     As for solving the underlying issue of people distrusting official information,
     this bill will have the opposite effect. Everyone will know they live in a
     totalitarian dictatorship with a ministry of truth, and nobody will trust the
     government. Especially once they see people getting arrested for saying things
     that are objectively true.
      I'm sure I missed a lot of problems with the bill (and the motivations behind
     it), so please, get out of your echo chamber and read what people who oppose
     internet censorship think.
      BTW, there are existing laws for dealing with fraud. And presumably laws for
     dealing with people who get others killed through negligence or trickery. Use
     them instead of creating laws against free speech.
      In conclusion, I hope your evil totalitarian dictatorship never goes through and
     the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
     Disinformation) Bill 2023 is rejected outright. Or that your dictatorship is
     overthrown one day and you are all thrown in a small dark prison cell for the
      rest of your lives where you belong.
     Sincerely not yours,
     Carl Kenner
