To ACMA / officer
Re : Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the
Communications Legislation Amendment [Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation] Bill 2023)
I write to express profound concern about the proposed Communications
Legislation Amendment [Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill
2023. The bill's redundancy, lack of clarity in key terms, and potential
violation of human rights raise alarming issues that warrant serious
consideration.
The bill's premise, that misinformation and disinformation threaten
Australians' safety and our democracy, is unsubstantiated. Our existing
legal framework already addresses genuine security threats, fraud, and
incitement to violence.
Moreover, the bill's vague definitions of terms like "misinformation,"
"disinformation," and "serious harm" create ambiguity. Who determines
what constitutes these terms, and how will this determination be made?
Such opacity is concerning and could lead to misuse of power.
The proposed bill also contradicts essential democratic principles.
Liberal democracies value the right to hold and express diverse opinions.
Attempting to regulate speech and information dissemination is a
dangerous departure from these principles, with potential for misuse
against dissenting voices.
Furthermore, the bill's classification of harm lacks clarity. It attempts
to regulate emotions, questions democratic processes' integrity, and
presents ill-defined criteria for harm to health, environment, and
economy. These definitions do not align with existing legislation,
rendering the bill redundant.
This legislation also raises concerns about its conformity with the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The right
to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, including information
sharing, are fundamental rights protected by the ICCPR. The bill's
potential to curtail these rights contradicts our international
commitments.
In conclusion, I urge careful reconsideration of the Communications
Legislation Amendment [Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill
2023. We must uphold our democratic principles, protect citizens' rights,
and ensure transparency in our legislative process.
Sincerely,

```
