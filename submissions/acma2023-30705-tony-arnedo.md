I do not support any legislation that censors free speech. It takes away the power from the people
and gives it to those in control. Those who are not necessarily right or wrong but those who seem fit
to enforce their beliefs upon everyone else who doesn’t quite fall into line.

I thought I was born in a free country, but the last few years have proven that we are only free when
those in power tell us we are. We only have freedom of choice as long as our choices align with their
chosen narrative. And if they are allowed get this sort of legislation through you won’t even be able
to say or read what you believe in without their approval of the material first.
