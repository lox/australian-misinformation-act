# Submission in opposition to the proposed Bill granting new powers to the


# ACMA (Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation Bill 2023


Please find below my submission voicing my complete opposition to the proposed
bill.

The Issue: The basic right of a democratic society is for discussion on every issue
within a country to be explored before any Government policy or social agenda is
implemented. Every side of politics & society in general must have the ability &
platform to put forward any thoughts (even it if is in opposition to the incumbent
Government). For a government to have the power to eradicate any opposing or
inconveniently alternative view to its own has no place in a democratic country such
as Australia. Giving the absolute control to an unelected bureaucratic body (ACMA) to
decide what is “misinformation” or “disinformation” (whatever that means) means that
information valuable to assisting the public in forming their opinion, can be blocked
from any public forum.

In summary, find below dot points highlighting just some of the factors that must see
this bill rejected absolutely.

  - The Bill is a significant overreach by the government.

  - The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and
communication under international human rights instruments like the UN
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights.

  - The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence
speech in the public square without transparency or accountability.

  - The Bill includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which risks it
being weaponised to shut down legitimate speech on pressing social issues.

  - The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers
liable for excessive and onerous policing of legitimate speech.

  - The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime
is hypocritical and inconsistent and will establish an asymmetry that results in
one rule for government and another rule for Australians in what they can say.

  - The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of
digital platforms to provide information and evidence about misinformation
and disinformation that is a worrying breach of privacy.

  - The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight
for misuse of censorship powers.

  - The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing
right to freedom of expression are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar
required in international law for the interference with fundamental rights of
freedom of expression.

  - The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation
codes and standards and for failing to provide evidence requested by ACMA
is excessive and will provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.
