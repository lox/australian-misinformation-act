To whom it may concern,

I am wri�ng to express my sincerest concern over the proposed amendments and augmenta�on of
powers provided to the government body ACMA in rela�on to the dissemina�on of misinforma�on
and disinforma�on.

In my opinion, the proposed capacity to issue fines of up to millions of dollars cons�tutes a drama�c
overreach of government authority. These powers could effec�vely s�fle the capacity of dissen�ng
journalists or media bodies to ques�on the overarching ins�tu�ons of power who are responsible for
defining the terms cri�cal to the manifesta�on of this policy, such as:

    - What cons�tutes misinforma�on? According to whom?

    - What cons�tutes disinforma�on? According to whom?

    - Professional news sources are said to be exempt from these powers, professional
according to whom?

Further to this, the proposed fine structure stands to exact far more severe punishment on smaller,
independent, and low-funded media sources. For such ins�tu�ons or individuals, a fine of up to
$2.75 million is likely to be far more devasta�ng, than a fine of up to 2% of gross turnover for a large
interna�onal corpora�on, even if the 2% amounts to a larger sum.

Due to the sheer size of social media pla�orms, and the quan�ty of informa�on they are processing,
the promulga�on of such a policy will no doubt force “social-media, news-aggregators and podcasts”
to enforce arbitrary standards based on current standing informa�on through machine-learning and
other autonomous technologies. These technologies are not always capable of the necessary nuance
and philosophical insight that may be necessary to discern contrarian but true ideas, wellinten�oned but misguided ideas, and outright malicious ideas.

I understand that the dissemina�on of poor or even malignant informa�on is poten�ally dangerous
in certain circumstances – even life threatening. However, the proposed powers have the capacity of
silencing any and all dissen�ng voices on the arbitrary grounds of ‘misinforma�on’, and this is a far
greater threat to the safety of Australians.

The informa�on and assump�ons within in this le�er are derived from informa�on obtained from
the Australian Broadcas�ng Corpora�on:

Thank you kindly for your �me and considera�on. I am grateful that I s�ll have the opportunity to
speak freely in this country on important ma�ers, a freedom that is being proposed to be weakened.

Regards,
