 Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 In a democratic society, which is what Australia is supposed to be, all citizens should have the right to express themselves freely and also to receive information from all sources, in order to use our own powers of critical thinking. As an Australian citizen, I object to this bill and consider that ample and satisfactory laws against hate speech, incitement to violence, fraud, etc. already exist. This bill should be scrapped.
