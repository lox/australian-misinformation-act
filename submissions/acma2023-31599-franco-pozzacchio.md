Dear Sir/Madam

Re: The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation.

I wish to strongly object to the above Amendment Bill on the following basis –

1 Australia is a democratic country and as such, no Government should have the
ability to restrict freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and, more importantly,
freedom of speech.

2 Australia is party to seven core Human Rights Treaties. The most relevant being
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19,
Freedom of Expression, states –

Article 19(1): “Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without
interference”; and

Article 19(2): “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression. This right
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all
kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art,
or through any other media of choice”.

3 Article 1.1 of the ICCPR: “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By
virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue
their social and cultural development”.

4 The Bill in its current form, if passed, would allow ACMA substantial, unilateral
and discretionary authority to govern all forms of media. This Bill, if passed,
would render Australia’s commitment to freedom of speech, and expression of
opinion null and void and allow prosecution of the individual user and media
platform.

In order to stop Australia from going down the path of Socialism / Communism and Tyranny,
and also to stop the single narrative being applied by government or one or more of its
agencies including aligned corporations, I urge that this proposed Bill be disbanded for the
sake of Australia and future generations.

A statement made recently from Robert F Kennedy, Jr “There is no time in history where the
people who were censoring speech were the good guys”.

Yours faithfully

Franco Pozzacchio
