# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

The proposed legislation is offensive in that it assumes people are not able to
think for themselves. In other words, they don't know the difference between
what is true and what is not true. What is being proposed could just as easily be
called the 'The Government Approved Thinking Act'!

As per Wikipedia's definition, "An enabling act is a piece of legislation by which
_a legislative body grants an entity which depends on it (for authorization_
_or legitimacy) the power to take certain actions". This subsequently allows the_
entity a lot of wiggle room in relation to how it actually operates over time. Who
knows what we will end up with?

Governments the world over have been spreading disinformation. Think
propaganda - e.g... 'Iraq's weapons of mass destruction'. Does the proposed
legislation allow for the government to fine itself?

What is needed is more free speech, not less. Simply put, more free speech
equates to a more robust democracy. It will also greatly boost the country's
comedy-industrial-complex!

The federal government's time would be better spent on shutting down 'the
dark web'.
