It is easy to believe that we are all in agreement when those who disagree are silenced.

Open and honest debate is a cornerstone of a democratic society. Life is rarely black and
white but shades of grey. In a healthy society it is possible to hold differing opinions or ideas
on a variety of topics and not have to have the information filtered.

I'm not sure how the government can tackle the problem of censoring misinformation
## without self-censoring. As I have realised in recent years that the government itself has
been the source of much dangerous and harmful misinformation. Therefore, I see this as a
massive conflict of interest.

Recent misinformation provided by the government

1. mRNA Covidl9 Vaccines are safe: recent data presented by the WA Dept of Health
has shown that for 2021, the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines have a rate of adverse events
that is 24 times that of all other vaccines put together. Vaccine adverse event
registers around the globe started showing the same signal very early on in the roll­
out but that was ignored by governments including the Australian Government.
Myocarditis has generally been accepted now. It is still touted as rare and mild but
this in itself is not true. Data from ** shows that those who received boosters have a

1 in 35 occurrence of raised troponins which indicates heart damage.
Neuromuscular issues, retinal issues are just some of the long line of medium term
discoveries being studied and reported on. As this injection rapidly makes its way
into the blood stream and therefore to all tissues of the body we can expect to see
no limit to the types of pathologies occurring in the future.
Even without the enormous amount of data gradually coming to light (gradual due to
censorship), it is impossible to say that a product is safe without long-term (5-10
years) studies.

Not to mention the indications of positive correlation of excess deaths (which the
Australian Government does not believe is worth investigating) and rates of mRNA
vaccination.

2. mRNA Covidl9 Vaccines are effective: Millions of Australians have contracted Covid.
When the borders opened to only the vaccinated population, Covid spread like
wildfire. It is now becoming clearer that immune systems are suffering as a result of
the vaccine which is going into negative efficacy i.e. the more injections you get the
more likely you are to get Covid.

was, and still is, a lie to say
that they are effective. This is why the definition of vaccine had to be adjusted            - in
order to make these injections fit!

3. There is no treatment for Covid-19: the heartbreaking evidence for the falseness of
this statement is so overwhelming I don't know where to begin. It is very suspicious
that, for the first time in history, the government, via AHPRA, gagged and bound the
medical establishment to prevent them from using extremely safe and well known
off-label drugs using threats of deregistration and even imprisonment if they dared
go against the governments dictates. It is suspicious that if a known treatment were
found they would not have been able to inflict vaccinations upon the populace.

4. Lockdowns worked: to isolate people and ruin lives, educations, businesses,
relationships, the list goes on.

5. Masks are effective in protecting against Sars-Cov2            - the evidence that they work has
never been presented. In 2019, everyone from doctors to the WHO knew that masks
do not mitigate respiratory viruses, they they ALL changed their tune based on no
new evidence, this has been well documented as has the consistent failure of masks
to work on covid.

6. There is no natural immunity to Covid-19: this one is too ridiculous to even comment
on.

In the light of the above, 'Informed Consent' was not possible for ANYONE who was injected
with these substances that were touted as vaccines.

Conflicts of interest of some of the health organisations that led to the promulgation of
disinformation and misinformation over the years.

## • TGA - it is now well known that this organisation is almost 100% funded by private
interests. They cannot be trusted to provide unbiased results or advice. They knew
about the concerning data before Australia's vaccine roll-out.

## • WHO - the largest financial contributors to this captured organistion is The Bill and
Both gain substantially from the sale of
vaccines. Our government takes advice from this organisation which took the
handbook of how the handle a pandemic and threw it out the window. We did
everything backwards knowing the harms to many for the financial benefit of a few.

## • FDA - gets funding from the companies they are supposed to be regulating.

So, Who is the arbiter in determining what is correct information and what is
"misinformation", and how do they make this judgement?

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a multilateral treaty that
commits nations to respecting the civil and political rights of individuals, including the right
to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights, and
rights to due process and a fair trial.

Article 19 of the ICCPR         - Freedom of Expression 9. The natural and most obvious Article to
focus on from within those agreements is Article 19 of the ICCPR, extracted as follows:

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

I believe the increase of censorship in the guise of protecting Australians from harm is a
worrying and disturbing trend toward silencing anyone who questions those in power. This
is a right in any free society as it is becoming glaringly obvious to more and more of the
populace that those in power, especially now, tend to do what is best for themselves and
the parties who support them and not the people they govern. It is a right of every citizen to
voice their opinion, to have freedom of speech. Once this is lost, freedom is lost. We already
have so little freedom in Australia. What most people in this country believe to be freedoms
are actually privileges which can so easily be taken away. We have given away our freedoms


-----

by allowing the Government to continue determining what we are allowed and not allowed
to do in the guise of safety, security, health etc. All given away through fear, fear created by
the Government.
