The Affiliation of Australian Women’s Action Alliances (AAWAA) welcomes the
opportunity to comment on the exposure bill for the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 provided by
the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts.

AAWAA brings together women’s liberation groups from the ACT, Tasmania,
Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, all of whom contributed to and
endorsed this submission. We advocate for women and girls in all domains that
impact the lives and welfare of females, but especially where we face discrimination
or are vulnerable by reason of our sex — including online. We campaign against
homophobia and against gender-based stereotyping in education, the media, and on
the internet, and we are keenly committed to supporting and advocating for young
people impacted by gender medicine. Our groups are secular and we are not aligned
with any political party or parties.

**Our concerns**
Two concerns inform our submission. In the first instance, social media is
contributing to an alarming increase in mental health issues impacting vulnerable
young people, especially girls. Despite some token adjustments to what are known 1

as ‘recommender systems’ (that is, systems that use selective algorithms to filter 2

suggestions to end users based on the analysis of personal data), digital platform
and services providers continue to direct users to particular websites and platforms
that exacerbate a range of mental health problems; these include eating disorders 3

and childhood gender dysphoria. Combined with this, ‘algorithmic 4

audiencing’ (which amplifies messages to specific audiences) is contributing to the
accelerating spread of extreme misogyny and homophobia, impacting people of all
ages.

A second concern is that social media companies have a shameful track record of
actively censoring women who have advocated for women’s sex-based protections
and of deplatforming critics of medical interventions for gender dysphoric children.
We draw your attention to cases of Australian feminists banned from Twitter for many
years; Reddit and YouTube have also censored critics of gender ideology. 6 7 8

Detransitioners (those who regret, and believe they were harmed by, their previous
medical transition) are being similarly censored. At the same time, digital platform 9

and services providers have readily provided forums for those who advocate
violence against women and especially against feminists. The UN Rapporteur for 10

violence against women and girls has also noted the phenomenon of social media
companies removing women from social media platforms for expressing opinions
and beliefs regarding our needs, rights, and protections based on sex and/or sexual
orientation.  
11

**Government measures to combat misinformation and disinformation**
AAWAA notes that the former and current governments have been grappling with the
challenge of regulating social media for some time and that this bill represents the
latest initiative in a series of measures to that end. These include the passing of the
_Online Safety Act 2021 and the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent_
_Violent Material) Act 2019, and the creation of an eSafety Commissioner, as well as_
a range of non-legislative measures aimed at improving end-users’ digital literacy,
and the risks of misinformation.

AAWAA further recognises that this bill follows Australian Government efforts to
encourage digital platform and services providers to voluntarily address
misinformation and disinformation and that it aims in the first instance to mandate
greater transparency on the part of the providers to demonstrate their actions to
combat misinformation and disinformation. We also note that the bill provides the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with reserve powers if
industry efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation prove inadequate.

**Balancing freedom of expression with combatting misinformation and**
**disinformation**
AAWAA assesses that the current voluntary approach is ineffective; however,
transitioning to a more interventionist approach must be undertaken with the most
robust safeguards possible to insure against arbitrary censorship that would
undermine our democratic principles and exacerbate the harms that social media
companies are facilitating.

AAWAA notes that guidance to the bill asserts that, “The proposed powers seek to
strike a balance between the public interest in combatting the serious harms that can
arise from the propagation of misinformation and disinformation, with freedom of
_speech” (our emphasis). The text of the exposure draft, however, belies this claim. 12_

In fact, the bill refers only once “to freedom of expression,” a reference that is buried
in an essentially technical clause mandating an amendment to the Broadcasting
_Services Act 1992.13_ The bill makes a handful of references to the “implied freedom

of political communication” but only in the context of the development of an industry
code or industry standard for combatting misinformation and disinformation — the
third and final element in the graduated reserve powers that the ACMA seeks.

AAWAA notes that the voluntary industry code (the ‘Disinformation Code’ aka the
‘DIGI Code’) that this bill seeks to strengthen includes protection of freedom of
expression and other rights in its ‘Guiding Principles.’ It makes little sense, 14

therefore, that legislation designed to lock in minimum standards for the industry
should itself be so hesitant in regard to these principles. This is especially true given
the industry's patchy record of regulatory compliance.
15

**A human rights approach**
To remedy these deficiencies, AAWAA recommends the bill set out — clearly and
prominently — the protection of freedom of speech and other rights as a key
objective. The title of the bill should reflect this priority, viz, the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Safeguarding Freedom of Expression and Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

AAWAA further recommends that the bill include an explicit reference to rights
contained in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to
which Australia is a state party. The bill could usefully reiterate article 19 of the
Convention that sets out that, “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the

form of art, or through any other media of their choice.” We would also encourage 16

reference to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
(UNGPs) that provides a framework for businesses to promote and protect human
rights. 
17

Freedom to ‘receive’ information is particularly important if we are to encourage and
mandate transparency in the use by digital platform and services providers of
algorithms to lead end-users to specific content that increases the user’s
engagement and time on the platform but denies them — either intentionally or
incidentally — exposure to alternative viewpoints. Reference to the ICCPR
obligations and the UN Business and Human Rights Principles is preferable also to
simply referencing the “implied freedom of political communication” given the
uncertainty that the implied freedom applies only to public entities.

AAWAA assesses that grounding the legislation in human rights law will

 - Reassure Australians of the purpose of the bill.

 - Set minimum standards for industry, and in so doing ensure that digital
platform and services providers apply proper diligence to the problem of social
harms as well as mitigate the risk of bias, and of under- or over-reach.

 - Inform those who may be called upon to interpret the legislation — including
the government, administrative tribunals, and courts — that freedom of
expression is properly valued.

 - Make clear that Australia’s approach is different to the approach taken by
authoritarian states (such as Russia, Türkiye, or Singapore) that have
legislated ‘fake news’ prohibitions and have suppressed dissent under the
guise of combatting misinformation.

 - A human rights approach would also ensure Australia’s credibility in
advocating multilaterally for human rights approaches to tackling
misinformation and disinformation.

16 [International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Article 19. Our assessment of recent](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights)
decisions under the Online Safety Act 2021 reinforces our view that burying freedom of expression/
communication in legislative fine print fails to provide adequate protection for free speech in practice.
In that act – buried in part 16 ‘Miscellaneous’ is the caveat that, “This Act does not apply to the extent
(if any) that it would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication.”
Elsewhere the act empowers the e-Safety Commissioner to require social media providers to remove
content that “to the satisfaction of the commissioner” causes “serious psychological harm or distress”
(which does not include “mere ordinary emotional reactions such as those of only distress, grief, fear
and anger”). It is our view that the Commissioner unnecessarily curtailed the rights of gender critical
feminists to advocate for single-sex sport by determining that their reference to a particular individual
playing women’s sport amounted to serious harm to that individual without balancing the reality that
political communication on this subject required discussion of real-world instances of male-bodied
individuals impacting the safety of females in sport, as well as our rights to dignity and to fair

-----

**Definitions of misinformation, disinformation, and hatred**
The Guidance Notes sought views on the definitions contained within the bill of
‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ as well as on the scope of proposed informationgathering and record-keeping powers.

AAWAA assesses that definitions of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ are
inseparable from issues of free speech, transparency, and accountability because
perceptions of misinformation can be subjective and examples are intrinsically open
to challenge. AAWAA commends the intent of the exposure bill to mandate digital
platform and services providers’ record-keeping and reporting that — in theory —
should allow Australians to assess what constitutes misinformation and harm, and
whether digital platform and services provider actions to moderate content are in line
with their obligations both to protect free speech and to minimise social harms.

Intent aside, however, we are concerned that imprecise terminology in the bill carries
real risks for our free speech and other rights and protections. We are especially
concerned about the definition of the term ‘harm,’ which is defined by reference to 18

“hatred” (against certain groups), “disruption of public order or society,” and “harm to
the health of Australians.” These terms are themselves subjective and often
contested. Women’s and LGB groups that advocate for sex-based rights have lived
experience of definitions of harm being weaponised against them. Furthermore,
ever-expanding definitions of harm, as seen in the manifestos of Australian political
parties, go so far as to label the mere assertion of the immutability of sex as
‘harmful.’ We further note that the bill does not list sex as a basis upon which such 19

a harm could be experienced.

**Providing reasons**
To remedy this deficiency, AAWAA recommends the bill include formal guidance to
require digital platform and services providers to record not just the specific actions
they have taken to combat misinformation and disinformation but the basis of the
claim of harm on which their actions are based, as well as their reasoned
assessment that their actions are proportionate to the risk and that the risk is
substantiated by evidence that itself has not been subject to misinformation or
disinformation.

We would note in this context that claims of being offended are not a measure of
harm; neither is the volume of complaints received nor the proclaimed ‘progressive’
nature of a cause. Guidance and/or rules need to be sufficiently clear to mitigate
against the risk of politicised or vexatious claims that impact free speech.

We appreciate that the government is seeking an ‘evolutionary approach’ to the
problem of misinformation and disinformation, but there seems to us little point in
reserving a right to make rules for industry while also complaining of inadequacies in

-----

industry self-regulation without at the same time setting out expectations for those 20

rules. It is also very concerning that this ‘evolutionary’ approach leaves the Australian
public in the dark about the ACMA’s intentions regarding the rules and the process
for shaping them.

Of course, mandating clearer standards of harm would have resource implications
for social media companies, but these companies are some of the wealthiest and
best-resourced in the world and should therefore have little difficulty in meeting
resource requirements. To that end, AAWAA recognises that the civil penalties
proposed in the bill must be sufficiently substantive to deter companies from
dismissing them as a business cost.

**Technical design**
AAWAA would like to see the bill set out clearer expectations of industry to protect
especially vulnerable groups through the transparency of algorithms, recommender
systems, and other design features. We recognise that with generative AI, social
companies may themselves be ignorant of the exact algorithms they employ. That
said, we would expect at a minimum that the ACMA mandate platform and services
providers to keep general quantitative and qualitative data on their use of algorithms
that ‘push’ end users (identified by data ‘pulled’ from their use histories) towards
specific sites and platforms.

We would similarly expect social media companies to provide regular — and upon
request — reporting on these algorithms relating to specific subjects where credible
experts report a strong association with mental health risks. We note the second
DIGI Guidelines strengthened industry’s own reporting, but we cannot tell from the
ACMA’s own account or industry reporting the degree of compliance on specific
subjects, including the issues that were the subject of earlier whistleblower 21

concerns.

AAWAA would also like to see guidelines requiring digital platform providers to
engage directly with end-users of certain platforms that are popular with known atrisk demographic cohorts, proactively advising how the digital platform and services
provider has amplified a user’s data in relation to certain subjects; in other words,
when the provider has itself led the user into a ‘filter bubble’ or echo chamber.

**Fact-checkers and experts**
Of course, as with defining ‘misinformation,’ we recognise that the choice of what
subject matter should be the subject of any specific information-gathering and
reporting measure will engage complex judgement.

We note that the ACMA’s fact sheet states that the ACMA may work with factcheckers and third-party contractors to assist with misinformation codes and

-----

standards as well as digital platform and services provider rules. In fact, we urge 22

the ACMA to consult third parties where its expertise is lacking — including medical
and psychological health experts.

But equally the ACMA must — including through its own transparency measures —
ensure that the fact-checkers are themselves impartial. AAWAA’s experience is that
on matters concerning women’s sex-based protections and transgender medicine,
fact-checkers have been demonstrably biassed. We note universities — which are 23

often called upon to provide fact-checking services — are themselves prone to
ideological capture on the issue of sex and gender. 
24

In this regard, AAWAA is troubled that a number of Australian Public Service
agencies, as well as the ABC and SBS, have compromised their impartiality on
matters of sex and gender through their participation in the Australian Workplace
Equality Index (AWEI) scheme. This scheme — run by the advocacy group ACON —
rewards participating institutions (such as media organisations, government
departments, and universities) for meeting ACON’s arbitrary standards rather than
the standards of evidence and impartiality that these institutions are otherwise
obliged to meet. We suggest the committee look to the experience of the United 25

Kingdom in this regard.
26

The ACMA must itself avoid similar conflicts of interests and/or promulgating or
reinforcing misinformation and disinformation.

**Government immunity**
Guidance notes to the bill also sought views on the scope of the informationgathering and recording keeping powers regarding false, misleading, or deceptive
information on digital platforms and services.

-----

We note that the bill excludes government websites from its scope. Guidance notes 27

offer no explanation for this exclusion though we are aware that other mechanisms
— including parliamentary committee scrutiny and freedom of information laws —
might provide a measure of accountability for government actions.

That said, we believe that the discipline of requiring government agencies to address
misinformation on their own platforms could help them safeguard Australians
against, for example, the process derailment that resulted in Robodebt. We note in
this context that governments are not immune from individual and class actions
seeking redress for harm that results from government misinformation. Advice on the
Australian Government’s Health Direct website that claims the effects of puberty
blockers are fully reversible is one such egregious example of state, territory, and
Commonwealth misinformation. 
28

**Duplication**
We also recommend that the drafters carefully consider the potential confusion and
harm this bill may create in covering matters already covered by existing laws. As
already noted, the bill lists “disruption to public order or society in Australia” as an
area where misinformation could cause serious harm, with guidance notes providing
the example of “misinformation that encouraged or caused people to vandalise
critical communications infrastructure.” Given that police already have certain 29

powers — with appropriate safeguards for unwarranted intrusions into people's civil
liberties — to take pre-emptive action to protect infrastructure, granting the ACMA
powers for this purpose would seem questionable. Australians who value their right
to peaceful protest may reasonably question the purpose of this element of the bill.
Laws that overreach in this regard may in fact deter some people from airing their
political views at all.

**Complaint procedures**
AAWAA supports the requirement that digital platform and services providers put in
place rigorous and transparent policies and procedures for handling reports and
complaints from end-users. We believe that the bill should also mandate that the
ACMA publish its complaints procedures and report on outcomes. Poor
accountability risks further alienating those distrustful of government and has a
chilling effect on those seeking to freely express their political views.

It is also imperative that the ACMA receive sufficient resources to exercise any new
powers as it is already inadequate to the task of meeting its existing

**Mandating periodic reviews**
We strongly recommend that the bill include a requirement for the parliament to
mandate periodic reviews, a safeguard that would protect against unintended
consequences against a background of rapidly changing digital technologies such as
generative AI.

**Parliamentary scrutiny**
A well-judged act could do much to address the problem of online harm while a
poorly constructed act will exacerbate current problems and undermine trust in the
ACMA. For this reason, we hope the government takes the time necessary to get
this legislation right. We hope the minister recommends referring a revised bill to the
appropriate parliamentary committee and that the committee chooses to conduct a
public inquiry. We look forward to the minister’s Statement of Compatibility with
Human Rights and the scrutiny of that statement by the Parliamentary Joint
Committee on Human Rights.[31]
