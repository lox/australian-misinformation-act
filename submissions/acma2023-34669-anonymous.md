I am against this bill on many fronts, particularly, I disagree that misinformation should be part of
this bill at all.

The first 'Key point' on the fact sheet is already vague.
"Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to safety and wellbeing of Australians ..."
What really keeps people safe? A home, having food and shelter - these things are tangible.
Information can't provide this nor take this away. Information is merely words. it is content that
may or may not be read, viewed, heard. It has no direct power to cause physical harm or injury.

Information, what ever type of it is - is to inform. By itself there is no action.

Information: facts provided or learned about something or someone

Misinformation as defined in the fact Sheet:
'is online content that is false, misleading or deceptive that is shared without intent to deceive but
can cause and contribute to serious harm.

Who is to determine what constitutes misinformation?
What it viewed misinformation one day can be proved correct and valid later. For example, taking
the aboriginal children away from the their parents was thought to be the right thing to do at the
time but is now proven to be a poor decision.

Misinformation has been shown in history to simply be another print of view.

A piece of information, however it is labelled, can on it's own do nothing.
Information provided to people is up to the people to discern and make the best decisions for
themselves.
How can we be sure that this is not a form of mind control. That the government is then dictating
what information people have access to, dictating what people are to think, and what is 'allowed' to
be shared. Any thought that looks at other opinions or options could be called 'misinformation'
purely because it represent an alternative view.
People should be allowed to think and decide for themselves.
This bill restricts freedom of information, blocking the sharing of information. It should be stopped.
