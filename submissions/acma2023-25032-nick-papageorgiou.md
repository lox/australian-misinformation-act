# Submission regarding proposed new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

## It is ironic that at a time when the Australian Government is seeking to alter the Constitution in order to purportedly give a ‘Voice’ to our indigenous people, it is also seeking to deprive all Australians of a voice through this Orwellian legislation which will be tantamount to instituting a Ministry of Truth where only Government approved information is permitted in the public domain.

 It is bad enough that we, the Australian people, do not have the protection of the equivalent of the US First Amendment enshrined in the Australian Constitution, the Government is proposing to codify the suppression of free speech by compelling digital platform providers to remove content their ‘systems’ deem to fit the definition of misinformation or disinformation. 

 Conveniently, the Government itself, is exempt from this proposed legislation as are professional news services, with the reasonable conclusion to be drawn that these entities are incapable of misinforming or disinforming the public. This conclusion is in itself, disinformation or misinformation, whatever the distinction is between these buzz words.

 I will provide one striking example where the Government and what certainly in this instance was its mouthpiece media, were guilty of disinformation and misinformation, namely, when it spouted the mantra that the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ were safe and effective and that they prevent infection and transmission of the COVID- 19 virus.

 It is well-established that the FDA clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines’ were not designed to clinically and statistically demonstrate that the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’  prevent infection, prevent transmission, or protect against disease, hospitalizations, and death. 1-8

 It is evident from the draft legislation that the digital platform providers will be charged with policing and determining whether communications constitute disinformation or misinformation through their ‘systems’, presumably their algorithms. The questions arise whether they are

## ultimately responsible for assessing whether content fits the definition or whether it is ACMA or someone else and what makes the ultimate determining body the sole, infallible arbiter for determining whether content is disinformation or misinformation? What safeguards or rights of redress are there in the draft legislation for errors in judgment – something which is not beyond the realms of possibility, as per the spectacular example above?

 A defining feature of totalitarian governments is putting systems in place in order to suppress free speech. When the people fear their government, we have dictatorship. When the government fears its people, we have democracy. I fear that with proposed legislation such as this, we are lurching further towards the former.

 Does our government have a similar program to that which was brazenly conveyed below, hence its fervent desire to ostensibly control the narrative?

 “We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false”. .

 Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, who experienced first-hand, the horrors of a totalitarian regime, famously stated in his magnus opus, The Gulag Archipelago, that “Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty”. [Solzhenitsyn in an interview with Pravda, 1986] “We have a choice to make once and for all: between the empire and the spiritual and physical salvation of our people. No road for the people will ever be open unless the government completely gives up control over us or any aspect of our lives. It has led the country into an abyss and it does not know the way out”. It is interesting to note that Solzhenitsyn foresaw way back in the 1970s that the West’s complacency and government overreach was leading us down to a similar path of destruction and totalitarianism. What we have seen, particularly, over the last 3 or so years, is the tendency for Australian governments of all levels and persuasions for this overreach, with tragic consequences for the Australian people and economy and this piece of Orwellian legislation is another startling example of this overreach. 9

 I will conclude by observing that the message that the government is conveying with this legislation, as it did over the last 3 years or so, is that it does not trust its people and that it alone, is the font of all wisdom and truth. In other words, to paraphrase Plato in his Republic, “If no one knows what’s true, the more powerful person will tell you what’s true”.
