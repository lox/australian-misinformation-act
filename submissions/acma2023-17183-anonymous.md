**Subject: Strong Opposition to the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill**

Dear Minister for Communication,

I am writing to you as a deeply concerned Australian citizen about
the 'Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill' currently under
discussion. As a strong proponent of democratic values, free speech, and civic
responsibility, I believe there are significant aspects of this bill that require careful
consideration.

Firstly, while the intent of the bill to address the widespread issue
of misinformation and disinformation is commendable and to some extent necessary.
I am primarily concerned about the potential infringement upon the absolute right to
freedom of speech in our country, as well as our human rights protected under
Section 16 of the Human Rights Act 2004. This crucial legislation affirms that
everyone has the right to hold opinions without interference, and everyone has the
right to freedom of expression. The loose definitions of "misinformation" and
"disinformation" could lend themselves to subjective interpretations and may be used
as a tool to suppress legitimate, albeit dissenting voices, under the guise of
preventing untruths, in direct contradiction with these established rights.

I implore you to think about the potential for selective enforcement and political bias
that may be unintentionally encouraged by this bill. There is inherent danger in
assigning any entity with the power to arbitrate what is true and what is not,
particularly within the complex realm of politics, where truth is often multifaceted.
This could lead to an inadvertent inhibitory effect on free speech, where individuals
might fear expressing their views because of the risk of being penalised.

Furthermore, the privacy implications of such a bill are deeply concerning. To
effectively identify misinformation and disinformation, a substantial level of scrutiny
and surveillance of digital communications will be necessary, which might be seen
as an overreach of power and a violation of privacy rights.

While we must undoubtedly fight against the spread of false information that has the
potential to harm our society and undermine confidence in our institutions, it is
imperative that we do so in a way that does not impinge on the basic freedoms on
which our society is based.

I am hopeful that when you are considering your stance on


-----

the 'Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill', you will keep these
concerns at the forefront of your mind. Any legislation on this topic must be
thoroughly considered to ensure it mitigates the spread of misinformation without
compromising our deeply held democratic principles.

I trust in your commitment to uphold the freedoms that make Australia a democratic
nation, including the absolute right to free speech and the right to dissent. I hope that
you will take into account the significance of this matter and work towards an
effective solution that combats misinformation while safeguarding the freedoms that
define our society.

Thank you for your dedicated service to our state and country, and for your
consideration of this vital issue. I look forward to your thoughtful response.

Yours sincerely,
