To Whom it May Concern,

I write in relation to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This Bill should not be allowed to pass into law under any circumstances. I am strongly against
providing powers to the government (ACMA), or to big-tech companies being forced by the government,
which compels the censorship of the views of Australians online, irrelevant of how “right” or “wrong”
some may deem those views to be.

It is never the place of government to be the arbiters of truth and such a concept is simply incompatible
with a democracy.

To control one’s speech is to control one’s thought. To control one’s thought is to remove personal
agency and ability to make informed decisions. Error is required in order to learn. Discussion of
erroneous positions is required to reach reasonable conclusions, without the need of an overbearing

referee.

Imperfect governments and their agencies are comprised of imperfect people, often distant from the
origin of ideas. Therefore, they least appropriate group in society to be seeking this level of power over
citizens.

Further, the implications of any such law will require the deployment of vast resources to police ideas

and thoughts, with detrimental punishment to otherwise exemplary members of the Australian
community. To push freedom of thought underground is more dangerous than having bad ideas
challenged by peers though open public discussion. It is a lack of judgement to believe otherwise.

Government cannot bestow this level of power upon itself. It is an illegitimate assumption of power, and
nothing more.

This Bill should never have even been conceived, let alone reach draft stage and be considered in any

serious way.

Yours Faithfully,

Gerard Saunders
