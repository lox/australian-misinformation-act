**I am absolutely AGAINST the amendments to give the ACMA new powers to combat**
**misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services.**

Firstly….isn’t information just information? Isn’t it incumbent upon people to consider and reflect
upon that information rather than be directed to adopt someone else’s view that what they are
receiving as information is dis….or mis…?

I would suggest that this argument from the Government that any ‘misinformation’ or
‘disinformation’ is a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians is fallacious. The constant
barrage of this or that being ‘mis’ or ‘dis’ is actually more unsettling and distressful as people are
not allowed the peace and quiet to think for themselves.

I do find it interesting that Government is still telling people that the COVID-19 ‘vaccinations’ are
safe and effective when most people know friends, family and others who have either ‘died
suddenly’ or who are suffering from adverse reactions to the ‘vaccinations’. Isn’t the Government
continuing to spread ‘misinformation’ by encouraging people to get them without providing us with
the latest data regarding these adverse effects? Where is the accountability here?

I also fail to understand why the Government has chosen to exempt itself from the restrictions it
seeks to place upon we the people. I find this similar to Big Pharma being given exemption from
prosecution to any adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccinations. If you are confident about the
safety of your product – exemptions would hardly be necessary. Similarly, if the Government is
confident in providing the TRUTH, it has nothing to fear from any discussion the people seek to
have on any social platform.

It is only a Government afraid of people finding out what it is really up to that would seek to
attempt to silence people in this way.

This is NOT democratic.
This is NOT what the Albanese Government told people it would do when it was seeking to be
elected.
It was not given a mandate to silence the voice of the people.
Especially as it is seeking to give total control (The Voice) to a few rather than allowing ALL
AUSTRALIANS freedom to speak.

_TRUTH does not mind being questioned. A LIE does not like being challenged._
