To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications
and the Arts.

I oppose the draft bill with absolute certainty titled "Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". As an Australian
citizen, I am deeply concerned about the implications of this bill on our freedom of speech
and its disproportionate impact on regular citizens.

Firstly, this bill reveals a lack of respect for the freedom of speech of Australian citizens. By
creating two classes of citizens        - one consisting of politicians, journalists, and members of
educational institutions who have the power to spread information, whether true or false,
online, and the other comprising regular citizens who may possess more knowledge on
certain topics        - this bill infringes upon the democratic values that our society is built upon.

Moreover, this bill poses a significant threat to the power of the internet as a democratic
invention. The internet has provided a platform for ordinary people to have a voice, and this
legislation risks suppressing their voices disproportionately. The excessive fines imposed by
the bill will lead to digital services becoming excessively restrictive in their approach to
speech, which is even more severe than the restrictions imposed by the most stringent
services currently available. The fact that the code applies universally across the industry
# without any "pressure escape valves" exacerbates the potential harm.

Furthermore, accurately judging what is true or false is an impossible task. New information
is constantly emerging, often contradicting what was once deemed widely accepted fact. I
want to draw your attention to a list of examples where authority figures and expert
consensus have been proven wrong. These instances, related to COVID-19, could very well
be considered misinformation under the proposed legislation. It is important to
acknowledge that the dissemination of such information is part of the process of
discovering new truths and refining our knowledge.

Moreover, it is not just provably false information that will be targeted under this bill, but
also information deemed "misleading" or "deceptive". Freedom of speech is valuable
precisely because it allows for open and honest discussions, even if they involve differing
opinions or mistakes. It is through such discussions that the truth can be unearthed and
consensus can be reached.

It is disheartening to witness that even experts, who were appointed to steward truth, have
raised serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a
former Deputy Chief Medical Officer, has publicly expressed doubt regarding the
implementation and consequences of this legislation. His skepticism undermines the notion
that expert consensus is infallible, and prompts us to consider the potentially detrimental
effects of this bill.

Furthermore, the proposed delegation of legislative power in this bill to private entities and
the ACMA raises constitutional concerns. The principles established by the High Court reject
such a delegation of lawmaking authority to entities not directly accountable to Parliament.
This potential constitutional abdication of legislative power should be a cause for alarm.

Additionally, the power granted to the ACMA to enact Misinformation Codes and Digital
Platform Rules violates the implied constitutional freedom of political communication.
Matters related to public policy, scientific investigation, and debate, which are highly
contested among political parties and interest groups, should not be subject to unnecessary
limitations. Restricting legitimate discussions on these topics would unreasonably curtail the
implied constitutional freedom of political communication.

Lastly, this bill creates two classes of citizens. Those deemed trustworthy, including the
government, approved media, and educational institutions, are exempt from content
monitoring, while others are subject to potential monitoring and reporting under the guise
of combating misinformation. This division undermines the principles of equality and
democratic participation.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is profoundly flawed and threatens our freedom of speech and
the democratic fabric of our society. I urge the Department to reconsider and address the
concerns raised in this submission.

Sincerely,
