We strongly oppose this communist style Bill.

Who decides what is misinformation and disinformation?

During Covid, we now see that a lot of the information that came from government sources was in
fact misinformation and disinformation, in contrast, content from highly qualified health experts
was censored but actually contained factually correct and life saving information. Covid was a
terrible period for all and made worse by the government overreach that occurred, but one thing
Covid did teach us is that the Government need to be reigned in, not given more reach to control
our lives. The government seem to forget that they work for the people, not the other way around.

It has been made public that the Government influenced social media platforms to censor non
govt approved information. This is incredibly disturbing and alarming. This bill will put way too
much power in the hands of the few and the implications are disturbingly dangerous and could
potentially cost lives.

When the Biden Government tried to pass similar censorship, the US court shut it down. It was
deemed unconstitutional and anti-democratic.

Government approved speech, which the past proves will be the result of this Bill, is a dystopian
nightmare with Ministry of Truth vibes.
