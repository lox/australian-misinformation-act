Please leave free speech alone and do not incorporate or give power to any government body
to regulate what it deems to be 'correct' or 'safe' speech through electronic platforms or
otherwise.

We live in a beautiful country that is built on the value of freedom of speech - we need more
free speech, not less.

Please keep it this way.

Kind regards,

Adam
