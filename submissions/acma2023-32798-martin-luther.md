**Response** **to** **legislation** **on** **Misinformation** **and** **disinformation.**

This is a completely unnecessary assault on free speech. It trivialises and infantilises citizens
assuming they cannot make decisions for themselves.

There is no way that some bureaucrat can be trusted to assess whether speech fits the very broad
definitions in this legislation. They will instead impose their personal predilections on society. We

have already seen that the so-called fact checkers are compromised by their bias. There is no
independent authority than can determine what is and what isn't bad information. In a democracy
each individual makes their own judgement without help from their "betters". This legislation smacks
of feudalism!

A further issue is the inability to separate comment from fact. Comment is not a fact that can be
checked by someone else. Comment should be free from interference by government, bureaucracy
and other do-gooders.

The legislation is itself misinformation. It makes the tech companies liable for comment on their
platform. Final adjudication by the ACMA a government QUANGO. All to deceive us into believing it is
not the government that is imposing censorship.

Looking over recent events it is clear to me that the major purveyors of mis/dis information are the
Media, Government and politicians generally. Yet these are exempt! It is only citizens that are to be
censored. The result is that if the Government proposes an outrageous program, then we the citizens
will be prevented from identifying the negative aspects of the proposal! Government will be free to
impose arrogant and destructive imposts on the citizens. It is already clear that government imposts
are making our cost of living rise dramatically and yet this legislation can be used to stop any
criticism.

This is a bad concept and terrible drafting. It should be abandoned.
