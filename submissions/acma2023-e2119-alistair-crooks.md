**Appendix to my Submission on the proposed “Misinformation and**
**Disinformation” Bill dated 4/8/2023 – Alistair Crooks.**

In my first submission I argued against the imposition of this proposed
legislation (“Misinformation and Disinformation” Bill) on the grounds of its
attack on the free flow of information in the public domain – one of the very
foundational requirements of a liberal democracy.  It advantages an unelected
“elite” to define what information should be circulated and what should be
suppressed, without any safeguards for the general public.

That this is open to abuse was laid bare by the example of the 50 medical
“experts” who published a letter in the prestigious medical journal, Lancet,
giving the definitive opinion that the Covid-19 virus did not come from the Wu
Han Biomedical Research laboratory, but from a neighbouring “wet market.”
(see The Lancet Letter.

That this, and other “expert” opinion of the time, became the basis for the
suppression of all opposing opinions, is a matter of record. That these “expert”
opinions were knowingly false, even at the time, is also a matter of public record
as was revealed only some 18 months later. The damage to careers and
reputations of those who simply argued for the truth is also irrefutable. The
excuse “working on the best available information at the time” or “in the public
interest” is not sufficient in a true liberal democracy.

A recent Australian example of the process may be seen in the attempt by the
Prime Minister to suppress the existence of the 26 page Ululu Statement
document as “conspiracy theory” – which no doubt would have led to the
“cancelling” of all opposing opinion as “disinformation”, was unfortunately (for
the Prime Minister) only thwarted by the document already being available
under Freedom of Information.

This openness to abuse being the case, and given that the threat that this
proposed legislation will be passed into law, it strikes me that certain minimum
safeguards would be required.

Firstly, in the implementation of this legislation the “onus of proof” should rest
with the “elite” experts to provide substantial, “beyond reasonable doubt”,
evidence that any information is false, misleading or disinformation. Suppression
on the basis of an unsubstantiated opinion of some “expert” to a private
backroom committee should not be allowed, but should be fully tested in an
open court where a jury of reasonable and independent public make the decision
on whether the “expert” opinion passes the beyond reasonable doubt test. The
test of “harm” should also be open to discussion. The full legal force of the
Freedom Of Information process and laws pertaining to “Disclosure” should
apply to the whole process of decision-making with respect to the decision of
what represents “misinformation” or “disinformation” so that the process is both
fair and transparent.  This is how a liberal democracy is supposed to work.

Secondly, there should be substantial punitive provisions against all those of the
“elite” who abuse their status as “experts” to provide false information or
misleading opinion, knowingly or otherwise, which is then used to suppress
information which subsequently proves to be correct. The excuse “It was based
on the best information we had at the time” should not be allowed on the
grounds that even “experts” should be subjected to the full implications of
“beyond reasonable doubt” test. All of their misgivings must be aired at the time
that suppression of information is being made.

Thirdly, at a minimum, the legislation should include provision for compensation
to all people who are affected by this legislation who are subsequently proved to
be correct. Punitive damages should be awarded to any person whose income or
reputation has been damaged by the labeling of their opinions as
“misinformation” or “disinformation”.
