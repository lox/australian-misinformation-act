I am writing in response to the new law relating to "misinformation". For decades Australians have been subjected to Murdochs'
malign and corrosive editorials and right wing bigotry and ignorance masquerading as " the voice of reason" or " the high moral
ground". Why is it that he and his people are free to pollute our discourse and yet the public square is suddenly being subjected
to censorship ? Risible policy.

Ben Mitchell
