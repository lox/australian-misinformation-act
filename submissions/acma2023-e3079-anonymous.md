Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I would like to express my concerns about the Misinformation Bill, which places in jeopardy ordinary Australians' right
to free speech, restricting it to a privileged few.

I strongly reject this proposed legislation. The draft says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”. More harm
will be caused by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the rights of the individual,
not suppressing them.

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” causes grave concerns about this
bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from getting
and spreading the virus. Those who questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media. Yet it soon became
obvious to everyone the government was wrong, and the “misinformation” was right! Nearly every Australian was
vaccinated for Covid-19, yet the virus kept spreading until almost every Australian caught it!

The rationale for censorship on this issue might have been well-intentioned. But time has proven the censorship at
best misinformed.

This one example shows why allowing the government the power to legislate against free speech is a recipe for
disaster.

This bill must be rejected.
