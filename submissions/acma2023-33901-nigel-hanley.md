 Disinformation) Bill 2023

 Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

 Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

###### Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the draft bill

###### titled "Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

 Disinformation) Bill 2023". As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill

 undermines the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and disregards the

 voices of regular citizens in our democracy.

 The presence of this bill clearly indicates that the Government does not respect

##### the freedom of speech rights of Australian citizens. The bill creates two distinct

###### classes of citizens, with politicians, journalists, and members of educational

 institutions being granted the power to spread information, whether true or false. On

##### the other hand, regular citizens, who often possess more knowledge about certain

###### topics than those in the first category, are excluded and risk having their voices

 suppressed.

In my strongly held view, the internet is the most powerful democratic invention

##### of our time, empowering ordinary people to have a voice. This bill puts these regular

###### people at a disproportionate disadvantage and risks harming their ability to freely

 express themselves.

 Moreover, the excessive fines imposed by the bill will lead to digital services

 becoming even more restrictive in monitoring speech, surpassing the limitations

 imposed by the most restrictive digital services today. This harm will be compounded


-----

###### by the fact that the code applies uniformly across the entire industry, without any

 provisions for flexibility or exceptions.

It is impossible to accurately determine what is true or untrue. New information

is constantly being discovered, challenging previously widely accepted facts. The

###### example of misinformation surrounding COVID-19 is a testament to this, with

 information perceived as accurate at one point changing as new evidence emerges.

 This legislation could lead to the removal of valuable public health information that

 was once considered accurate but is later found to be misleading.

 Furthermore, the bill's scope includes not only provably false information but

 also true information that is deemed "misleading" or "deceptive." Freedom of speech

 allows for open and honest discussions, even when there are disagreements or

 inaccuracies. It is through these discussions that the truth can be uncovered and

 common ground can be found. By allowing the censorship of even true but

 "misleading" information, this bill undermines the very essence of freedom of speech.

It is concerning that even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical

###### Officer of Australia, has raised significant concerns about the scope and application

##### of this bill. His scathing remark on Twitter questions the feasibility and fairness of

###### implementing such legislation. If even one of the experts appointed to oversee health

 information disputes the bill, it raises serious doubts about its validity and

 effectiveness.


-----

###### The proposed industry codes, created by industry bodies potentially influenced

 by dominant players, risk becoming tools for anti-competitive practices. These codes

will create onerous requirements that primarily benefit large digital services and make

###### it extremely challenging for new entrants to compete in the market. The bill indirectly

 grants large digital services the power to damage their smaller competitors by

 burdening them with infringements and regulatory demands, thereby stifling

 innovation and free-market competition.

 Moreover, the proposed bill solely focuses on large platforms while inadvertently

 encompassing thousands of community websites in its broad definitions. This lack of

 consideration for smaller platforms and websites contradicts the principles upheld by

 competition regulators worldwide, which strive to lower barriers to entry for

 competitors in the interest of consumers.

 The proposed bill also applies extraterritorially, subjecting foreign entities to

 Australian laws and regulations without their knowledge or ability to comply. This

 unworkable concept not only raises significant concerns about overreach but also

 risks Australia becoming isolated from the global internet community.

 The bill's provisions are at odds with the principles of freedom of political

 communication, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By

 categorizing certain political viewpoints as misinformation, this bill restricts citizens'

 access to vital information necessary for informed decision-making.


-----

###### Additionally, the threats and intimidation imposed on digital platform providers

##### and regular users, outlined in the bill, constitute a violation of individual liberties and

 the democratic values we hold dear. The requirement to report and potentially "dobÂ­

in" fellow citizens is reminiscent of oppressive regimes. Australia should be a beacon

##### of tolerance and respect for diverse viewpoints, rather than resorting to such

###### authoritarian measures.

 Furthermore, the bill's overreliance on designated platforms and the exclusion of

 certain viewpoints perpetuate an unfair and discriminatory environment. The

 government-approved journalists and institutions benefit disproportionately by

 stifling competition and suppressing alternative perspectives. This not only

 undermines the democratic process but also hinders the public's access to diverse and

##### independent sources of information.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

###### Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is deeply flawed and raises significant

 concerns about the erosion of freedom of speech and individual liberties. This bill

 fails to recognize the value of diverse viewpoints, stifles innovation, and ignores the

 principles of fair competition. I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure,

 Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider this

bill and uphold the democratic values and freedoms that make our country great.

###### Yours sincerely,

 Nigel Hanley
