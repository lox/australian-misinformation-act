To The Committie for the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill,

As a voting Australian citizen I am voicing my concern at the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill that will take away our
fundamental human right of freedom of opinion and expression.

My views opposing this Bill:

. it is an attack on freedom of speech that is not consistent with Australia’s international humans rights obligations and is out
of step with equivalent European laws.
. too much power is given to the government, that will silence religious and political freedom of speech.
. it fails to include mechanisms to protect valid expression of opinion and belief or to ensure that there are clear abd defined
limits on suppression of speech.
. it is a significant overreach by the government.
. it is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under international human rights instruments
like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
. it puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence in the public square without transparency and
accountabliity.
. it does nto provide a sufficient standard of accountability abd oversight for misuse of censorship powers.
. the severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and standards and for failing to provide
evidence requesred by ACMA is excessive and will provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.

The freedom of speech we have in Australia will forever be misued and severly take this right of Australians away to voice
their own options and express with honesty.

Sincerely,
Karen Eldridge
