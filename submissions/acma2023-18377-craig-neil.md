 Subject: proposed powers to be given to ACMA and Government overreach with regards to free speech, including speech on digital platforms
 Dear Minister Rowland, 
 I have grave concerns with the increased powers proposed to be given to ACMA. Meaning that a group of unelected bureaucrats will be the sole arbiter on what is misinformation and disinformation. Considering the misinformation and disinformation during the covid alarmism period all came from governments and unelected bureaucrats such as the TGA, Skerritt, Paul Kelly and the Department of Health and our only hope for correct information was online from the likes of Dr Peter McCullough, Dr Aseem Malhotra, Dr Pierre Kory, Dr Paul Merricks, Prof Geert Vandon Bossche and many more. 
 Without these giants in the medical field, we would be left in the dark with lies and misinformation from governments (Federal and State) and the likes of the TGA whom is 96% funded by Pharma, hardly independent. 
 We the people can decide on which information is correct or not. We aren’t fools like governments; we are more than capable of reading. The last thing we need are dictators like the Australian Government to decide on what is correct or not. 
 Have we become a communist state already? If not, we are certainly on the fast track to be one!
 Stay out of our lives. Haven’t governments done enough damage to our country in the last three years with their overreach and dictatorship; removing our God given liberties? 
 Considering you are the communication minister; would it be a fair presumption that you will communicate back to me with a meaningful response clearly addressing all the points raised. I don’t want the usual lip service and stock standard response.

# I am presuming you are Catholic or a Christian of some sort and as such truth ought to matter to you. The reason we have health problem is because of the misinformation and disinformation of governments ranging from the blocking of early treatments to the dangerous experimental covid 19 vaccines. The governments lied to the people of Australia and as result some trusted the government but now, they are regretting doing so. So why on earth do we want more bureaucrats filtering our information on digital platforms. 
 I simply don’t trust governments as they give me no reason to do so. There is only a handful of politicians I would trust. 
 Please understand I have a medical background and I can back up what I say with facts, government data, science, and peer reviewed studies. 
 As a catholic you would understand our freewill is given by God not our corrupt Governments. Please put a stop to this draft legislation. It stinks of communism. We saw Dan Andrews arrest those whom disagreed with his government. Maybe that is the reason why people call him Dictator Dan.
 I hope I have made myself Crystal clear, take our free speech and freedom answer to God. Mess with Gods people, you mess with God. 
 God Bless you and your beautiful family. 
 Yours Sincerely  Craig Neil
