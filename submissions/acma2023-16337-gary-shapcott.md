SUBMISSION to the Australian Government, Department of Infrastructure, regarding an

exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

— Gary Shapcott, July 2023

After 40 years of neoliberalism, we know that deregulation, self-regulation, small

government and all the rest of the neoliberal ideological package serve simply to allow

corporations to pursue profits without regard to the toxic effects of their activities on our

society. In the sphere of communications, we know already that industry efforts in regard

to misinformation and disinformation are inadequate and will remain so until

governments step up and start applying regulation with teeth.

ACMA needs to move immediately to create and enforce an industry standard—with

public consultation—and to have the power to request specific content or posts be

removed from digital platform services—allowing for public debate in each case under

the auspices of an ACMA tribunal.

The Bill in its current form is continued deregulation with regulation held in reserve—for

another 40 years?

While in my view the proposed Bill does not go far enough, it nonetheless represents a

step in the right direction and should be supported. Critics are already saying it

represents an attack on 'free speech'. Here then I direct the bulk of my comments to a


**refutation of the view that, in the public sphere, individuals somehow have a 'right'**


**to unrestrained 'freedom of expression' or 'free speech'.**


There is nothing self-evident about such a right; ideas about liberty, freedom, human

rights, popular sovereignty and so on are contested concepts. There are those who

identify two main strands of theory: liberal and republican. See on YouTube, for a good

overview, Quentin Skinner 'On the liberty of republics' <here> and 'A genealogy of

liberty' <here>. See also 'Freedom with Philip Pettit: conversations with history' <here>.

We would do well to read or re-read Tocqueville's Democracy in America: ‘In the United

States ... it was never claimed that man in a free country has the right to do whatever he

pleases. Indeed, the range of social obligations imposed on him was wider than in other

countries’; a kind of freedom realised in mutual obligation. [Tocqueville, A 2004 (c. 1850),

_Democracy in America, trans. A Goldhammer, The Library of America, New York: Vol 1,_

Part 1, Chap 5, pp. 79-80; see also Vol 1, Part 1, Chap 2, p. 48.]

And read or re-read John Stuart Mill. Mill, in his famous essay On liberty (1859), sought

to define ‘the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by

society over the individual’. He came up with two maxims: ‘the individual is not

accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no

person but himself’ but ‘for such actions as are prejudicial to the interests of others, the

individual is accountable, and may be subjected either to social or to legal punishment, if

society is of opinion that the one or the other is requisite for its protection’. For Mill there

were two kinds of liberty, the liberty that could be exercised by individuals in accordance

with his first maxim and, secondly, ‘civil or social liberty’, the liberty that could be

exercised by society in accordance with his second maxim. Mill, like many other Western

political thinkers from the 1500s, placed freedom centre stage in his political theory but

did not see it as something belonging exclusively to individuals; there was also ‘civil or

social liberty’. [Mill, J S 1998 (1859), On liberty and other essays, ed. John Gray, Oxford

University Press: pp. 5, 104]

The republicanism of Philip Pettit is particularly instructive:

"Government inevitably involves interference in the lives of citizens, whether via

legislation, punishment, or taxation. ... this interference need not be dominating,

however—and need not be inherently inimical to freedom—so long as the people

affected by the interference share equally in controlling the form that it takes. Let state

interference be guided equally by the citizenry and it will not reflect an alien power or

will in their lives. ... [It will be] a regime under which the interference of government is

exercised on terms laid down by the people and not at the unlimited discretion of those

in power. Such a regime would count in a strict and demanding sense as a democracy. It

would live up to the Greek etymology of the word, providing the people, or demos, with

power, or kratos, in relation to their government." [Philip Pettit 2014, Just freedom: a

_moral compass for a complex world, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, p. xx]_

Instructive also is the republicanism of Zygmunt Bauman. In our communal search for the

common good, Bauman says, favouring republican over liberal democratic theory, we

have ‘to strike a balance between the individual’s liberty from interference and the

_citizen’s right to interfere’, in the end making laws together—with as many people as_

possible participating in that process—that best reflect the public interest. [Zygmunt

Bauman 1999, In search of politics, Polity Press, UK, pp. 4, 166]

Let us ask what exactly is 'free speech'? 'Free' is an adjective and 'speech' is a noun, so

let's look at the noun first. We all mutter to ourselves from time to time but typically

speech is an act of communication that involves two or more people engaged alternately

as speaker / listener(s), writer / reader(s), sender / receiver(s). It is fundamentally a social

phenomenon and best described as conversation, dialogue, discussion, debate,

deliberation, and all the kinds of communication that create what is called the public

sphere. The question then really is what makes a free conversation (or debate etc), or a

**free public sphere, or 'freedom of political communication' as the High Court of**

Australia has put it? I ll use the term public debate below as shorthand for all the

relevant categories of communication because we are primarily concerned here with

speech that occurs in public rather than in private.

Let's start again, this time with debate as the noun and public debate our focus.

In a public debate, ideally, people listen to others and in turn expect to be listened to.

They deliberate on issues not behind closed doors, not secretly, but in full view of one

another and of anyone else who cares to see and hear. They encounter alternative

perspectives, not just those of like-minded persons within their familiar circle. They learn

to articulate their goals and priorities in ways that appeal to others, to sharpen their

sense of the realistic options and necessary trade-offs, to abandon support for

indefensible positions, and to develop with those with whom they are in dialogue a

mutual respect that allows them to coexist and cooperate when they disagree. They ask

other people, especially their opponents, exactly what they mean, asking them to spell

out, elaborate on, articulate their view. They know when it is appropriate to express an

opinion and when it is necessary to defer to experts.

A good public debate is one where all participants have a good understanding of what

makes a statement true or false, well-argued or just a series of unfounded assertions,

morally right or morally wrong, or in the public interest rather than in the private interests

of the few—common ground, in other words, on which communication can proceed.

Participants also need to be committed to telling the truth, seeking the truth and finding

solutions to problems that affect our common future—a common purpose, in other

words, and that being the common good.

In a good public debate, which is what should happen in the political public sphere

especially, where so much is at stake, nothing is left to ‘common sense’, left in that

shadowy world of the unsaid where things ‘go without saying’. Ideas are teased out,

dispersed across numerous attempts at articulation, each person expressing to the other

what they think the other is saying as much as expressing their own point of view.

A conversation about politics, in a democratic society, Christopher Lasch tells us,

provides the opportunity for people to ‘go beyond their circle’, ‘... to mingle on an equal

footing with persons from all realms of life, to gain access to larger currents of opinion,

and to exercise the rights and duties of citizenship’. [Christopher Lasch 1996, The revolt

_of the elites and the betrayal of democracy, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, p. 58]_

To measure the extent to which a public debate embodies freedom, we then have to ask:

Who gets to speak and who does not? Who is listened to and who is not? Who is

respected and who is not? Who is considered to be our equal and who is considered

inferior? Who can be trusted to tell the truth and to seek the truth and who not? Who is

committed to a resolution of the issues at stake and who would rather they not be

resolved? To what extent do online communication behaviours depart from the norms of

face-to-face communication? To all of these questions we would have to append 'Why?',

if we are interested in freeing freedom from its shackles.

Freedom is not a pure substance, easily distilled from its social context and other social

values, easily defined as something pure and simple. In our time we now know that

granting unfettered 'freedom of speech' to individuals can lead to lies and deception

rather than truth and knowledge (contra J S Mill) and injustice rather than justice. A free

public debate, I suggest then, is one where everyone (or a good cross-section of

everyone) who wants to is able to participate, is respected and listened to, and is

committed to telling the truth, seeking the truth and finding solutions to problems that

affect our common future.

In reality in Australia, of course, we don't have good public debates and we don't have

free public debates.

As Sky Croeser says: "In Australia access to a wide range of political ideas and diverse

engagement in political debate is, arguably, significantly undermined by media

centralisation and huge cuts to public broadcasting services." [Sky Croeser in 'Thinking

beyond 'free speech' in responding to online harassment', Ada New Media, Issue No. 10,

Nov 2016, <https://adanewmedia.org/>]

Social inequalities, bigotry and the dead weight of 'common sense' also play a role in

limiting whose perspectives are listened to, respected, amplified. Belittling of people

based on skin colour, gender, sexual preference or on their simply having unpopular

views (think climate scientists or epidemiologists recommending that we wear masks)

occurs frequently and effectively silences these people. Online harassment is notorious

for this.

Misinformation and disinformation are rife. Sources of 'the truth' are contested: science is

considered to be 'opinion', educated opinion is considered to be 'elite' opinion, anything

that departs from 'common sense' is met with ridicule rather than inquiry. People don't

make the effort to understand issues in depth and instead rely on soundbites, misleading

political advertising and other unreliable sources of information, which have been

allowed to proliferate under the banner of 'free speech'.

Anything that unjustifiably belittles people and makes them withdraw from the public

sphere has to be seen as deleterious to freedom in the public sphere or as an attack on

freedom of political communication as the case may be. 'Unjustifiably' can be defined as

'for reasons that can not withstand public scrutiny, i.e reasons like racism, bigotry

(religious or not), ignorance, deliberate deception or intimidation intended to suppress

the view of an opponent . Any social conditions that lead to the exclusion of certain

groups of people from the public sphere have to be seen likewise. Any participants in the

public sphere who undermine trust in communication in the public sphere through

promotion of misinformation or disinformation have also to be seen as corrosive of free

public debate, because they muddy the waters and stymie attempts to reach agreement

on a way forward, and because they betray our trust in them.

'The market' doesn't tolerate deception because it threatens money-making. ASIC is

onto it, to stamp it out, and rightly so. Society should not tolerate deception either,

because it threatens our society-making.

In working together to find solutions to the problems of our times, we need to agree to

constraints on one another’s behaviour, for our common good. In order to exist, freedom

needs social conditions that embody appropriate constraints. All successful

communication is based on rules, beginning with the rules of the language used to

communicate, and extending to the social norms and etiquette—all of which can be seen

as constraints—in place to allow people to navigate the world together. Measures that

ensure the maintenance and protection of those rules are the foundation stones of

freedom, not its enemy. Given the power and reach of the communications media today,

civil society is unable to implement such measures; only the state is able to do so.

**Other references that I found to be insightful:**

Zaphir and Ellerton sum it up well: "It is possible to have unlimited freedom of expression

— just not in a democracy. If someone can say what they want without any regard or

consequence, then they’ve merely reached the top of a dictatorship." [Luke Zaphir &

Peter Ellerton, 'Free speech doesn’t mean you can say whatever you want, wherever.

Here’s how to explain this to kids', The Conversation, 28 Sep 2021, available <here>.

Louise Richardson-Self: "What I’d like to do, though, is point out an often invisible

element of the “freedom of speech” defence. Specifically, that hate speech privileges

certain social groups, and completely unfettered speech – in the context of the West –

has a tendency to privilege men. It also privileges heterosexuals, able-bodied people,

white people, and secular (or moderately Christian) people, among others. And this

sustains hierarchies of oppression. ... To understand the harm of unrestricted speech, we

need to understand the workings of inequality in our society today, and (relatedly) have

an understanding of the history of subordination and privileging of certain groups."
