Re: The Truth NOT Misinformation and Disinformation
#### Submission : Can be made public. To whom it may concern. Any and all persons voting in support of this Bill are the persons who are petrified of being exposed by the truth of their complicity to bend true facts to their corruption agendas.. These people have already condemned themselves by writing into the proposed Bil
##### “the Bill explicitly exempts any government communication, of any level of
#### government, from being considered misinformation or disinformation”. This enforces a regime of suppression of any speech on social media that undermines government claims. Or in other words fascism. We the people will be heard loud and clear regardless. Exposing the manipulators of truth to a very premature political grave and that is not disinformation or misinformation. So will this new { ndependent ? } regulator “the Australian Communications and Media Authority {ACMA} be a true watchdog or a lapdog. They better choose wisely for they will be constantly under the peoples and certain politicians microscope of political double speak. Consequently this Bill must be placed where it belongs, IN THE BIN to be destroyed. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading the above and we remain respectfully yours.
##### Mr. John Kohl.
