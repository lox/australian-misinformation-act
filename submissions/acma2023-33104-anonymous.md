#### Dear Sir/Madam,

###### I am writing to express my deep concern

## for the democratic principles I and many
### others value.

#### Firstly, this bill creates a two-tier system,
### whereby politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions are granted the power to spread information, whether true or false, while regular members of society are subjected to strict regulations. How is this possibly okay!?

 This unjust distinction not only undermines the democratic ideals of our
## society but also hampers the power of

### Furthermore, the excessive fines imposed

 The broad industry-wide application of the code without any "pressure escape valves" only exacerbates the harm caused

## domination of a select few. Wrong on
### every level!

 The task of accurately distinguishing between true and false information is an
## impossible one, as new discoveries and

#### Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy
### Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His
## comment on Twitter raises doubts about

 Moreover, the reliance on industry bodies, which are often influenced by major players in their respective industries, poses a significant risk to the competition among digital platforms. The potential for the largest services to create onerous codes that hinder smaller competitors is a

 Additionally, the extraterritorial reach of

 Furthermore, the threats posed to digital

#### Lastly, the proposed bill contradicts the

### The limitations placed on digital platforms

##### In conclusion, the Communications

###### I urge the Department of Infrastructure,

 If any bill is required it should be

 Thank you for considering my feedback. I
