Feedback Submission on exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I have serious concerns about this new Bill to combat Misinformation and Disinformation as
I believe it impinges on Freedom of Speech.

The Government is not fit to be the arbiter of what is or is not Truth. Indeed Truth at one
point in history may not be Truth at another point in time.

A person’s Truth is their Opinion on any matter and to have progress in society and all
checks and balances in place to prevent over regulation, it is necessary to be able to state,
share and debate various opinions about many matters to come to informed decisions.

As a nation we have always been able to speak freely and honestly (other than during the
Covid pandemic when freedom of speech and information was curtailed under the guise of
being misinformation and disinformation) and there is not now or ever has been a need for
this Bill to curtail our basic right of Freedom of Speech.

Misinformation and disinformation does not pose any threat to the safety and well being of
Australians. We are not children or people of diminished capacity who need to be
protected from ourselves, but rather thinking adults capable to making our own decisions
from all the information we glean from various sources. We do not need the Government
to disseminate “appropriate” information to us.

Yours sincerely,

Annamari Kilpinen
