# Submission on the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (‘the Bill’)

There are 2 dimensions to the management of commentary on digital pla�orms. The first is the
protec�on of the right to free and fair comment (that is non-harmful). The second is the preven�on
of harm caused by misinforma�on and disinforma�on. The Bill addresses only one of these
dimensions: the preven�on of harm caused by misinforma�on and disinforma�on. It does not offer
any protec�ons for legi�mate fair comment.

While it is necessary and appropriate to restrict the spreading of misinforma�on and disinforma�on
it is equally necessary to prevent the misuse or misapplica�on of these terms to remove fair
comment or to de-pla�orm commentators who post fair comment. The Bill should seek to not only
prevent the spread of misinforma�on and disinforma�on but also seek to prevent the misuse,
misinterpreta�on or misapplica�on of these terms to limit free and fair comment that is nonharmful.

The opportunity afforded by the Bill is not only to manage the risk of harm caused the spread of
misinforma�on and disinforma�on but also to demonstrate to the Australian popula�on a
commitment to the protec�on of free speech and fair comment.[1]

It noted that ACMA plays no role in determining the provisions within voluntary industry codes and
the industry is not required by the Bill to adopt the defini�ons in the Bill. This posi�on is not
considered conducive to the consistent and fair interpreta�on or applica�on of the terms
misinforma�on and disinforma�on.[2]

This submission proposes changes to the Bill that seek to address these concerns.

1 _The Fact Sheet notes the disrup�on of health responses as an example of the concerns that the Bill seeks to address._
_However, the COVID19 pandemic experience provides an example of the harm that can be caused by inappropriate_
_interpreta�on of the terms “false, misleading and decep�ve”. Content was removed from digital pla�orms, and a number_
_of highly qualified commentators were de-pla�ormed (some at the request of government departments), for challenging_
_the asser�on by medical authori�es that COVID vaccines were effec�ve in stopping or significantly reducing the_
_transmission of the COVID19 virus. The contrarian views of the de-pla�ormed commentators, a number of whom were_
_eminently qualified medical prac��oners, were deemed to be misinforma�on (variously asserted to be false, misleading and_
_/or decep�ve) and considered harmful to the community. As is now known and proven, the vaccines were not effec�ve in_
_reducing the transmission of the virus. The restric�on of fair comment by experienced prac��oners arguably resulted in_
_harm to the popula�on of healthy, young Australians who were not at material risk from the virus but were exposed to the_
_risk of complica�ons from the vaccines such as myocardi�s and pericardi�s._

_This example highlights the fact that there is also a risk of harm posed by the inappropriate, erroneous or deliberate_
_classifica�on of informa�on as misinforma�on. While authori�es may have been ac�ng in good faith in asser�ng that the_
_COVID vaccines were effec�ve in stopping transmission, the ‘shu�ng down’ of contrarian viewpoints from learned experts_
_was clearly wrong and harmful to those young Australians who developed complica�ons from the vaccines. While the Bill_
_may not have prevented these events from occurring due to the government sponsorship of the inaccurate asser�on_
_regarding vaccines, the Bill should seek to prevent similar outcomes by facilita�ng free and fair comment that is non-_
_harmful, however controversial that comment may be._

2 _The proposed regime appears to leave considerable scope for individual service providers to adopt their own interpreta�on_
_of misinforma�on or disinforma�on, a risk which is exacerbated by an industry standard that does not adopt the Bill’s_
_defini�ons. Some industry par�cipants have, in the past, demonstrated a propensity to define content that is inconsistent_
_with their views as misinforma�on or to remove content for other corporate reasons (such as the removal of news content_
_by Facebook in February 2021)_

**1.** **The Bill should combat not only misinforma�on and disinforma�on, it should also combat the**

**restric�on of free speech by misuse, misinterpreta�on or misapplica�on of these terms**

The Bill provides an opportunity to ins�l or restore confidence in the consistent applica�on of the
principles of free speech in this country by not only comba�ng misinforma�on and disinforma�on
but also by addressing the misuse of these terms by individual service providers to limit, restrict or
preclude free speech.

As such the Bill should:

- require that any code of conduct must include provisions that preclude the removal of content or
de-pla�orming of a contributor unless the informa�on posted is demonstrated to be
misinforma�on or disinforma�on, and likely to cause serious harm; and

- enable content providers to appeal against the decision of a service provider to remove content
or de-pla�orm them where they believe the informa�on that has been removed is not
misinforma�on or disinforma�on (item 3 below provides further comments on the right of
appeal and the appeal process); and

- require service providers to provide ACMA with a monthly/ quarterly report detailing measures
implemented by the provider to respond to misinforma�on or disinforma�on including the
iden�ty of the contributor, the nature of the content of the informa�on, the ac�on taken by the
service provider and the reasons for the ac�ons taken by the service provider (including the
reasons why the informa�on is considered to be misinforma�on or disinforma�on. This will
enable ACMA to monitor unilateral ac�ons by service providers and to determine if the ac�ons
being taken are reasonable and consistent with the intent of the legisla�on.[3]

If it is reasonable to assert that misinforma�on and disinforma�on should be controlled by the
legisla�on to avoid serious harm it is equally reasonable to assert that the misuse or misapplica�on
of these terms to limit fair comment and free speech (that is not harmful) should also be controlled
by the legisla�on. [4]

3 _I note clause 14 of the dra� legisla�on but this only says that digital pla�orm rules may require certain ac�ons rela�ng to_
_record keeping and repor�ng. I believe the legisla�on should require regular repor�ng as described above to aid in_
_preven�on of abuse of free speech by individual service providers_
4 _In the US_ _there have been numerous reports of digital service providers de-pla�orming poli�cal figures and others_
_expressing legi�mate views considered to be contrary to the views of the service provider. These ac�ons have o�en been_
_taken under the auspices of removing misinforma�on or disinforma�on when, in reality, they reflected only the_
_inconsistency of the content with the views of the management of the service provider._

**2.** **The Bill should provide defini�ons and interpre�ve guidance with respect to the terms “false”,**

**“misleading” and “decep�ve”**

The proposed legisla�on is intended to control the dissemina�on of misinforma�on and
disinforma�on that may result in substan�al harm. The defini�ons of “misinforma�on” and
“disinforma�on” are founded on 3 cri�cal terms:

1. False
2. Misleading
3. Decep�ve

The interpreta�on of these 3 terms is cri�cal to the outcomes that will result from the Bill. However,
the Bill, as dra�ed, does not define these terms and provides no guidance on the interpreta�on of
these terms. In the absence of a clear defini�on of each, and guidance as to how they are to be
interpreted and applied, there is:

- The likelihood that social, cultural, poli�cal or religious bias within the management of individual
digital service providers or ACMA[4] will influence the interpreta�on of these terms; and

- a high probability that there will be differing standards applied by pla�orms; and, as a
_consequence of the above_

- a high risk that these terms may not be properly, fairly and consistently interpreted.

The absence of a clear defini�on and interpre�ve guidance with respect to these terms poten�ally
facilitates highly subjec�ve interpreta�on. In par�cular, the words “misleading” and “decep�ve” are
open to a range of subjec�ve interpreta�ons, leading to the risk of bias based on the social, cultural,
poli�cal, or religious views of the decision makers of the pla�orm, or alterna�vely, ACMA[5].
Addi�onally, the absence of guidance on the meaning and interpreta�on of these terms allows for
inconsistencies in their interpreta�on as between individual pla�orms.

The lack of a�en�on to these cri�cal terms can be contrasted with the treatment of the term “harm”,
which is a defined term in the legisla�on and one for which addi�onal interpre�ve guidance is
provided in sec�on 7(3).

While it might be argued that these terms can be defined in the code of conduct, these terms are so
integral to the applica�on of the legisla�on that confidence and trust in the legisla�on can only be
achieved if they are defined in the legisla�on and guidance is provided in the interpreta�on of these
terms. Further, if the term “harm” warrants defining and guidance in the legisla�on, the same should
be true for the terms “false”, “misleading” and “decep�ve”.

_5 While the fact sheet advises that the ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed from_
_digital platform services, the Bill allows ACMA (in certain circumstances) to direct service providers to comply with a code of_
_conduct approved by ACMA. As such ACMA will have the power to request the removal of specific content where the_
_content is considered by ACMA to be in breach of the code of conduct. In these circumstances ACMA will have the power to_
_unilaterally decide if content is misinformation or disinformation and to require removal of content so determined_

**3.** **The Bill should contain a right of appeal or require any code of conduct to include a right of**

**appeal**

The Bill facilitates ACMA’s inves�ga�on of complaints regarding non-compliance with codes or
standards by service providers but does not contemplate complaints rela�ng to inappropriate
removal of informa�on or de-pla�orming of individuals.

To minimise the risk of service providers removing content or de-pla�orming commentators without
due process and/ or due to subjec�ve and possibly biased views of the service provider, the Bill
should require that any code of conduct:

- enable content providers who have their content removed, or who are de-pla�ormed, to appeal
to the service provider (in the first instance) where they believe that:

`o` the informa�on that has been removed is not misinforma�on or disinforma�on, or
`o` their de-pla�orming has been based on misinterpreta�on, misuse or misapplica�on of

the terms misinforma�on or disinforma�on

- require service providers to provide a wri�en response to any appeal within a strict �meframe
including reasons for the decision

- provide that content providers who are unhappy with the advice of the service provider to
appeal to ACMA[6]

- give ACMA the power to require a service provider to restore content that is not demonstrably
misinforma�on or disinforma�on[5]

6 _Alterna�vely, the Bill should require that any code of conduct contain a right of appeal to an independent arbiter against_
_decisions made by service providers and provide the arbiter to require:_

   - _the reinstatement of informa�on that is consistent with the legisla�on, or_

   - _re-pla�orming of the individual, or_

   - _payment of compensa�on_
