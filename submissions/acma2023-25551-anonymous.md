Reference: Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
# Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Thank you for the opportunity to provide my concerns regarding the referenced Draft Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I disagree with the Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and request it be withdrawn. I have a number of concerns with this Bill, the_
primary is that this Bill fails to define who determines the misinformation/disinformation or what is
considered misinformation/disinformation.

The use of Digital Platform Services is the most prolific method of public communication and debate
today. There is only one truth and the Government is not the sole holder of that truth. Had the
Government never made a mistake, lied or mislead the people then this Bill MAY have merit. In its
current form this Bill hinders freedom of expression and hence hinders the development of new
concepts and ideas. The impact of this Bill will be felt in areas such as science, politics, education, health
and business simply because people will no longer feel safe to disagree with someone’s interpretation of
truth while using digital services.

This country has a democratically elected Government and while it is the Government’s responsibility to
provide what it believes to be the truth it must be up to the people to decide for themselves what is
disinformation and misinformation. This Bill provides the ability for the ACMA to suppress the people’s
ability to disagree with the Government. A government that suppresses the right to speak out in a public
forum is a government without accountability. While accountability ensures a healthy, functioning
society that is free to debate and develop acceptable truths a lack of accountability in Government leads
to a Socialist and/or Communist government and ultimately the suppression of truth.

On numerous occasions history has shown us that the ‘truths’ held by the Government of the time were
dangerous, inhumane, and ultimately shown to be wrong. One example amongst many is the policies,
the ‘truths’, held by the Government prior to the 1960s which dehumanised Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples. The very people who spoke against these supposed truths and ultimately brought
about changes, under this Bill, would be branded as propagators of misinformation and disinformation.
How can our country progress with suppression orders like those considered in this Bill?

So, who can be trusted to determine what is misinformation and disinformation? Just one example
where leading academics, a trusted group of society, simply got it wrong is that of Hungarian physician
Ignaz Semmelweis. In the 19[th] centenary Semmelweis had the ‘audacity’ to suggest that a doctor should
wash his hands before aiding a mother in child birth. Today we stand on this side of history with no way
of knowing how many lives Semmelweis saved. He was ridiculed by his colleagues for his work linking
handwashing to better medical care and they had him committed to an asylum because these academics
refused to accept the truth. Had Semmelweis lived in the digital age he would have used a digital
platform to spread his message of ‘disinformation’ and under this Bill would have received 12 months in
jail or a fine of up to $550,000.

How can Australia continue to progress if organisations and individuals fear speaking out, making
controversial statements or disagree with the Government? How will we develop as a society if we can’t
publicly, using digital media, disagree with the Government’s version of the ‘truth’? Is it not every
person’s right to have, and share, their opinion in any way and using whatever media they want? A
person who society has deemed a liar is not necessarily also deemed a criminal, if that were the case,
unfortunately, many of our politicians would be jailed and fined.

I appeal for the sake of Australia and the freedom of her people that this Bill be withdrawn in its current
