The importance of free speech.

Freedom of Speech and the ability to hear speech and make up one's own mind about
informafion is a basic Human Right. Crifical Thinking is exercised when a person takes the
fime to hear all informafion and use deducfive reasoning, Truth and Facts to make their own
surmise about a parficular issue or subject.
Informafion, whether true, factual, culturally acceptable, or not is vital to the process of
crifical thinking. Debate between people with differences in opinion, regardless how
offensive it may seem is an important part of the community and needs to be protected and
respected because people need to be able to have conversafion and debate about difficult
issues in order for the formafion of ideas, and cultural change to occur. Healthy debate is
something that must be talk like good manners.
A nafion in which people are limited by the law as to what can be spoken is a nafion which is
governed by totalitarianism. People will always want to talk and discuss issues that are
important to themselves and their families and communifies. This bill will only drive that
conversafion underground.
