Dear Committee members,

**Submission**

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

One of the fundamental problems with the concept of a small group of people, often with vested
interests, being in a position to decide what is correct information and what is incorrect information is
that it assumes that they know what they are talking about and have proper scientific proof and no
agenda of their own.

Not so long ago that it should be forgotten and the lesson ignored, is that the general belief and
government narrative was that the sun rotated around the earth. Those that dared to suggest that it
was an oblate spheroid, even with scientific proof supporting them, were called names, discredited and
gagged and in the case of “the world rotates around the sun and not the other way around”, even
threatened with fines and death --- By the government. Some other, better known cases are
(Expanded information is found below with references as shown):

  - Expansive cosmology Ref 1 Below

  - Handwashing in medical settings Ref 2

  - Continental drift Ref 3

  - Thalidomide Tragedy Ref 4

  - Controversial Medical Treatments Ref 5

  - Amalgam Tooth fillings Ref 6

As with many of these and notably “Thalidomide”, the sad thing is, after the truth is exposed, the
politicians say “This must never be allowed to happen again” and yet, here we are about to legislate to
‘Legally’ negate opposing ideas and yet another fundamental right --- the right to freedom of speech
goes down the drain. If these authoritarianism style governments’ laws were in place from the 1600’s,
we’d still have a flat Earth and the sun would rotate around us and we’d be dosing pregnant females
with Thalidomide. But we’re no better even now, forcing people to partake in the use of an untested
mRNA technology and this is after saying “the use of such experimental drugs must never be allowed to
happen again”.

A free and open press and freedom to the people is a fundamental cornerstone of democracy. Without
it we have tyranny, no better than some world governments that our government criticises.

The above “bullet point” examples demonstrate that resistance to new scientific ideas can come from
various sources, including religious institutions, rival scientists, professional establishments, and societal
norms. In some cases, the initial opposition can be severe, leading to personal, professional, or even
legal consequences for the scientists or people involved. However, many of these scientific ideas have
been validated and became integral to our understanding of the world; yet this law seeks to prevent this
ongoing awakening and the exposure of dangerous practices.

Unfortunately, largely due to the tremendous pressure from a few very rich and powerful people and
corporations like big pharma, WHO, the UN and so on, governments are no longer governing for the
people guided by scientifically based support, but rather seem dominated by these powerful lobby
groups.

Lobbing and political donations MUST be stopped as well, as it inevitably leads to corruption.

Our government and media now dish out arguments that are groundless and emotionally charged to
sway the people, and those that oppose the narrative, are demonized. Opposing views are dismissed
and proper scientific data ignored and mocked along with personal attacks on the exponents – History

repeating itself. What is gained by this? It makes a very few people and corporations richer and richer
while destroying democracy and maiming, destroying the lives, and even killing millions of innocent
people.

This Bill is primarily in favour of the non-scientific and certainly not peer reviewed mock studies that
are paid for by the very vested interests and technocrats that gain from it. As silly as it is, even our
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is largely funded and therefore controlled by big pharma. This
emotional onslaught has replaced proper science and debate. “Control the narrative and you control
the people”. This of course means, don’t let opposing views reach the people else they may see the
truth. If we’ve learned anything from history, it’s that we learn nothing from history.

If the government intends to give power to a small group of bureaucrats and technocrats, to veto,
apply huge fines and direct jail sentences, then it seems only fair and democratic that they must prove
their version of the matter is correct BEFORE taking any action including pulling the article or whatever
they deem appropriate. Also before any action, they must prove that the person airing an alternative
view was beyond reasonable doubt, deliberately causing trouble – but this won’t happen because
there is rarely any proper justices in such matters unless the Press get hold of it.

The right way to further mankind and work with the people rather than the current work against:

As history shows, forcing people to accept the government narrative on all matters without proper
explanation and scientific debate eventually leads to rebellion. This is especially true when there is so
much credible opposing scientific support and research that supports the opposing view.

The best way to shut down erroneous views is by discrediting them by proving the other view. This can
only be done through the intelligent process of proper, and importantly, open debate --- What’s the
government afraid of?

Rather than gagging people and denying their right to free speech which only causes anger and
disquiet, I believe that open, clear, transparent, honest and public debate is the way to go. This will
insure public harmony as a consensus will be reached. It will also provide a much more effective
combat to misinformation whether such misinformation is from the public, government or vested
organizations.

It may be argued that this would be an expensive approach but considering the destructive course of
events, the sins against the countries citizens and the destruction of confidence in our governing
bodies, open, honest and fair debate is cheap and much more effective and so, the only intelligent
path.

It is important however, that both sides of such debate, must be supported by credible, non-involved
scientists in the relevant areas or other sources of sound evidence from anywhere. This is governing
for the people as it leads to protecting their rights and safety while achieving the best scientific
practice. People pushing incorrect conspiracy ideas, will naturally whither due to a lack of supportable
fuel.

No matter what, under our constitution and innate human rights, any individual or group must not be
threatened with fines, jail sentences or any other punitive instrument for exercising their fundamental
right to voice and opinion and debate an issue.

All open discussions and influential material MUST be balanced, both views must have equal
opportunity to reach the citizens unlike the current VOICE, the mRNA Jab, the heavy handed treatment
during the so called COVID pandemic, global climate change and more debacles which are clearly bias
in so many ways. The way to clear the huge unease in these matters, is by the process of open and
honest discussion tightly chaired by a senior and respected chairman --- not shutting down freedoms
and debate.

Already whistle blowers are vilified whereas they should be commended and celebrated as they are
helping to rid us of the wide spread and serious corruption – Isn’t this a good thing? Apparently not.

For the welfare and prosperity of Australia and Australians, the “Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023”, must be rejected in its
entirety and I beseech your understanding.

Yours Faithfully

1. Giordano Bruno: Bruno, an Italian philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer, proposed an

expansive cosmology that included the idea of an infinite universe with countless inhabited
worlds. His views contradicted the beliefs of the time, and he was accused of heresy. In 1600,
Bruno was burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition.

2. Ignaz Semmelweis: Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, is known as the "saviour of mothers"

for his pioneering work on handwashing in medical settings. In the mid-19th century, he
discovered that proper hand hygiene could dramatically reduce the incidence of childbirth
fever, but his ideas were met with skepticism and resistance from the medical establishment.
Semmelweis faced professional rejection, ridicule, and ultimately suffered a mental
breakdown.

3. Alfred Wegener: Wegener, a German meteorologist, proposed the theory of continental drift in

the early 20th century, suggesting that the Earth's continents were once joined together in a
single landmass and had gradually moved apart. However, his ideas were met with strong
resistance and scepticism from the invested ‘scientific’ community.

4. Thalidomide Tragedy: In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the drug thalidomide was widely

prescribed as a sedative and anti-nausea medication, particularly to pregnant women.
However, it was later discovered that thalidomide caused severe birth defects in thousands of
children. This tragedy highlighted the importance of rigorous testing and regulatory oversight in
the pharmaceutical industry and led to significant reforms in drug safety regulations.

5. Controversial Medical Treatments: There have been instances where medical treatments or

interventions were promoted or used without sufficient scientific evidence or rigorous testing.
These practices can put patients at risk and undermine evidence-based medicine. Eg: mRNA.

6. Amalgam Controversy: The use of dental amalgam, a mixture of mercury and other metals, as a

dental filling material has been a subject of controversy. Concerns have been raised regarding
potential health risks associated with mercury exposure.
