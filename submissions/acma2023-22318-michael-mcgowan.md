Submission to ACMA -14[th] July, 2023 – Dr Michael McGowan

Australian men and women have died and suffered over 100 years fighfing against tyranny to
preserve our freedoms. The federal government has no right to either significantly reduce, or take
away any of these fundamental rights of a democrafically consfituted nafion. There are already
effecfive laws in place to prevent vilificafion, slander and malicious statements being made. Further,
in the proposed Bill the definifions of misinformafion and disinformafion are far too broad, and thus
there is a very real risk that if this Bill was passed it would severely limit free speech in the Australian
community. Having as one of the criteria ‘anything considered by ACMA that may cause harm to the
Australian environment’ demonstrates how blatantly the current federal government is prepared to
use legislafion to drive their own ideologies. Finally, why should polificians be exempt from this
proposed Bill. The failure of polificians to recognise that when you give your word on something you
stand by it and take full responsibility for all consequences is a blight on Australian society.
