I am totally against any government department or individual censoring my speech on any issue. It can NOT be up
to any individual especially a government paid employee, deciding what is right or wrong in anything that anyone in
a free society has to say. We, the people, are not stupid and can decide for ourselves what is mis and disinformation
especially as the government is usually the one to post their propaganda in their efforts to control our society. The
recent COVID debacle is one such issue that the government should be ashamed of as people have DIED because of
the illegal mandates forced on the public. I believe if freedom of choice, it is our God given right and no man,
government or business has the right to take this from us. I now have a year old nephew who has a permanent,
chronic heart condition after having the booster COVID shot as has now been recognised by the federal government
as his submission for SOME support threw Centrelink has been accepted. I looked at the pharmaceutical web site in
May 2020 and saw for myself the exemptions that the manufactures said were NOT recommended to have the
COVID shot which included those with heart, or lung diseases, those on blood thinners, children under 12, pregnant
women and anyone who had anaphylactic reactions for any other medications. I was exempt but could I get an
authorised government exemption - NO. My doctor was warned if he gave me one he would have his licence
revoked. Truth that under this legislation would mor than likely be seen as mis or disinformation. This is
unacceptable and should not proceed. I am disgusted with the amount of control this current government is
determined to introduce to stop we, the people, from having our say. The Voice referendum will be adversely
effected as a direct result of this coming into force as those who stand against this will be silenced. To exempt the
government from any such restrictions is draconian, and shows we are going into a dictatorship form of government.
Shame on all who support this travesty. Yours sincerely

Dianne Cowling
