I have resubmitted this to include my contact details and I give permission for my submission to be made available and
printed in full for the public.

**To whom it may concern**

I recently printed off to read for myself the three documents:

Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation) Bill 2023;
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation) Bill 2023 Guidance Note June
2023; and
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation) Bill 2023 Fact Sheet June 2023

Unfortunately, I didn’t have to read very far into the Fact Sheet and Guidance Note to find that these two documents
themselves contained statements of Misinformation and Disinformation.

I am referring to one of the Examples of serious harm:

“Misinformation that caused people to ingest or inject bleach products to treat a viral infection”

This example itself is based on false and misleading statements made by someone that wanted to deliberately slander the
actual product and source of information. Then “professional news”, Health Officers and Politicians parroted and
broadcasted the misinformation and disinformation themselves without doing their own independent research.

The product is called MMS (Master Mineral Solution) and there are a number of publications about this product. Please refer
to attachments A, B and C, which are:

A. The front cover of a book called MMS Health Recovery Guidebook;

B. The Publisher’s page of the same book. This book in particular dates back to 2015; and
C. The first page of the Disclaimer of the same book which very clearly states what the product MMS is and is not.

On the first page of the disclaimer, it states:
“MMS 1 and MMS2 are oxidizers that destroy poisons and kill pathogens by oxidation. MMS2 (hypochlorous acid [HOCI] is the
same oxidizer that the human immune system generates in order to destroy pathogens and poisons…A great deal of evidence
given by the FDA, EPA and various industrial corporations prove scientifically that MMS1 (chlorine dioxide) kills and/or
oxidizes pathogens and poisons in food, public water systems, hospitals, and even slaughter houses. It is our belief that the
same thing can and does happen in the human body.

Anecdotal evidence from thousands of people around the world indicates that there is little doubt MMS1 (chlorine dioxide)
and MMS2 (when dissolved in water turns to hypochlorous acid [HOCI] have the ability to kill pathogens and/or oxidize
poisons in the human body. The FDA regulations specify that chlorine dioxide (MMS1) and calcium hypochlorite (MMS2) can
be used in public water systems to purify the water, and chlorine dioxide is used to preserve vegetables, meat and other
items. The human body on an average is 60-75% water. It stands to reason that chlorine dioxide can also purify the water in
the body just as it does in public water systems. Once the water of the body is purified, and many of the poisons oxidized,
the body can then heal the body.”

I personally took the attached photos, as this book has been sitting in my bookshelf since 2016. I have personally read the
book from cover to cover, which is why I personally know that the statement “Misinformation that caused people to ingest or
inject bleach products to treat a viral infection”, is a false and misleading statement. Nowhere in the guidebook does it say to
inject MMS directly into the body. It has very specific protocols to follow when taking MMS internally and putting the MMS in
a bath and having a bath.

I personally have had MMS in my first aid kit for over a decade now and I have used it on occasions when I have had a virus or
an infection that is pathogen based, such as a coronavirus. When taken as recommended, it works.

I have many grave doubts, concerns and questions surrounding this Bill, when an example given in the Fact Sheet and Guide
Note is Misinformation and Disinformation by the Bill’s own definition. The deliberate slandering and falsifying information
the product MMS was only done to propagate a lie about MMS to disway the public from its true source and function. This is
harming the public by the Bill’s own definition of harm Had the public been told the truth about MMS and its many

Further, the Bill excludes “professional news content”, content authorized by the Australian or a State, Territory or Local
Government, when it was these very people who parroted and spread the Misinformation and Disinformation about MMS.

Instead, the people who spread the Misinformation and Disinformation about MMS, whilst they may not have created it
personally, they did not investigate properly nor undertake any due diligence about MMS, are exempt.

Why is that? This question must be answered.

And this is just one of the examples that I personally know that is false and misleading.

I now have serious concerns about the rest of the examples and the true intend behind this Bill.

Therefore, it is my will, that this Bill does not go through parliament or any other Bill that addresses misinformation and
disinformation whereby the very people who the Bill protects are in fact spreaders of misinformation and disinformation.
