# Comments and position on draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (to be referred to here as the draft ACMA Bill)

**Short statement**

I do not consent to and strongly oppose any form of censorship. Censorship has no place in a free and
democratic society. The cornerstone of a democratic society is freedom of engagement and discussion to
facilitate understanding and diplomacy.

**Reasons why I do not consent to the ACMA Bill**

My concerns with the draft ACMA Bill relate to:

  - Threats to Freedom of Speech: There is a high risk that our fundamental right to freedom of speech
would be infringed upon, despite the assurances of this draft ACMA Bill. By granting a
regulatory/advisory body (such as ACMA) the power to determine what is
misinformation/disinformation, and to enforce codes of practice/industry standards, it is highly likely
that legitimate speech and differing viewpoints will be suppressed.

  - Potential for overreach: As the definitions of misinformation and disinformation provided in the Bill
are subjective and open to interpretation, this creates an ‘open-ended’ level of discretion that could
stifle legitimate public debate and discourse. It also paves the way for certain views/discussions to be
censored subject to pressure from special interest groups (such as stakeholders within the WHO)

  - Privacy and data security at risk: By giving ACMA (or any other regulatory/advisory body) the power
to collect our digital data from digital platform providers, in addition to the lack of clarity on what
constitutes "serious harm" enables the potential abuse of power.

  - Anti-competitive environment: Digital innovation, particularly from smaller platforms and startups
would be disproportionately affected from the additional compliance requirements and potential
regulatory burdens being imposed upon them. These smaller platforms/startups do not have the
financial/human resources that larger established platforms do.

**Comments on Exposure Draft Bill**

The following below is a case study of the control of misinformation/disinformation gone wrong:

  - The Government announced a package of measures to communicate the safe and effective message
during the Covid-19 pandemic aimed specifically at the Australian media. No other treatments, or
positive health messages were broadcast, only a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to sars-cov2.

  - Citizens bodily autonomy and informed consent were removed. Australians were informed by the
then Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the said vaccines were not mandatory but clearly the states
were given the task of making them mandatory (this has undermined trust in Government). This was
made more obvious with Greg Hunt (former minister for health and aged care) stating:

`o` “The world is engaged in the largest clinical trial, the largest global vaccination trial ever”

media event date:21 February 2021

  - The items (see dot points below) at the start of the pandemic could and have been removed off
social media platforms at the bequest of Government and are now if not entirely true. Which begs
the questions who within ACMA decides what truth is and what is not truth?

  - Items that have been removed:

`o` The Covid Vaccines are recognised as Gene Technologies

         - “In collaboration with biotech company Beam Therapeutics, Pfizer scientists are
developing mRNA technology as a new approach to gene editing, a form of gene
therapy.”

`o` The said vaccines are not safe and not effective.
```
     o

```
`o` Senators voted against an investigation into excess deaths (Why?), all data is sourced from

the Australian Government. More interestingly is the death rate fell in Australia in 2020
before the said vaccine rollout, then climb alarmingly in 2021 post vaccination.

**Summary of concerns**

  - Who decides what is and is not mis/dis information?

  - The Government itself is exempt (leaves room for overreach and lack of accountability)

  - The Australian Government is outsourcing its public health responses to the WHO a non-government
organisation heavily sponsored by the .

  - made billions through during the pandemic (conflict of

interest)

  - Censorship is a direct attack on freedom and liberty of Australians and only further centralises power
to a few within Government. The Government work for and are paid by the people of Australia. The
power lies with the Australian People not the Government.
