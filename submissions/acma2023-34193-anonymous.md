_Disinformation) Bill 2023_

Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts:

This submission is to present concerns and state opposition to the _Communications Legislation_
_Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, with a scope that includes_
online platforms, and proposes financial penalties or even imprisonment, if remarks are made
contrary to the opinions of those acting in the role of government in Australia.

This proposed Bill has capacity to trample the freedom of speech of all Australians underfoot and is
another step in obvious moves by the Albanese administration to continue existing measure to align
this nation with the globalist agenda being implemented lockstep with other nations, such as Canada.
It is important the Albanese administration understand the Australian people can see through this
globalist socialism-aligned Bill, which plays into the classic strategies of a communist state.

These keys include:

  - Division of the people through “them and us” tactics, such as “The Voice” referendum based
on the twenty-seven page “one page” treaty the Albanese administration has promised to
fully implement “if” the proposal gain support at the referendum, if that process can be
trusted. The increasing evidence of dishonesty throughout this process, which is supposed to
accurately represent the many diverse mobs of our capable, culturally rich Aboriginal peoples,
is highly concerning.

  - Erasing freedoms is another essential step to establishing a socialist regime and is designed to
wear down, enslave and control the people through measures that could be encompassed by
the digital/biometrics identity legislation introduced by the Morrison government and the
proposed digital centralised currency. The NSW government revealed further steps in the
proposed extension of this control in the form of digital voting, signalling further manipulation
of the election preferences of voting-age Australians. This is not to say there aren’t existing
questions over the process in this nation already, but we’ve seen where this has led in other
nations, now under control of “ever re-elected” dictators or subject to illegitimate
administrations.

  - Breakdown of traditional family and identity through pervasive and intentional attacks on
marriage, family, sexuality and indoctrination of children with these ideals, especially to set
children against parents and traditionally held values. This agenda has been actively advanced
for multiple decades now, with our children being the greatest victims in this process.

  - Control of Speech and information sharing is a pillar for solidifying socialist measures to ensure
effective indoctrination and silencing of any usurpers or questions about government
decisions. That’s where this proposed Bill comes in with potential to support the above
measures.

The Albanese administration may have been positioned to implement additional steps towards the
globalist agenda, such as the WHO treaty, but we the Australian people state this stops now and all
that has been enacted towards enslaving us to this globalist end goal is to be undone. The Australian
people are not for sale. Many Australians recognise what is going on and administrations actively
implementing these globalists agendas will be held to account.

The suggestion that government administrations are the embodiment of truth and thus the authority
on deciding what is “fact” in the public (and private) sphere is beyond arrogant. This absurdity is

magnified when one considers the debacle of “scientific experts” advising the nation over the past
few years. In such an environment of censorship many things die. Were this Bill to be implemented
this would include real science, religious freedoms, honest healthcare, holistic education and other
key elements of family and society.

Recent years have given the Australian people a clear example of what such a Bill may look like in
action as we’ve seen the opposite of science touted from the highest authorities at a State and Federal
level, while the mainstream media watchdog acted as barking echoes of these “disinformation”
accusations. This was despite these administration-authorised statements being in direct conflict with
recognised science on matters of natural immunity, inefficacy of mask/respirator wearing to prevent
respiratory virus transmission, the overwhelming harm of lockdowns, and denial of safe, cheap and
effective treatments, which had been well characterised in published, peer-reviewed literature against
SARS-CoV-1, MERS and other viruses years in advance of the dissemination of the lab-manipulated
virus. The suspicious nature of the virus as a lab-manipulated entity was also identified early in the
timeframe by an Australian research group and submitted as a study with delayed publication and a
peculiar lack of interest by mainstream media – just as they remain absurdly disinterested on other
pertinent topics in this vein.

These examples are if nothing else embarrassing, but were be followed by many more, including the
blatant decimation of freedoms, careers and population health in relation to the experimental
transfection injections and the insanity of mass “vaccination” (if it were) in the middle of a viral
outbreak. Real scientists were and are still being silenced as “disinformation” spreaders on many of
these issues. Even on of the first voices (an acclaimed internationally renowned vaccinologist) to raise
the alarm on myocarditis and spike-protein shedding was silenced as “disinformation” by government
authorities and media platforms under government directives – just as “Meta” has acknowledged
being directed to actively silence posts questioning “The Voice” while promoting positive posts.

Now there is this censorship amendment Bill with potential to silence anyone who questions financial
decisions (could this include moves to discontinue cash and thus implement a centralised digital
currency?), climate “science” (science is the open debate of ideas, not the politicisation, censorship
and exclusion of countering evidence), other health directives, and more related to the dot-point
issues canvassed above. All these are conversations that should be openly and honestly debated, not
tiptoed around based on administrative preferences.

An effective way to counter “disinformation” is by illuminating truth and supporting this with genuine
evidence. A counter approach to this Bill would be crediting Australians with the capacity to
intelligently discern such information. Instead of gagging, open debate and honest admission of
unknowns and knowledge gaps would be significantly more beneficial.

Australians are not administration pawns and those legitimately in positions of government are
elected to work for the people. “For” in this context being decisions that promote freedom, life,
affluence, unity, health and family to strengthen society, not undermine it. All these matters directly
or indirectly come under the scope of this Bill and were this submission passed, would open the door
to highly subjective government criteria and authoritarian-type censorship akin to that of the CCP.

Citing the above reasons this submission calls for the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 to be suspended from further
advancement in the legislative process.
