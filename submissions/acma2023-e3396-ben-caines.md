To whom it may concern,

Please register my stronger opposition to this bill and any similar proposals.

I reject the bill and offer the follow as reasons for its rejection by parliament.

PHILOSOPHICAL
This bill lacks any philosophical foundation. The thrust of the framework appears to be attempting to prevent the
spread of harmful information. In practice, this would essentially amount to an attempt to legislate truth, and prohibit
publication of non-truth. This is thoroughly baseless in contemporary Australia which has rejected the idea of truth or
any agreed moral or philosophical baseline. The bill should be rejected.

SCIENTIFIC/MEDICAL
The story of science, including medical science, is the story of change. Each successive generation builds of its
forebears to give greater knowledge and technological progress to the world. Looking back, many ideas which are the
consensus of their day are patently false to us today. Only 500 years ago, Columbus’ contemporaries mostly believed
in a flat earth. Only 250 years ago, George Washington’s doctors bled him with leeches in accord with accepted
medical practice. If the proposed legislation operated in at those times, any scientist who said the world was round or
doctor who opposed bleeding for healing would be banned from social media for those views. This bill would stifle
scientific and medical progress and damage those living it its time. This bill should be rejected.

DEMOCRATIC
The framework of this bill in practice would mean that unelected bureaucracts at ACMA are able to prevent Australian
citizens from expressing their views online. This is not representative democracy. It is not government by the people
for the people. This bill should be rejected.

IDEOLOGICAL

There a a number of issues in contemporary Australia which are still far from resolved in public debate. For example,
many issues around sexuality. Clearly, many of the views from all directions which could be expressed on these
topics are capable of causing harm. Therefore, allowing a bill like this would essentially require the public to conform
to one ideological narrative in its online expression. This would destroy freedom of expression. This bill should be
rejected.

INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS

Article 19 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states that: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions WITHOUT INTERFERENCE... (emphasis added) This bill
would destroy that freedom. This bill should be rejected.

PUBLIC DEBATE
It is an essential part of a healthy society to have public debate, including where people deeply disagree. This bill
would stifle or destroy that debate and thereby undermine democracy and free speech. This bill should be rejected.

DOUBLE-STANDARD
It is noteworthy that government and professional news outlets are exempted from restriction under this proposal.
Content can be harmful no matter who publishes it. Governments and news outlets have a greater audience and
influence for their messaging. If anything, government and media outlets should be held to a higher, not a lower,
standard of preventing harm. This bill should be rejected.

AUTHORITARIANSIM
Australians rightly criticise modern authoritarian regimes for restricting freedom of expression by their citizens. We
should not follow the way of the oppressors. This bill should be rejected.

RECORD KEEPING
The framework proposes to require digital platform providers to keep and maintain records on users who post certain
types of content. Such a list could easily be adapted to be used as a kind of dissident black list, depending on the type
of harm being provided. This is an unwarranted invasion of privacy. This bill should be rejected.

EXECUTION
If some form of the bill would be enacted, the following is suggested;

All private messages to be exempted.

Freedom of expression should always override the harm principle — freedom of expression is the basic human right.
Ensure public oversight of a code of practice and any issues which are being reviewed.

I reject his bill and ask that parliament likewise reject this bill and anything similar.
