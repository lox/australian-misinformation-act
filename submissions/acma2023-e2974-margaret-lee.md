I completely oppose the proposed Disinformation bill, its intent being totally opposite to what a democratic society
like Australia should be.
We should be a free thinking, open minded and creative society   - which we have been.
Australia has prospered by encouraging new ideas and debate. This bill will ensure Australia becomes a totalitarian
state and the will of its people becomes submerged by government decree.
Our forefathers fought hard for our democracy & we should not give it up if the nation is to continue to prosper.
Those advocating this Bill are actually committing treason.
