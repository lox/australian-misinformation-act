**Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**

**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

_To the Department of Infrastructure,_
_Transport, Regional Development Communications and the Arts:_

_l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation_
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023._

_The proposed bill undermines freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that_
_fundamental right with the notion of combating so-called ‘misinformation’._
_Fundamental rights cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are_
_undermined._

_Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ is subjective and entrusting_
_a government agency to decide truthfulness raises grave concerns. We do not know_
_the details of what guidelines will be used to determine what constitutes_
_disinformation of misinformation and who will be the arbitrator of what this means. It_
_is possible if not even likely, personal opinions will creep into determining the_


_definitions thereof._


_So-called ‘misinformation’, unless it incites violence, does not cause direct harm, and_
_defining harm based on subjective criteria is problematic._

_Open and honest discussion is the best medium for regulating truth as well as so_
_called dis- and misinformation. This will be impossible with restrictions in what we_
_are allowed to talk about. It can even have a detrimental effect on science as_
_discussions is essential to the furthering of evolution._


_The bill grants excessive control to authorities and will lead to censorship._


_Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of_
_speech._
