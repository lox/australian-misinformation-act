To Whom it May Concern
I am concerned that Proposed Bill is a threat to Democracy & Freedom of Speech & I hope that all the
Repercussions of getting this wrong are considered I think that any well intended purposes of this Bill ie protection
from criminal use of misinformation Should already be covered by the rule of law It is important not to legislate to
control mass debate & difference of opinion Too much control is open to abuse & very dangerous Hopefully
Freedom of Speech & Democracy will not be lost to Overreaching Legislation
Yours Faithfully Rod Wonnacott
