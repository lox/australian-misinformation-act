_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)_

To Whom it May Concern

# It is my inalienable duty to recognize, observe, and uphold, all valid laws of the rightful habitants of these sacred, unceded, Peramangk Lands, of whose Elders i am a privileged guest. As a citizen of england i am obliged to recognize, furthermore, that any contravention of Lettræ Patentes, that were signed into law by King William lV on February 19, 1836, could be construed as High Treason, and that the only penalty prescribed for any contravention of those letters is death by hanging.

 Criminal organization 

 This cōlonial corporation of austral asia, often described in the media, which it controls, as ‘the government of australia’, differs from the normal, responsible, governing bodies of luckier islands overseas in many ways :

  It is a foreign-controled organization,

  Its usurpation of the sovereignty of Anangu islanders, the disseizin of their lands, the confiscation of their harvests that results from the corporation’s perpresture and plunder of their unceded, sacred, islands, all of which is in contravention of both the law of nations, and english laws, and the kind of War Crime that is described in the Statute of Rome as ‘The Most Serious Crime’,

  In the course of its unprovoked war against all of the habitants of these sacred, unceded islands, which has continued, unabated, for two hundred and thirty five years, the corporation is destroying three million square miles of sacred land, including several World Heritage Sites, by contaminating its soil, air, and water, has exterminated more than sixty percent of its endemic mammals, and more than ninety percent of its human habitants,

  The corporation’s nuclear bombardments of Monte Belo Islands and Emu Fields has rendered much of the land uninhabitable, yet the corporation

 ◦ continues to prevent the publication of CSIRO’s incriminating radiation studies

 ◦ fails to provide adequate health facilities for Anangu who were bombarded directly, are living on their heavily contaminated land, and are suffering severely from cancers and hereditary cancers as a result of the unprovoked, nuclear, war that, because the land is still contaminated is being waged against them,

  Its heavily armed militia, which has abrogated to itself monopoly of arms, is conducting a reign of terror are terrorizing, enslaving, and murdering, Anangu who were accorded english citizenship and protection by King George V. 


-----

#  The cōlonial usurpers are occupying, and waging unprovoked wars, against all of the unceded countries of these islands and committing many War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in the process, which they are trying to hide.  By means of their monopoly of arms, extra-judicial execution of Anangu, and systemic violence and ethnōcide, they are in the process of terrorizing into submission all who might oppose them or expose their crimes. 

 i ask you now :

  - why none of this information appears in any of the islands’ mainstream media
# or educational publications ? and

  why this bill seeks to exempt those sources from the provisions of this draft Bill ?

 In view of the number of crimes, including extrajudicial executions, war crimes, nuclear bombardments, disseizin, perpresture, acts of ethnōcide, systemic failure to recognize even the most basic human rights, and what the Statute of Rome lists as ‘The Most Serious Crime’, it must be averred that the cōlonial corporation that has usurped sovereignty by force of arms, and monopoly of arms, is a criminal organization that must be brought to justice and removed from power. 

 Since this cōlonial corporation publishes more propaganda, ‘disinformation’, and ‘misinformation’, than any other organization, it should NOT be exempted from ‘misinformation’ laws which could serve to protect it from its subjects’ scrutiny.

 The cōlonial corporation’s incessant propaganda campaign is demonizing even China, its largest, and most peaceful, trading partner by presenting it as an ‘aggressor’ — while allowing the United States of America, a rogue state and the world’s biggest aggressor, to swamp these sacred, unceded, islands with bases and missiles. Although all of these bases are primary nuclear targets in any war that that the US succeeds in igniting, the corporation refuses to publish a list of those that are being operated in alliance with the USA.

 The greatest concern is that all of the bases are situated on, or near to, Anangu homeland communities and that Anangu will be the first casualty of any war. The ICBM on Yolŋu Land is one example, but there are at least twelve other similar nuclear targets. 

 In its efforts to ignite wars with both China and Russia, the corporation has unleashed an incessant horde of misinformation and disinformation for the news channels, which it controls, to publish. 

 CENSORSHIP BILL


-----

# The current draft censorship bill is far more dangerous than any perceived problem it seeks to address because the terms “misinformation”, “disinformation”, and “harmful”, are not clearly defined and are open to broad misinterpretation.

 When governments contrive pretexts to limit speech, they are lurching down the dangerous path to totalitarianism. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia in 1948 helped to draft, states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

 In the course of its unlawful occupation and unprovoked war, and nuclear war, against the islands of austral asia, this corporation has waged war, as well, against peaceful populations in Turkey, Palestine, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. It is now threatening to wage war against China, a peaceful neighbor, and vying to become a nuclear power. They are now seeking to become the 51st state of yet another Rogue State, the ‘USA’, which is usurping sovereignty of much of what was once a peaceful, and happy, planet.

 A corporation, which is committing serious crimes and going to great lengths to hide those crimes, is now trying to pass a bill that is designed to punish severely all decent humans who are intent on monitoring, investigating, exposing, and preventing crime; while protecting itself from scrutiny.

 Its actions in pursuing whistle-blowers Collaery (Timor), MacBride (Afghanistan), and its failure to protect journalists who expose its war crimes, the likes of the Balibo Five (Timor), and Julian Assange, is evidence that the corporation is intent on hiding its crimes and cannot be trusted as a source of any information on any topic. No criminal organization should be allowed to hold a monopoly of either arms or information.

 On april 29, 1770, Elders asked a junior naval officer, a thief, to leave, which was a lawful request. In accordance with his king’s explicit instructions, lieutenant Cook’s ships should have sailed away immediately but, instead, Cook’s response was to shoot the Elders. That coup d’etat was the opening salvo of the world’s biggest, unprovoked, war and more than 253 years’ of enslavement, holocaust, and plunder, that the corporation’s usurpers continue to wage, unabated, today.

 These crimes can be exposed only by unhindered access to public communication channels; which is why this Bill seeks to hinder free speech, particularly any speech critical of the corporation.

 Intellectual and personal freedom in public debate and public policy, including the application of classic scientific methods to the analysis of scientific questions, and the

 Another example of why this Bill should be quashed:

 Social media exposes the corporation’s crimes

 Guardian newspaper, 2023 August 18
 Exclusive | NSW police have launched an investigation after a young Aboriginal man with a disability was violently arrested while having a seizure and thrown to the ground while handcuffed in Taree. An investigation is underway after footage circulating on social media showed the violent arrest of an Aboriginal man with a disability in New South Wales. A video shows the 18-year-old being walked along a driveway by an officer in Taree before stumbling and falling to the ground, where he begins having a seizure. A second clip shows the teenager – handcuffed – being violently thrown to the ground by the officer.

 Excess deaths

The corporation’s official mortality statistics make it abundantly clear that there were 40,908
unexpected, excess, deaths in the 12 months of 2022. 40,908 deaths in that one year is equivalent to
4.5 large passenger jets crashing every week, and is sensational news. However, due to the
corporation’s brutal censorship of all main-stream media, this statistic is generally known only to
those residents who had access to, and could share, information freely on the internet.

It was only by sourcing statistics such as these, by interpreting them, and publishing their findings
and studies on line, that renowned statisticians, epidemiölogists, virölogists, and immunölogists,
were able to save many lives. Their findings made it evident that :

  - The corporation’s ‘covid’ scare campaign, and the mandatory injections that were supposed
to prevent infection and transmission of ‘the pandemic’, were directly responsible for the
sudden increase in excess deaths,

  - Excess deaths resulting from the injections were far in excess of the mortality rate of those
who are jab ‘hesitant’ whose survival was due, in large part, to their ability to access
information from reliable sources on the internet, and share it with others on social media.

  - Those who were injected are far more likely to contract pulmonary infection, cancer, and
other illnesses, and to die on account of them.

The only possible purpose of this bill is to thwart an investigation into the rôle of government
during the ‘pandemic’.

# Censorship

Had the people on these unceded islands been prevented from accessing reliable information from
their private on line sources, and sharing it with others, and been allowed no alternative information
other than the lies and censored propaganda that your corrupt corporation is forcing the media to
publish, few would know that :

  - The corporation’s department of child ‘protection’ is engaged in child theft and trafficking,


-----

  - Extrajudicial executions by the corporation’s police and prison wardens is a common
occurrence, and very few of them are called to account, and fewer yet are punished.

  - The family tree of ‘south australia’’s attorney general and ‘minister of aboriginal affairs’,
who was appointed on the basis of his ancestral right of abode on these sacred, unceded,
Lands, lists only german and scottish ancestry.

  - The corporation has signed the UN’s refugee convention to the effect that seeking asylum is
legal and that its transportation, imprisonment, torture, of innocent asylum seekers is
unlawful.

The ABC Ombudsman has just released a six-month report for 2023 disclosing 1,500 complaints on
ABC content, of which 535 were investigated. 120 (23 percent) of these were found to have need of
correction or were found to be in breach of editorial standards. It can be viewed here :
https://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OO-6-month-report-Jan-to-June-2023.pdf
In accordance with the terms of this bill, your subjects are likely to be charged, and punished
severely, for questioning, or discussing, excluded content that is published, or broadcast, by the
media which is any way false, misleading, or deceptive.

# Martial law

The corporation’s collusion with, and censorship of, media companies to promote its orthodoxy and
to prevent its critics from spreading dissent is clearly in violation of its own anti-trust laws. It also
renders ‘free’ and ’fair’ elections impossible. Any attempt to manipulate public opinion by
censoring even one communication channel can be construed, by a bona fide court that observes,
recognizes, and upholds valid laws, as an act of violence, a Befehlnotstand, and an extreme act of
tyranny. Since martial law, of this kind, can manipulate elections it will demolish the last vestiges
of the corporation’s farcical pretense of ‘democracy’.
# Definitions of terms

Since the 'definitions' provided of 'misinformation' and 'disinformation', and many other of the terms that are
contained in this bill, are open to a colossal degree of interpretation, such a law, were it to be passed, is likely
to subject every litigant to very great personal expenditure and much wasted time in court. From the
corporation’s extensive history of loosely defined legal terms I am forced to conclude that this practice is not
in any way accidental, but deliberate.
