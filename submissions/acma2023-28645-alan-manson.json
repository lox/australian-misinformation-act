      "The only effective way to combat misinformation is through public refutation, not censorship.",

      "For me, introducing any restrictions that affect: political debate; the public health response to COVID-19; the supposed foreign interference in elections, and 'undermining' democracy—is abhorrent and totally un-Australian.",

      "I recognise that social media is rife with misinformation and disinformation; but the only way to combat it is to publicly refute it, not censor it."
