Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

There are a number of things, contained in this Bill which by definition make it very dangerous for freedom of speech
in Australia; especially being that freedom of speech is our most valued intangible asset.

It is just not good enough that there are no protections in Law to prevent unelected public servants from making
subjective judgements guided by their own natural bias. Using a dictionary definition of harm is also so broadly open
to subjective interpretation that inevitably injustice must prevail as often as not.

An unnatural hothouse environment of fear would prevail, in which citizens will not feel they are able to speak out in
matters of conscience or even social issues for fear of being victimized. This proposed “Misinformation /
disinformation amendment Bill” is a disgrace to the Australian Parliament and all those involved in putting it together.
Free speech is a non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

It is literally quite impossible for governments to police the outcomes of subjective thinking gone wrong; either
intended or not they will potentially lead to criminal convictions.

Australians have felt many unjust impositions on their freedoms about what they can and cannot say over the last
three years. This proposed bill is just an extreme and very unprofessional upgrade. I do not believe Australians will
tolerate it Neither should they be demonised for choosing to speak freely Heads will certainly roll at the next election if
it passes
