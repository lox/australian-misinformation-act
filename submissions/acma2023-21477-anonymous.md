## Submission in reference to the

# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

This Bill has the potential to be used in a way that censors everyday Australians from having their say
freely, we cannot have an open discussion if voices are censored, we may not agree with what other
people say but we should allow open discussion for full transparency!

This Bill puts us on a one-way road to dictatorship. Never should Australia have such a one-sided piece
of Legislation aimed at censoring voices other than what the official narrative puts out. The people in
Australia can discern and analyse social media, even if they don’t agree with the status quo. This
Legislation has the potential to be a very draconian piece of Legislation that has no place in a free and
civil society, and is remiscent of the “Ministry of Truth” from dictatorships past. It asks the question who
will oversee this and what could go wrong with such a broad scope that could be interpreted and made
very authoritarian to the point of censoring voices other than the status quo which would be an assault
on free and open discussion which is very much needed for transparency and accountability. I oppose
this legislation and do not want Australians to be subjected to it. We do not want propaganda to thrive,
we need all voices not just one voice. Who has the right to dictate to the Australian Communities what
they can and cannot say? There are so many scenarios where this Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Misinformation) Bill 2023 No., 2023 could go wrong, e.g. What happens if
the overseer has ulterior motivations themselves e.g., they have psychopathic motives, where is the
safety mechanisms to ensure that these things don’t happen. There really is no need for such a Bill. I do
not want this Legislation also because we do not want to get into a position that has people wondering
what subject could be censored next? We must allow conversations to be free from censorship to
facilitate fully transparent discussion both online and offline. These discussions are the lifeblood of
democracy and diplomacy nurturing, understanding, progress and unity let us keep the flame alive by
opposing this Legislation.
