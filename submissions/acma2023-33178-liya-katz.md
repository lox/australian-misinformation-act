**Submission of Liya Katz - Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on**

**and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023**

I am extremely concerned about the ramifica�ons of the proposed Communica�on Legisla�on
Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023 (“the Bill”) being passed.
Whilst I acknowledge that there is an abundance of false and misleading informa�on on digital
pla�orms, I believe that the proposed law will do more harm than good.

It is impossible to design a legisla�ve framework that would correctly target misleading informa�on,
a�ain a balance with freedom of speech and avoid conflicts of interest. The Bill is certainly very far off
the mark. ACMA already has voluntary codes in place and social media pla�orms also have their own
processes, with a commercial interest in being seen as reliable by the majority of people. The solu�ons
to the problem are constantly evolving, so this is not an area where the problem has stagnated or
reached some point where urgent government interven�on is necessary.

**What cons�tutes misinforma�on**
The glaring issue with the proposed law is the nebulous criteria for determining what cons�tutes
'misinforma�on'. A number of topics that were censored a couple of years ago are now discussed on
mainstream media.

The defini�on of ‘’misinforma�on’’ in the Bill is open for overly wide interpreta�on. At the very least,
differences should be drawn between outright falsehoods (for example if I refer to a study, but quote
it incorrectly), misleading informa�on (such as if I point to a part of a study to draw a conclusion and
leave out conflic�ng informa�on within the study) and ques�oning ma�ers that we are s�ll learning
about, whether they be conflic�ng accounts of an event, or scien�fic enquiry.

Ques�oning popular views or providing contrary opinions should be clearly out of the scope of
‘misinforma�on’ and ‘disinforma�on’. The wide scope for what cons�tutes misinforma�on under the
current Bill, coupled with the very severe penal�es proposed in the Bill are very likely to result in overly
zealous censorship by the digital pla�orms themselves.

**The arbiter of truth**
The fact that a government body will ul�mately make determina�ons about the efficacy of
misinforma�on comba�ng processes also creates a major conflict of interest that will leave us all
prone to poli�cal manipula�on. Claims that ACMA is independent cannot be taken seriously when the
government is responsible for funding and is likely to earmark funds for this func�on.

**Unintended consequences**
The proposed legisla�ve framework is very likely to breed further suspicion and undermine trust in
government and mainstream media content, rather than boost confidence in digital pla�orm content.
The aforemen�oned issues, coupled with the exemp�on for government from the proposed law, is
very likely to be seen as nothing more than mandated, self serving collusion between big tech and
government to determine what cons�tutes truth.

The vast majority of people use the digital pla�orms that already voluntarily liaise with ACMA to
develop their misinforma�on management processes. If the Bill is passed, however, it is likely to make
people who already search for alterna�ve viewpoints more suspicious of all digital pla�orms. It will
reinforce the idea that there is something to hide. Private chats with like-minded people will be

created. Without general public par�cipa�on, these will become unchecked echo chambers,
exacerba�ng any misinforma�on problem. There is no way to combat this, as it should be self evident
that monitoring private chat groups (no ma�er how large) would cons�tute gross government
overreach.

**Freedom of speech**
It is absolutely necessary for the func�oning of our democra�c system to ensure that freedom of
speech is not impacted in any way. If a legisla�ve framework infringes on this fundamental facet of
society, this will greatly undermine public trust in not only the government, but our democra�c process
itself.

The best way to combat misinforma�on is to provide full transparent informa�on. For example, if there
is a par�cular issue that is of concern, then government should provide full disclosure regarding its
decision making, relevant studies and reports, budgets etc. Rigorous, transparent debate not only
brings us closer to the truth, but it also ins�ls confidence and empowers the people.
