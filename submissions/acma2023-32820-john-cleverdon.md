Hello,

There is a clear danger in the "Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023" and this is that is turns an Orwellian dystopia such as the novel "1984"
into reality. And yes, I do have 5 of the classic dystopia novels, and I can see how prophetic they are
becoming.
This Bill would see the ‘Ministry of Truth’ from ‘1984’ become reality, where anything Anthony
Albanese didn’t like disappear via self-censorship, the modern equivalent to the ‘memory hole’.

A government currently in power that operates in a 'snowflake' mode (ie. does not like to get
criticism of it's policies or ideology) becomes able to silence all opposition in something one would
expect from Nazi Germany or the Communist Soviet Union (and indeed, that is where the ideology of
the ALP-Greens risks heading).
What such legislation means is that Australia will no longer become a democracy but instead end up
as an authoritarian regime.
Silencing all opposition (which is Albanese’s desire) is the *opposite* of how Western classic liberal
democracy came about.
As part of this, one only needs to think of the Magna Carta or Martin Luther’s 95 Theses
(remembering that Luther was lucky to not be executed as a result of his actions).

It is clear therefore that Albanese’s actions are anti-democratic, and this Bill is even more dangerous
given that Australia has no equivalent to the First Amendment in the United States Constitution
which protects free speech.

The only type of person who would want to introduce such legislation is someone who wants to
smash their jackboot down on anyone who disagrees with them.
