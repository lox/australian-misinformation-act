Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am a father and a grand father                - and a proud Australian.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian and has helped shape the nation we have today.

This proposed “misinformation” law is an attack on our basic human rights by a government that is supposed to
uphold those rights, not stifle them.

I make my own decisions and determinations based upon information sources that I trust and that present a breadth
of fact and opinions.

I do not need government to make up my mind                - and I am terrified by the thought that the government could interfere
with my process by limiting what information I can access.

The government is attempting to place upon itself an impossible burden of objectivity. No government body has the
wisdom or ability to sort out what is true and what isn’t.

We’ve never had so much information available at our fingertips in all of human history. The amount of information
that can be accessed online is incredibly vast. What group of bureaucrats could possibly discern truth from falsehood
on every subject?

The bill’s stated aim is to keep Australians from “harm”. Preventing harm is a good thing. The problem is that the
proposed law will ultimately do great harm itself.

One example is the recent pandemic and the question of where COVID-19 originated. The official line was that it
came from nature and that the lab origin was “misinformation” that could “harm” our relationship with China.

Now we have learned that the virus likely did come from the Wuhan lab. What was once called “misinformation” is
now quite possibly the truth! The question of COVID-19’s origin is vital so that we can avoid a repeat scenario.

Censoring truthful reporting about the lab leak theory will itself cause “harm” by preventing us from learning from our
mistakes.

With this one example, we can see how the proposed “misinformation” law will increase “harm” even as it seeks to
reduce it.

The bill is misguided and it is dangerous    - and must be rejected.
