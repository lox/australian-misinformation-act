Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
## Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and

the Arts

I am writing to express my deep concern and opposition at the draft bill titled the

"Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)

Bill 2023". As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill blatantly disregards our

## fundamental freedom of speech.

The proposed legislation creates a clear division among Australians, with politicians,

journalists, and members of educational institutions being granted the power to spread

## information, whether true or false, online. Meanwhile, the rest of us, the regular Australian

men and women, who often possess extensive knowledge on various topics, are subjected to

excessive fines and limitations on our ability to express viewpoints. This biased division

undermines the democratic principles on which our nation is built and disproportionately

harms ordinary individuals.

Furthermore, the bill's stringent code of conduct will considerably restrict freedom of speech

on digital platforms, surpassing even the most stringent existing regulations. This harm is

## amplified by the fact that the code applies to the entire industry without any avenues for

relief or alternative solutions.

The task of accurately determining what is true or false is virtually impossible. New
## information emerges constantly, often contradicting previously accepted facts. It is important to note that what was once considered an authoritative fact can later be proven false. For

instance, several statements about COVID-19, such as the effectiveness of masks, evidence of
## human-to-human transmission, and vaccine-related information, were initially stated as facts but were later found to be incorrect. These examples demonstrate that even trusted
 authorities and expert consensus can falter in their judgment of truth.

What's even more concerning is that the bill targets not only provably false information but

also true information deemed "misleading" or "deceptive." Freedom of speech allows for


-----

open and honest discussions, enabling people to be wrong and fostering debate in the

pursuit of truth and common ground. By censoring information seen as "misleading," this bill

suppresses healthy discourse and undermines the value of diverse viewpoints.

## Additionally, the proposed bill violates constitutional principles by delegating legislative
 power to private entities not directly accountable to Parliament. Such a delegation

undermines the democratic process and relinquishes the authority Parliament holds to make

laws. The power granted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in

enacting Misinformation Standards and Digital Platform Rules infringes upon the
## constitutionally implied freedom of political communication. Matters of public policy,
 including those related to public health, the environment, and the economy, are highly

contested among political parties and interest groups. Limiting discussions on these topics

unreasonably curtails the freedom of political communication.

The bill's assumption that the government and select accredited institutions can determine

absolute truth without considering the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians is

## deeply flawed. Diversity in viewpoints is crucial for the sense-making process, allowing for

the consideration of all possibilities. By deplatforming certain views as misinformation, this

bill suppresses diversity and stifles the contributions of regular citizens.

Furthermore, the bill introduces threats to both Digital Platform Providers and ordinary users.

Digital Platform Providers face negative impacts on their reputation, financial penalties, and

the inconvenience of complying with onerous requirements. Ordinary users may be subject
## to distress and personal burdens if they are summoned before the ACMA. Additionally,

forcing ordinary citizens to report on their friends, families, or political associates is

reminiscent of an oppressive regime, contrary to the Australian values of mateship and

freedom.

This legislation also poses a serious threat to independent media organizations, journalists,

and bloggers. The reporting standards and misinformation reports they will be subjected to

are complex and could tarnish their reputations. Meanwhile, government-approved
## journalists are exempt from these requirements, potentially incentivizing them to provide
favourable news coverage and perspectives aligned with the government's agenda. This

creates an unfair advantage for approved journalists and hinders independent media

organizations from challenging the status quo.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 severely undermines the principles of freedom of speech, stifles

democratic discourse, and disregards the diversity of viewpoints that underpin our society. I
## strongly urge the Department to reconsider the provisions of this bill and prioritize the protection and promotion of democratic values and open public discourse.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take my concerns seriously

and reflect upon the implications of this bill on our democratic society, and keep Australia as

a transparent democracy

Yours sincerely
