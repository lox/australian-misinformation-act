This submission is on the “exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023” as accessed at the following link:

https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/new-acma-powers-combat-misinformationand-disinformation

The preamble (under the heading ‘The Issue’ to the exposure draft contains the following
statement:

_“Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians,_
_as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”_

This is a very sensational and emotive statement that in my view dramatically overstates the
impact of so-called misinformation and disinformation on various facets of Australian life.
The statement would be strengthened with examples of where this has occurred in the past.
As long as humans have walked the earth there are those who seek to gain by distorting or
misrepresenting the truth or spreading lies - including governments. But the right to free
speech permits the free expression of views, opinions and ideas and this right should be
absolute even if the information has little basis in truth.

The truth in many disciplines is not as easy as 2+2=4. Truth evolves via the contest of
ideas, robust debate, and testing hypotheses.

Throughout history there have been many examples of individuals who were ignored, vilified,
and marginalised for spreading so-called misinformation/disinformation that turned out not
only to be true, but are now accepted as dogma. Some well-known examples are:

- Ignaz Semmelweis’ claims that if doctors washed their hands prior to delivering babies
many lives would be saved

- Galileo Galilei – “The Earth is not the centre of the Solar System” – the sun is”

- Louis Pasteur – “Infections are spread by invisible germs”

Fast forward to the present and in the era of the digital age there are many more examples
of individuals whose views have wrongly been censored and pilloried. This is especially the
case regarding information about COVID-19, treatments, and vaccines. Many wellcredentialled scientists have been censored for their views and been de-platformed from
sites such as Facebook and Twitter. ‘Fact-checking’ has become pervasive and laughably,
the ‘fact-checkers’ are attacking eminent scientists for their views even as the ‘fact-checks’ –
certainly in the case of Facebook, have been revealed to be no more than opinions.

The so-called ‘twitter files’ has laid bare the extent to which the US Government was
colluding with Twitter employees to have certain views and/or accounts removed, many of
which turned out to be true.

There is currently a lawsuit underway in the United States ‘Missouri vs Biden’ brought
forward by the Attorneys’ General of Missouri, Lousianna and private citizens over alleged
breaches of the First Amendment right to free speech. The judge issued a ruling on 4 July –
a 155 page document that included the following:

_The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the Government has used its_
_power to silence the opposition. Opposition to COVID-19 vaccines; opposition to COVID-19_


-----

_masking and lockdowns; opposition to the lab-leak theory of COVID-19; opposition to the validity_
_of the 2020 election; opposition to President Biden’s policies; statements that the Hunter Biden_
_laptop story was true; and opposition to policies of the government officials in power. All were_
_suppressed. It is quite telling that each example or category of suppressed speech was_
_conservative in nature. This targeted suppression of conservative ideas is a perfect example of_
_viewpoint discrimination of political speech. American citizens have the right to engage in free_
_debate about the significant issues affecting the country. If the allegations made by plaintiffs are_
_true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United_
_States' history. The plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the_
_government has used its power to silence the opposition."[[]_

In Australia, information received under FOI and confirmed in Senate Estimates questioning
by Senator Alex Antic - the Department of Home Affairs has been contacting social media
companies to highlight ‘posts’ by individuals that it considers misinformation, that have later
turned out to be true.

This highlights the dangers of having a single entity as the arbiter of truth.

Some examples of true information that led to censorship/social media account suspension
were:

  - The mRNA vaccines for Covid do NOT stay at the injection site as was claimed

  - The Covid vaccines DO NOT stop infection and transmission as was claimed

  - SARS-COV-2 is now widely accepted to have come from a lab and NOT from the
Wuhan wet market/zoonotic spillover

  - Vaccinated individuals can get sick and die from Covid

  - The New York Post’s Twitter and Facebook accounts were suspended due to its
reporting of the Hunter Biden files/laptop – a story that turned out to be true.

The proposed legislation will enable bureaucrats within ACMA to determine what is
misinformation and disinformation, as if it can be the arbiter of truth. The reality is that these
proposed laws are an affront to the notion of free speech. Orwell’s 1984 was not supposed
to be a guide to government policy – but these proposed laws bring a ‘Ministry of Truth’ one
step closer to creation.

The preamble to the exposure draft also contains the following statement:

_“The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital platforms to do_
_more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation and_
_disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech.”_

There is no ‘balancing freedom of speech’ with these proposed laws – they are intended to
limit free speech. Australia already has a raft of laws that provide individuals with protection
on-line, such as privacy laws and anti-discrimination laws, as well as laws relating to
counter-terrorism. But these proposed laws essentially allow for views and opinions to be
censored at the whim of bureaucrats, who may be under the influence of government. And it
would be impossible for employees of ACMA to be expert enough on any given topic to
arbitrate as to what information is true or not.

The better way to get to the truth is via the free expression of ideas. In the end, ideas or
views that aren’t backed by evidence, or a rational argument, will ultimately fade into the
abyss. It is therefore the community itself that will inevitably ensure that the truth prevails.


-----

In summary, these proposed laws are unnecessary, dangerous and constitute a dramatic
over-reach of government. There are ample laws currently in place that provide protection
from harm without going down this path. Establishing a government agency as the arbiter of
truth is a dangerous proposition and will not have the intended effect. Indeed it may result in
a slowdown in the evolution of truth as dissenters are silenced.

My respectful suggestion therefore is to condemn this exposure draft to the virtual shredder.
