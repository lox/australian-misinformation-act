Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I rely on social media for information and it is a good way to communicate with my family, friends and co-workers.
What I consider good and right might be seen as wrong in terms of the Government's position. If the Government
determines what is "misinformation" and punishes people who do not line up with what they think is acceptable or not,
this is Government overreach. Giving the government such unrestricted power is not acceptable. In fact this proposed
'Misinformation Bill’ is dangerous.

Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because
it’s easy to see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Innocent people could be punished unfairly. Meta
said that the law would have a “chilling” effect on free speech. It would be easy for a government to label as
“misinformation” anything that could affect its reputation (as many authoritarian governments already do).

We live in a democracy and we need the freedom to be able to debate with the free flow of ideas and information and
to consider what different people think to arrive at a certain position. Censoring certain information or opinions hinders
this vital process.

It’s easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found to be
against their thinking. The proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed. There is much
opposition to this proposed law among journalists, religious groups, conservatives and users of social media like me.

Please reject this proposed law.

Thank you for reading my submission.
