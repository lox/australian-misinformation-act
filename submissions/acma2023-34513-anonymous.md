     Hello ACMA,
     Your new proposed censorship law has a big flaw I want to point out in order for
      you to plug it in time before anything is enacted.
     I offer this as part of my service to the public:
     Your current draft legislation does not specifically define what constitutes
     dis-information or mis-information, so let me help you out with some proposed
     additional language in order to avoid relentless legal battles aimed against
     ACMA or notices put against any man or woman in 'the authority' and executives
     of ACMA when your ill-educated, ill-informed and ill-qualified staff deem
     something that is a statement made by highly educated and qualified
      professionals citing peer-reviewed science - even research published by the WHO,
     CDC, FDA, TGA, etc. - as now being classified as disinformation or
     misinformation by corporate government agencies under ACMA's new dictatorial
     control over public media.
     "Further, disinformation and misinformation - needing to be now censored and
     silenced at the sole discretion of ACMA - is specifically defined as any facts,
     opinion or re-presentations of either 'corporate government body' published or
     'peer-reviewed' published data or statistics or other scientifcally credible and
     established research that are now not in alignment or lockstep with the current
     'offical' narrative being paid for, promoted and demanded by the
     Rothschild/Cabal's et. al. captured global corporate public media assets, Bill
     Gate's WHO, or blackrock/vanguard's big-pharma/CDC/NIH/FDA or other private
     corporate or public corporate government agency propaganda, at the sole
     discretion of ACMA, a wholly captured agency with no lawful standing, in the
     interest of maximizing (blackrock/vanguard et. al.) quarterly shareholder
     earnings of said captured and owned corporate assets above.
     Corporate government entities or agents including but not limited to the above
     are furthermore hereinafter exempted from conversely promoting what can be
     demonstrated - even proven to be - disinformation, misinformaion, known false
     science or outright lies and fraud."
