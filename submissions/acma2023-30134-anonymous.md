# ACMA Misinformation and Disinformation Submission
9/8/23

I vehemently oppose any form of censorship. Everyone is entitled to freedom of
speech in a true democracy, whose foundation is individual agency and intellectual
autonomy. Engagement, discussion, debate, discernment, independent thought and
diverse opinions are the lifeblood of a democracy and nurture mutual understanding
and unity.

Assuming the role of protector and condescending to arbitrate on what is truth and
what is not truth, is gross government overreach. It begs the question of whose
interests such “truth” will serve – the financial concerns of the multi-national
corporations with which our government is entwined create such an obvious conflict
of interest. I believe it is vital that transparency, accountability, and the true spirit of
democracy are upheld.
