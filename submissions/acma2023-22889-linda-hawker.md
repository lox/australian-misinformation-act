Submission

I am strongly opposed to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. The increased powers this bill would
grant the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is very scary for
all Australian people and organisations whose views on social issues are not in line
with the government narrative. As it will be a government body or government
influenced body who decides what is characterised as ‘misinformation’ and/or
‘disinformation’. This is exactly what happens in China and North Korea, both
communist nations.

I as an Australian have enjoyed the freedoms offered in our Constitution, such as
freedom of speech and religion. I have appreciated the tension that comes from a
multi-cultural society that has grown with debate as we manage life and the
confliction of the way we do life together. Unity does not mean that we are all the
same, but rather with very different views and expressions of humanity we head in
the same direction. This is what made Australia shine in the world. But that view is
not held any longer.

From 2020-2022 with Australia’s draconian response to covid and its connection to
WEF, and WHO and the driven globalist agenda we saw all messaging contrary to
these bodies’ opinions from masking, isolation, vaccinations, and origins removed,
censored, or branded as conspiracy. Yet in 2023 we see that in fact the government
narrative backed by WHO and WEF was the disinformation. This has left little trust in
these entities. People have been forced to shift to social media outlets for the truth
as all major outlets are censored and pushing disinformation.

As a Christian, to stand on traditional Biblical values and a Christian world view that
this Nation was built upon brings accusations of ‘misinformation’. To value family,
life, marriage, purity, safety, women, kindness, hope, transformation, and
redemption make me liable to the same unfair accusations. If we go back many
years, we will see a greater Australia holding to these truths. Abnormal was not
normalised and how you feel was not who you were. People loved life, the unborn,
the elderly, were eager to work and have families and valued one another. There
was a united front to create an amazing society that was very diverse and had many
problems to overcome but were making great progress. I see the current
governments undermining Australian society limiting Australians, destroying
freedoms, causing costs to soar due to unproven agendas and ideologies to make

people dependant on the government. (The globalist’s dream) Who is to say this
isn’t disinformation. It is certainly based on opinion and not evidence hence is not
factual truth.

Due to these reasons, I reject the proposed bill.

Who decides on what determines ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’, ‘fake news’ and
‘hate speech’. We have seen these terms used extensively by critics, regulators,
bureaucrats, and political actors to smear ideas they don’t like and to restrict
people’s freedom to express those ideas. Many of which have been proven to be
lies themselves that dissolves people’s trust in any body that is governed and
manipulated by government or media.

A concept like ‘misinformation’ is unavoidably subjective. What one person regards
as ‘misinformation’, another may deem to be a perfectly moral viewpoint, a fact of
nature, or a self-evident proposition. On countless subjects, even the line between
what is fact and what is opinion is hotly debated. Time itself usually is the factor that
proves if these terms are fact or fiction. Who gets to decide what is true versus what
is ‘misinformation’? The political party that forms government? Most citizens? CEOs
of media conglomerates? Intergovernmental bodies like the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the World Health Organisation or the World Economic
Forum? None of these entities have a track record of honesty but are full of
corruption and driven by money and an agenda contrary to what most Australians
would want (If they knew about it). Hence, I guess that is why you want this bill, to
stop everyday Australians from being able to decide for themselves what is best for
our Nation if given all the information.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian. Australia is a
founding member of the United Nations and an original signatory of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Article 18 and 19 of that declaration reads:

_(18) Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; this_
_right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or_
_in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in_
_teaching, practice, worship, and observance._
(19) Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart_
_information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers._

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 would put the Commonwealth of Australia in breach of its
international human rights obligations and at odds with its own nation’s character
and values. This Bill is totalitarian and pushing Australia into tyranny.

Another dangerous aspect of the bill’s exposure draft is that “content that is
authorised by the Commonwealth or a State” along with “professional news
content” would be granted immunity from the proposed ACMA powers. This allows
only government operatives and State-sanctioned news outlets to guide the public
discourse. We fought wars to keep freedom and liberty, where young men willingly
signed up to give their lives to stop communism, and marxism. Australians fear
communist China and yet here we are with our own government trying to
implement the restrictions China puts on its own citizens. I have never voted for
socialist, Marxist, or communist leaders in Australia, nor will I. The length of time
past has caused people to forget the tragedies, deaths, and destruction such
ideologies place on nations. I never thought we would have such a situation in
Australia.

I therefore oppose this Bill in all forms and call you to honour Australia’s citizens
with the freedoms we have been bestowed Nationally and Internationally and be
allowed to continue to hold our government to account. Government serves the
people, not people serving government.
