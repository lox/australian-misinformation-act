Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write this submission with utmost outrage and concern regarding the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As a concerned citizen, I strongly believe
that the government's attempt to address misinformation is unnecessary and represents a worrisome infringement
on the freedom of speech and democracy in our country.

Firstly, the delegation of legislative power to private entities, as outlined in the Bill, is a direct affront to the
principles of democracy and accountability. The High Court has consistently argued that such power should be
rightfully vested in ministers who are responsible to Parliament. By granting private entities the authority to create
Misinformation Codes that hold the weight of law, the proposed Bill disregards this essential principle and
constitutes an unconstitutional abdication of parliamentary power.

Moreover, the provisions granting the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) the ability to
establish Misinformation Standards and Digital Platform Rules directly contradict the implied constitutional freedom
of political communication. It is vital to note that these provisions neither add nor enhance the existing
constitutional prohibition on the infringement of this fundamental freedom. Instead, they further restrict legitimate
discussions and debates on matters of public policy, such as health, environment, and economy, which are highly
contested among various political parties and interest groups. These limitations unreasonably curtail the essential


-----

issue, as it fails to provide clear guidelines and accountability mechanisms. By inviting private entities to determine
what constitutes misinformation and serious harm, the proposed Bill endangers the democratic principles of
transparency, accountability, and open discourse.

Furthermore, it must be recognized that combating misinformation should not be the sole responsibility of the
government or private entities. Instead, the focus should be on enhancing media literacy and critical thinking skills to
empower citizens to discern fact from fiction independently. Initiatives promoting media literacy, public awareness
campaigns, and fact-checking resources should be prioritized to foster an informed and educated society.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. The proposed Bill not only undermines the principles of democracy and freedom of speech
but also risks stifling public debate on critical matters of public policy. I urge the Department of Infrastructure,
Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider this Bill and instead focus on
empowering citizens through education and critical thinking.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will respect the voices of concerned citizens and act in the
best interest of our democratic society.

Yours sincerely,

Vesela Atanasovska
