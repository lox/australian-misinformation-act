Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am writing to share my concerns about and objections to the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

This bill represents severe overreach on the part of our government. It's not their job to decide what is true or appoint
anyone else to do so. Further it is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think.
It is all too easy to see how unelected bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers
are granted to them.
The government is accountable to the people who elected them not the other way around.
The double standard where the public are held accountable and the government and media are exempt is hypocritical
and intolerable. This will only increase public distrust of the government.

It is a breach of international agreements we have signed, for example

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a
violation of Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

The vagaries in this bill also leave far to much of its powers open to misuse and abuse with no mechanisms in place
for oversight and accountability on the use of its powers by media platforms.

International law recognises freedom of expression as a fundamental right and this bill is inconsistent with that also.

Please reject this bill.
