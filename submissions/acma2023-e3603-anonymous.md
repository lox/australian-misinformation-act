Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

The “Misinformation Bill” must be rejected.

I am a concerned grandfather wanting to protect the freedoms I had so that my grandchildren can flourish too.

Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a free and fair society. It is a fundamental value of Australia. Despite denials to
the contrary, the proposed bill will erode this fundamental human right.

Freedom of speech is essential in attempting to discover truth. The whole process of discovery relies on free-flowing
information that can be tested and questioned. There are many instances when society or the government of the day
has held to a position or scientific idea, only to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this
essential dialogue.

The internet has become the ‘town square’ where the latest ideas can be debated. Now people can send factual
information around the world in an instant, as well as spread false ideas. There are positives and negatives to modern
technology. But setting up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer.

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out. Please stop this Orwellian idea!
