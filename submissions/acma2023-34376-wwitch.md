Women’s Wisdom in the Church, a Women’s group focusing on the need for women’s
experiences, expertise and skills to be recognised in the Catholic Church wishes to support
the submission made to The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinofmration and Disinformation) Bill 2023 by Catholics for Renewal.

We totally support Catholics for Renewal’s statements that

(a) will fall foul of the proposed legislation, and
(b) that no exemption should be granted to teach it on the relevant media platforms,
and

(c) that, if it is to be taught on those platforms, the bill ought to be amended to require
the church (and other religious bodies teaching it on such platforms) to accompany
the teaching with an acknowledgment that modern psychiatry has ceased to regard
homosexuality as a disorder, and instead regards it as falling on the spectrum of
norm sexuality."

We wish to emphasise the changes in modern psychiatry that no longer classify
homosexuality as a clinical disorder requiring treatment.
