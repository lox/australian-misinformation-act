The terms ‘Misinformation’ and ‘Disinformation’ are relative terms, referring to what someone
believes to be the ‘truth’.

Who is to decide that? Human’s quest for truth is an ongoing process, and very often what is
perceived to be the ‘truth’ will turn out to be false (aka ‘not a truth’) as more information is
uncovered.

Remember Galileo Galilei who said the Earth revolves around the sun, instead of the Church
orthodoxy (i.e. “government”) during his time that says the Earth was the centre of the universe?
Galileo turned out to be right !

Want a more recent example? Just take Covid.

Remember just 2 years ago, the government said, ‘lockdown will flatten the curve’, ‘Covid vaccines
will stop the spread’?

Both turned out to be false!!

So if the government often get things wrong – as any Opposition Party says so often – why should the
government be the arbitrator of what is true, by deciding what is Misinformation or Disinformation?
Which is what this Bill essentially allows through the agency ACMA.

**CHAOS is all we get if the Parliament passes this Bill. So please don’t.**

The decision of what is true and what is not true (disinformation/misinformation), should sit with
everyone who consumes the information, not the government.

If the government thinks we the people – the adults especially – can’t even decide what is true or
not and need a Bill like this to so called ‘protect’ us, it is an insult on our intelligence.

Australians should be free to read any information online and decide for themselves what is true or
false, free from any government intervention.
