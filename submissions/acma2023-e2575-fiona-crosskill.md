**Dear** **Sir/Madam**

**I** **do** **not** **approve** **of** **the** **proposed** **ACMA** **powers** **to** **‘combat** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation’.**

I feel no need to have my ‘safety’ and ‘wellbeing’ protected in any such way. On the contrary, it is
even the suggestion of imposing such extraordinary powers that we need protection from.

**'STICKS** **AND** **STONES** **MAY** **HURT** **OUR** **BONES,** **BUT** **WORDS** **MAY** **NEVER** **HARM** **US’** There’S no need to infantilise
us. We can deal with antagonistic speech, we learn by expressing views, we exercise free choice,
think for ourselves, and forge our own paths.That’s all any government needs to to support.

w e l iv e in **A** d emo c r ac y h er e     - freedom of speech is _foundational;_ so much so that our governments
justify waging war against others that take this freedom from their people. Now our government
plans to wage war against US?

c o r r al l in g **us** in t o o n e o r t h o d o x y when we are proudly multi-cultural reeks of a propaganda
regime, a government that has a plan to control, using a proxy to execute its coercion. All the
fancy offical verbiage cannot disguise this clear intent.

d is c r ed it in g t ar g et ed g r o u ps is the only reason for ever naming something ‘mis’ or
‘dis’-information. An attempt to criminalise dissent and normalise censorship. A government
turning on its own citizens and making them ‘domestic terrorists’ is surely in need of curbing its
paranoia.

**NOMINATING** **A‘MINISTRY** **OF** **TRUTH’** deserves ridicule    - like Alice in Wonderland or ‘1984’...one day
THIS is politically correct and one day THAT is politically correct... Creating a guardian of
orthodoxy is a nonsense authority.

**MAKING** **UNNECESSARY** **EXTRA** **LAWS** when there are already sufficient to cover whatever’s needed.
A changing digital landscape does not necessitate the end of basic rights. The draconian powers
proposed demonstrate either a lack of imagination or evil intent.

**THREAT** **TO** **THE** **OVERALL,** **DIVERSE** **SOCIAL** **MEDIA** **MODEL** with the prospect of enormous fines. Competition to the

BIG tech companies (who easily pay fines or already toe the government line)    - will be silenced. **This** **will** **achieve**
**the** **absolute** **opposite** **of** **'protecting** **democracy'.**
**WRONG** **WAY** **-** **GO** **BACK!**

**Sincerely,**
**Fiona** **Crosskill**

**My** **submission** **can** **be** **made** **public**
