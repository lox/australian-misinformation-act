**RE: Proposed (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill.**

I am writing to say SLOW DOWN, shoving things through the parliament like this is
dangerous, reckless, scary and this bill is downright wrong.

To think that bureaucrats will be the arbitrators of what is TRUE is crazy!!

Free speech is slowly being eroded, and not only in Australia, this is the West worldwide.

The censorship of well renowned professionals, who have proven to be right, is prolific, it
has been sickening to watch the injustices occurring all over the world. Just last week Nigel
Farage is an example, banks closing his accounts??? Is this where we are heading? A
complete police state that destroys dissenters and citizens for holding a different view?

We already have seen the massive government overreach whilst colluding with Big Tech
during the pandemic to censor ordinary people with different views, that was so worrying,
this bill is that on steroids.

How can you allow MSM to be exempt? The trust in MSM is at all time lows, they are
basically a propaganda arm of government these days, pushing the daily required narratives.
Normal Australians are waking up to the rubbish and the blatant corruption occurring daily,
trust in Gov is at all time lows, spending is out of control, and idealists have taken over from
common sense, we are going backwards so fast!

It may sound alarming but we are slowly becoming a communist state, this bill would be
speeding that up even more.

This needs to be thrown out, it has the potential to destroy the free loving, free thinking
way of life Australia has built over the last 200 years.
