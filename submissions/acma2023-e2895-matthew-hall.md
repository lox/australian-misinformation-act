 To Whom it May Concern,
 I believe the proposed bill to be a massive government overreach. Where will this end?  
 Who controls the people that decide what is misinformation or disinformation? 
 This is the thin edge of the wedge; we need to have open debate and discussion and differing opinions. 
 Since when in Australia do we try to silence the people? We are guaranteed freedom of speech in our ORIGINAL constitution to change this the government will need to take this to a referendum. Should the Government charge this freedom and significant
 Itâ€™s quite simple, any act by the government to change our freedom of speech rights which are guaranteed under the Australian Cons6tu6on is a Treasonous Act upon the Australian people.
 We cannot afford to allow this legisla6on to become law.
 Yours truly,
 Ma9hew Hall
