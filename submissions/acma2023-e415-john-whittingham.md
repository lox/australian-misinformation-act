This sounds like a way for the government to entrench their ability to stifle freedom of speech and
punish anyone expressing a different opinion. The covid debacle showed very clearly how the
pharmaceutical companies brainwashed the government to use only their vaccine and disallow
other early (better) treatments, discredited other treatments etc. They were proven wrong and the
whole thing is a great example of how dangerous the lobbyists and representatives of huge
companies are and that they cant be trusted. Further, how easily people including the government
were influenced. This needs to never happen again. Legislation such as this is most likely a step in
the wrong direction unless the covid debacle is recognised as the hazard to us that it was. Any
restrictions need to be exxptrmely moderate an set up so they cant stifle an individual’s freedom of
speech except In extreme cases such as inciting hatred, bullying, racial prejudice, character
assignation, war mongering, the promotion of jihad’s and sharia law agendas etc.

I notice a reluctance on the part of governments to recognise that their behaviour during covid was
foolish and they largely got it wrong, now it appears that they seek to embed it. A better action
would be to ban lobbyists from contact, promotion of self seeking agendas and presence In
parliament house. ugh.
