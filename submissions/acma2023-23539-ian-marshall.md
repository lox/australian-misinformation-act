Having read the proposed bill - i must say it is repugnant to anything related to democracy in
Australia - our country. The very notion that a bureaucratic entity could in some way know the truth
about anything more than anyone else is absurd and repugnant to our rights of free speech.
This is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia
helped to draft in 1948: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

It is also in the Bill of Rights 1688 and is part of our Laws.

The fact that the bill explicitly exempts any government communication, of any level of
government, from being considered misinformation or disinformation, shows how Orwellian this
law will be.

Regardless, this is “my will” to not support any further censorship from an administration such as
the “Government of Australia” (since 1973). Quite simply it is not any part of the role of an
administration to decide what is misinformation and disinformation, truth or lies.

Sincerely,
Ian : Marshall
