To Whom it may Concern

Submission in response to a proposed legislation amendment giving the ACMA new powers to
combat misinformation and disinformation.

It is with great concern that I have become aware of the Commonwealth of Australia (the
Commonwealth) government's intention to amend legislation regarding the combatting of
misinformation and disinformation in the media. I think most people will agree that certain forms of
misinformation and disinformation are present to some extent everywhere in the world. It always
has been and, perhaps, always will.

Promotion of certain idealogical agendas by governments and government agencies, private
corporations, vested interest groups, and individuals is always present. As adults we should be able
to think critically about information we are presented with on a daily basis and discern for ourselves
whether it is worthy of our consideration. This can only be done if the information is made freely
available from multiple sources.

Information is just information. It is neither good nor bad in and of itself, much like a knife, or a rifle.
It is only when information is used by an individual, an organisation or, perhaps, a government or
government agency to nudge, steer, coerce or otherwise interfere with public opinion that it
becomes a problem.

There have been many cases in history where information has been misrepresented in order to have
people behave in a certain way, often with disastrous results. It is only with the benefit of hindsight
many years later that we see the corrupt objectives of the perpetrators.

Deciding that information is misinformation or disinformation for the sake of the common
good/public safety (which has ominously Marxist/socialist overtones) and, supposedly, to help
protect people from harm, where harm is not well defined is a potentially dangerous agenda for the
government to pursue.

Representatives in the federal government have been elected to their positions by the people of the
Commonwealth, are paid by those same people, and are expected to create legislation for the
betterment of those people, not to their detriment. I foresee the strong possibility that, if this
legislation is passed in its current form, it could be used nefariously to attempt to silence dissenting
opinions of government policy, even more than is currently occurring.

As a side note, I am reminded of the recent court ruling in the United States of America prohibiting
the federal government there from being able to influence social media companies. It seems to me

that the Commonwealth government would like to conduct the very same kind of interference that
this ruling prohibits.

The digital platforms used by people wanting to speak and write freely of their opinions on various
topics are, by and large, operated by companies outside the Commonwealth. This brings into
question the reach of Commonwealth legislation across national borders. Surely this behaviour will
not be permitted by other countries' laws. Threats of penalties for non-compliance with the
legislation by these companies would also seem fraught with potential international problems.

I believe that it is each person's individual choice to read, listen to or watch whatever they please
without government interference. As consenting adults we are blessed with the ability to think
critically. It is not the role of government or a government agency to proscribe what information we
may, or may not, be exposed to. The same goes for any opinions that we may wish to express
(obviously, things like incitement to violence and similar well-described crimes should not be
allowed - legislation already exists to deal with these instances).

Freedom of speech is paramount in a fully functioning democracy. The free exchange of ideas is
what brought this country to where it is today (notwithstanding the constitutional problems of
government overreach since 2020).

In summary, it is unnecessary to introduce more top-down authoritarian legislation telling us what
we can and cannot say, hear, see or listen to. We should, instead, be educating and encouraging
people to engage all points of view in order to let them make up their own minds about issues of the
day.

Yours Sincerely

Mark Chaney
