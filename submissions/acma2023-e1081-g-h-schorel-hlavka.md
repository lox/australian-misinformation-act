8 **Re MISINFORMATION BILL, etc**

9 Sir/Madam,

10 a major problem with committees, at least to my experiences, is that members often

11 really do not have a clue as to the true meaning and application of the legal principles embedded

12 in the constitution and then when they read a submission they simply fail to understand what a

13 submission is really about because of their own preconceived views rather than to be and remain

14 openminded. For this this submission will include test for each committee member to (silently

15 perform) see if the committee member is having some basic understanding about what the

16 constitution really stands for.

17 Firstly however, I will make it absolutely clear that no one has the legal rights to interfere with

18 my publications/posts unless a court of competent jurisdiction issue an order to authorise this!

19

20

21

22 This applies to any computer, website, etc, in relation to my person and relevant rights!

23 Hereby you (so AMCA and the AFP), have been provide with a notice that regardless of the

24 purported provisions of the ‘digital misinformation’ bill’/‘digital misinformation’ act’ that

25 any entry upon my computer and/or other personal holding, being it internet accounts,

26 bankholdings, etc, all are deemed unconstitutional/unlawful unless I have provided prior specific

27 consent (not implied consent) will be deemed a violation of my constitutional, legal, human,

2 complaint to the AFP since 6 August 2021, there is a separation of powers which means that the

3 Parliament/Government of the Day cannot give itself authorisation without any specific court

4 order of a Court of competent jurisdiction and the court for this first must hear ‘both sides’.

5 Any purported legislation that pretend to authorise the AFP or whomever to without court order

6 interfere with any Australian their private rights is NULL AND VOID.

7

8 Let there be no mistake, when it comes to land property a police ordinary may enter and via the

9 shortest route to deliver a legal document, however, if a signage at the gate/entrance prohibit

10 entry then no such entry can be legally justified without a court order of a competent court of

11 jurisdiction. When it comes to accessing any person’s computer(s), private internet facilties

12 prohibition applies also.

13

14 Now let do the test, and it must be understood that you are doing the test in silence, not to make

15 known to anyone before seeing the correct answers (shown below)!

16

17 Within the provisions of Section 41 of the **_Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900_**

18 (UK) any person who is an “adult” (as determined from time to time by Commonwealth

19 legislation as to the age applicable) who has franchise:

20

21 A. is lawfully required to vote in federal elections

22 or

23 B. is entitled to vote but doesn’t have to.

24

25 Within the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) a person

26 natural born within a State/Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia:

27

28 A. obtains a nationality as an “Australian citizenship”

29 or

30 B. obtains a nationality of being a “Subject of the British Crown”.

31

32 It is important you do keep the answers to yourself and below I will give the correct answers.

33

34 I January 2021 discovered that Twitter had suspended my right to post any tweets. I filed an

35 appeal but nothing came from this, as they didn’t respond. After Mr Elon Musk purchased

36 Twitter I then forwarded a tweet to him and shortly thereafter I was infored that my Twitter

37 suspension had been in error, and was reinstatated. I was for about 18 months denied to use

38 Twitter and I was obviously wondering why this eventuated.

39

40 I in recent days happen to watch a video of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference

41 through social media where Mr Richard Windeyer, Department of Infrastructure, transport,

42 regional development, communication and the arts was questioned. After this another man made

43 a statement and after that a female made a statement that ACMA (as I understood it) had been in,

44 communcation with Big Tech companies in 2020/2021 about details on platforms it objected

45 against, etc.

46 I now realise that this might have been the real reason my Twitter account was suspended for

47 about 18 months, this as I extensively published material challenging the validity of the

48 purported SARS-CoV-2 alleged virus, etc.

49 Earlier this year I was informed that Facebook removed one of my articles published and I

50 subsequently filed an appeal with Melbourne University so called “Fact checkers” which did not

51 respond whatsoever, at least that I am aware of.

2 While RMIT claims to be “independent” Fact checkers **@therealrukshan who published his**

3 own video’s explained that certain Fact checker actually had their registration expired. Also that

4 ‘Facebook admits the truth: ‘Fact checkers’ are really just (lefty) opinion’ (at 0:21.46 of the

5 video). Meaning that Fact checkers are interfering with not only my constitutional, legal, human,

6 natural and common law rights, but likewise so of others. In my view RMIT or other Fact

7 checkers appears to have a financial incentitive from Big Tech platforms such as Google,

8 Facebook (META), etc, and as such are not at all “INDEPENDENT” as they claim.

9 RMIT actually appears to me to have an IMPLIED bias as it on its webpage shows to be a

10 partnership with Reachout for mental health support to Aboriginal and Torress Strait Islanders

11 people. They also refer to “unceded lands” as such expressing a pro Aboriginal stand.

12

13 In recent years there have been all kinds of State/Territory mandates and thousands upon

14 thousands of Australians have died during this period. My position has been very clear at least

15 since I wrote on 8 April 2020 to the Victorian Ombudsman and 13 April to the Victorian Human

16 Rights Commission that all and any State/Territory mandates were and remain to be

17 unconstitutional and as such States/Territories had no legislative/executive/administrative

18 powers to apply mandates. If therefore ACMA or whomever for and on behalf of the Federal

19 Government interfered with my constitutional, legal, human, natural, common law rights to place

20 my statements on platforms and/or communicate this in other forms to others then I view this is

21 an offence and may constitutute ACMA to have collaborated in mass murder,

22 **TREASON/TERRORISM, etc.**

23

24 Remember my test, I will now show the constitutional correct answers!

25

26 Within the provisions of Section 41 of the **_Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900_**

27 (UK) any person who is an “adult” (as determined from time to time by Commonwealth

28 legislation as to the age applicable) who has franchise:

29

30 C. is lawfully required to vote in federal elections

31 or

32 D. is entitled to vote but doesn’t have to.

33

34 Within the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) a person

35 natural born within a State/Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia:

36

37 C. obtains a nationality as an “Australian citizenship”

38 or

39 D. obtains a nationality of being a “Subject of the British Crown”.

40

41 If you or for that anyone else dispute this then well you may desire to pursue the matter in a

42 court of competent jurisdiction, albeit keep in mind the **_AEC v Schorel-Hlavka 19 July 2006_**

43 litigation where I represented myself defeated the Commonwealth and all 9 Attorney-Generals.

14 Sir,

15 I understand from news report that a special AFP team has been appointed regarding online

16 publications relating to the COVID-19 issue. I view therefore that it is within the AFP

17 investigative powers to investigate all relevant issues and not just those which the Government

18 may desire to be investigating to perhaps aids in its overthrow of the **_Commonwealth of_**

34

35 The purported legislation ‘digital misinformation’ bill’/‘digital misinformation’ act’ is

36 invalid to purport to authorise without a court order to interfere in an Australian’s POLITICAL

37 LIBERTY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, etc. and only a fool would dare to attempt to violate the

3

4 Yet not a single article, to my knowledge was interfered with by the Australian Federal Police

5 and neither was I taken to task before any court of competent jurisdiction regarding my writings

6 published on https://www.scribd.com/inspectorrikati, albeit once in 2010 a judicial officer tried

7 to take me on, when I was representing a party, but miserably failed!

8

9 It may be argued that ACMA itself is not actually deleteing or altering any publications of any

10 Australian as it are the Big Tech, Media and other entities doing so but that is as

correctly pointed out having eventuated in the USA with Big Tech. Acually it is

12 currently a court order existing prohibiting the US government to engage in such conduct. After

13 all what the Federal Government or any Government cannot achieve directly it neither can do so

14 indirectly!

15

16 Again in one of his video’s set out how admitted to

17 have wrongly interfered with posts, etc. Reality is that with the Separation of Powers ACMA

18 cannot engage a third party to do something it cannot do itself. This was the very kind of

19 blackmail/coercion that was engaged in to pursue Australians to be jabbed with the “gene

20 therapy” bioweapon purporting to be a “vaccine” even so it has since been admitted by the

21 (USA) FDA that it is a “bioweapon” and not a vaccine.

22

23 Placing pressure upon a rthird party such as Twitter or other Big Tech so they will then so to say

24 do the dirty work to remove or interfere with publications/post not knowing what is or is legal in

25 Australia is I view a deliberate condeuct of TREASON/TERRORISM.

26

27 Again, Australians have been severely harmed and even died, and still are dying, and many

28 likely because they were denied to make an “informed decision” because plain idiots like those

29 in ACMA, etc, were rather more concerned to pursue the unconstitutional “government policy”

30 to inject all Australians with the **DEPOPULATION bioweapon “gene treatment” then to be**

31 concerned about the **SEVERE HARM being inflicted upon those directly/indirectly being**

32 harmed. Let us not ignore the children who lost their parents having been coerced into being

33 jabbed and then subsequently died, leaving the children without one or more parent(s).

34

35 And this is supposed to be the ACMA which is to be considering what is or is not harmful or

36 might cause severe harm?

37

38 The legal principle of the **_Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) is that We,_**

39 the People, elect our representatives to act on our behalf laws and governance for “peace, order

40 **and good” governance. A** **NEW WORLD ORDER that would defy those legal principles**

41 would be akin to **TREASON by those who are promoting and/or aiding and abetting in this**

42 regard to apply/install the NEW WORLD ORDER.

43 Mr Brad Hazzard (then) purported NSW Minister for Health is recorded at least on 2 videos

44 making known he is using the NEW WORLD ORDER. In my view, this disqualified him from

45 being a Member of any Australian Parliament as provided for in Section 44 of the constitution to

46 which the States within Section 106 are “subject to this constitution”. Likewise, any other

47 purported Member of any Australian Parliament who is aiding and abetting in this

48 **TREASONOUS** conduct.

49

50 While @therealrukshan (Rukshan Fernando) video’s it is claimed that Australians have no Bill

51 or Rights, Freedom of Speech, etc the truth is that they are actually embedded in the

6 When the Australian Electoral Commission charged me AEC v Schorel-Hlavka with FAILING

7 **TO VOTE in the 2001 Federal election, representing myself, I filed and served upon the**

8 Commonwealth and all 9 Attorney-Generals a NOTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER

9 in which I disputed on constitutional grounds the validity of any compulsory voting. I also on

10 constitutional ground challenged the vality of the Commonwealth legislation as to Australian

11 Citizenship being a “nationality”. On 4-12-2002 the Magistrates Court of Victoria at Heidelberg

12 ordered that this **NOTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER was to be heard and**

13 determined by the High Court of Australia! However, the AEC nevertheless charged me again

14 with FAILING TO VOTE in the 2004 Federal election. In the end on 19 July 2006 I defeated

15 both charges without the Commonwealth and/or any of the 9 Attorney-Generals challenging any

16 of my 409 pages written submissions (ADDRESS TO THE COURT).

18 Now, say ACMA came across my claim that compulsory voting is unconstitutional then it may

19 claim this is misinformation/disinformation and people not voting might then end up with serious

20 harm by perhaps some one being elected that may not have been was it not for certain persons

21 not voting because of my writings. Reality is that ACMA is not the venue to make such decision

22 as it lacks the judicial powers and only can petiotion a Court of competent jurisdiction to hear

23 and determine both sides and then issue its orders. It is not for ACMA or some other

24 Government body to interfere with the separation of powers between the legislators, executives,

25 Inter-State Commission and/or judicature. I included the Section 101 Inter-State Commission

26 this because Section 101 stipulated “There shall be” and as such mandatory.

25 I do not think the word quarantine, for instance, which is used in the sub-section of the 52nd

26 clause, is intended to give the Commonwealth power to legislate with regard to any

27 quarantine. That simply applies to quarantine as referring to diseases among man-kind.

30 As mandates for social distancing, jabs, lockdowns, lockouts, ring of steel, 5 km curview, QR

31 code, mask, etc, were all purported to be because of some alleged “infectious disease” then

32 relating to **QUARANTINE it was an exclusive Commonwealth power, since 1908. Therefore**

33 any interference by ACMA and others to collude with Big Tech, Twitter, Facebook, etc, was

34 unlawful because it was interfering with my, and mother Australians rights to communicate with

35 each other.

36

37 On 10 August 2020 the Victorian Police informed me that they would issue a summons for me

38 not wearing a mask, and for being more than 5 kilometres from my residence. They confirmed

39 they were video recording. Well, my response was: “I am ready”. In the end thery never did

40 issue the summons as they likely became aware that I am no push over and they would be

41 looking at losing the case.

11 Therefore, all laws must apply to all citizens regardless if they are directly/indirectly employed

12 and/or being public officials for the Commonwealth and/or State/Territory.

13

14 The legal principle embedded in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) is

15 that all laws must be “UNIFORM”. This means that the application of laws restrictions usage of

16 the internet also must be applied in a “UNIFORM” manner, and **cannot exclude the**

17 Commonwealth and/or the States/Teritories!

18

19 How on earth is ACMA or for that any Big Tech company going to know what is or isn’t

20 misinformation/disinformation when they already proved to lack any proper understanding/

21 comprehension as to the true meaning and application of the legal principles embedded in the

22 **_Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)?_**

23

24 To avoid writing thousands upon thousands of pages of submission I will below quote the

25 relevant links to each document provided as a **COMPLAINT to the Australian Federal Police**

26 and in particular the Supplements numberered **101A, B, C, D, are referring to the**

27 misinformation/ disinformation issues.

29 Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc cannot apply conditions which violates the constitutional,

30 legal, human, natural and/or common law rights of any Australian.

31 For sure, platforms are entitled to delete, restrict, etc, any article/post which may promote

32 paedophilia because it is contrary to Australian law to allow this to be published. As such the

33 terms and conditions of any platform is not whatever they might desire to apply to suit some

34 **WOKE dictatorship demands but rather must always be in according to Australian constitutional**

35 provisions and so any valid law and no other.

36 If a Big Tech desires not wanting to allow a person to publish certain political views merely

37 because they may be contrary to the platform holder then well good riddance of the platform as it

38 then have to pack up and leave as it cannot violate our constitution legal principles.

39 We haver already witnessed how

43 I understand that the Australian Federal Government had and may still have a hotline with Big

44 Tech companies to remove post, etc, and to censor voices of Australians and shutting down

45 debates to promote the Yes vote and prevent the No vote to succeed. This would in my view be

46 an unconstitutional interference with Australians “political rights” and then META be ordered to

47 pack its bags and leave Australia as it cannot operate in defiance of our constitutional provisions

48 and limitations.

4 Let it be very clear that anyone claiming that the Voice is not about “race” is making

5 misinformation/disinformation claims, this as Subsection 51(xxvi) including Aboriginals as a

6 “race”! You cannot have that contradictory provisions are in the one constitution.

8 The Framers of the Constitution also made clear that for any referendum there must be State

9 conventions so that each State can put forwards what they desire, if any, version of referendum.

10 This has not eventuated and so the constitutional process fails to be followed. In fact for years

11 various Elders made clear to me that this Voice was put together exluding them seemingly

12 because their input was not desired as it was not to the views of certain organisers like Thomas

13 Mayo and Teela Reid. In fact Thomas Mayo (on video) as I understood it admitted to have

14 excluded certain Aboriginals for this. As such, this is not some Voice representing all

15 Aboriginals (which includes Torres Strait Islanders) but seems to be the views of a very small

16 minority which Thomas Mayo and Teela Reid seems to dictate.

17

18 It is incomprehensible that “Travelling Pete” Anthony Albanese claims to have been involved in

19 the Voice project for so many years and yet somehow seems to be totally ignorant to what the

20 Voice according to Thomas Mayo and Teela Reid was to accomplish.

2 We also have this issue of the Ukraine NAZI Government where “Travelling Pete” Anthony

3 Albanese is unconstitutionally interfering in a war that he never should have, neither so Scott

4 Morrison and their collaborators. Again is ACMA somehow going to be sitting in judgment

5 about something it has absolutely not a clue what is constitutionally applicable and then pursue

6 Big Tech to unconstitutionally interfere with my and other Australians constitutional rights?

7

8 In my view the misinformation/disinformation Bill proposed legislation is to serve the W.E.F.,

9 U.N., WHO and others to destroy the Commonwealth of Australia’s constitutional system and

10 well the real harm is coming from any politician who join any **TRAITOR/TERRORIST in**

11 seeking to overthrow our constitutional system.

12

13 This is what I view this “racism” is about because the U.N has been pursuing this to my

14 understanding with the con-job 1967 Ss51(xdxvi) referendum. Which allegedly was to give

15 Aboriginals “citizenship” whereas in real terms the opposite was achieved. This as any child

16 born in the States/Territories by birth are “Australian Citizen” not as a nationality but as a citizen

17 of a State/Territory! My published documents set this out extensively and so no need to repeat

18 the same albeit as I made clear it was part of the **_AEC v Schorel-Hlavka cases in which I_**

19 successfully defeate the Commonwealth and all 9 Attorney-Generals. And the fact that I was

20 able to achieve that in itself should underline I at least knew what I was on about and proved that

21 in court.

22

23 Let us concern ourself further with the issue of “SERIOUS HARM”!

24

25 If the Federal Government was really serious about this then why has it in my view

26 unconstitutionally legislated to prevent the list of names (then) **Senator Bill Heffernan placed**

27 on the Senate records about 28 paedophiles in the government and other law enforcement

28 agencies to be sealed for many decades?

29 Surely the last thing one would expect of a Federal Government is to conceal the names of

30 perpetrators of this evil conduct? As such, it cannot be claimed that the Federal Government is

31 really concerned about paedophilia and pursues to avoid “SERIOUS HARM” while shielding

32 paediophiles and perhaps let them continue to pursue their evil conduct?

33

34 We also have to consider the following:

4 **Pedophilia**

5 **Sexual preference for prepubescent children**

6 Overview

7 Summary

8 Pedophilia (alternatively spelt paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or

9 older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent

10 children. Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at

11 age 11 or 12, criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.

12 Pedophilia is a paraphilia. In recent versions of formal diagnostic coding systems such as

13 the DSM-5 and ICD-11, "pedophilia" is distinguished from "pedophilic

14 disorder." Pedophilic disorder is defined a pattern of pedophilic arousal accompanied by

15 either subjective distress or interpersonal difficulty, or having acted on that arousal. The

16 DSM-5 requires that a person must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older

17 than the prepubescent child or children they are aroused by, for the attraction to be

18 diagnosed as pedophilic disorder. Similarly, the ICD-11 excludes sexual behavior among

19 post-pubertal children who are close in age. The DSM requires the arousal pattern must be

20 present for 6 months or longer, while the ICD lacks this requirement. The ICD criteria also

21 refrain from specifying chronological ages.

22 In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or

23 the act of child sexual abuse, including any sexual interest in minors below the local age of

24 consent, regardless of their level of physical or mental development. This use conflates the

25 sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse and fails to

26 distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors.

27 Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided, because although some

28 people who commit child sexual abuse are pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not

29 pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent

30 children, and many pedophiles do not molest children.

31 Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant

32 amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly

33 documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, and researchers

34 assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. No cure

35 for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of

36 a person committing child sexual abuse. The exact causes of pedophilia have not been

37 conclusively established. Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated

38 it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies.

10 Let those purusing this alleged legislation prove it did not act in collaboration to others to

11 achieve precisely the opposite then what it claimed to do, such as to avoid harm to Australians,

12 avoid hospitals to be overwhelmed, etc.

13 Let those pushing the environment issue prove that weather current conditions are actually much

14 worse then thay were more than 600 years ago!

15 Let those climate alarmist show what they did to deal with the Nord Stream 1 & 2 destruction

16 and the man made environmental disaster and hold the culprit legally accountable!

17 Numerous other issues are to be canvassed including the unconstitutional conduct by the

16 From Make Australians Healthy Again

17 THERE IS NO SARSCOV2 VIRUS And hence, there is no Covid19 Pandemic

18 It is all a huge fraud

19 All thanks to a wonderful German Engineer, Marvin Haberland, and a great American

20 researcher Christine Massey and an incredible German biologist, Dr Stefan Lanka and

21 many others.

22 Christine has proved through hundreds of FOI requests and responses, that the

23 SARSCOV2 virus has never been isolated anywhere in the World.

24 See

26 When Greg Hunt, the then Australian Federal Health Minister was questioned by Solihin

27 Millin he responded with a pathetic letter (see https://bit.ly/3JVOYGf) stating he was

28 unable to prove the explicit existence of the SARSCOV2 virus other than through citing

29 the results of a single pseudo-scientific experiment carried out by the Doherty Institute

30 associated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. (Editor: The Doherty Institute

31 had connections to US biolabs in Ukraine)

32 For the results of a scientific experiment to be validated a second precisely similar

33 experiment must be carried out without introducing the supposed causative agent, in the

34 case of the Doherty Institute, a human sample supposed to be infected with the

35 SARSCOV2 virus.

36 Marvin Haberland was astute enough to question this Doherty Institute pseudo-experiment,

37 and the Doherty Institute under FOI (Freedom of Information) confirmed that the

38 **Doherty Institute never carried out a control experiment, thereby scientifically**

39 invalidating their findings.

40 Further, a great German biologist Dr Stefan Lanka showed through running the missing

41 Doherty Institute control experiment that the results using a placebo (inert substance)

42 resulted in exactly the same experimental outcome. (see https://bit.ly/40GjThN)

11 Marvin Haberlandhas won his case in Germany heard on the 26th April 2023.

12 This is now hard scientific and legal evidence for MAHA to raise in our up and coming

13 Australian Federal Court Class Action that the SARSCOV2 virus does not exist.

14 Hence Covid19 does not exist since it is meant to be caused by the non-existent

15 SARSCOV2 virus.

16 And hence Covid19 is a total fraud.

17 In addition there is a great deal of proof that the PCR test and associated false positives

18 that was used to create the false Covid19 cases, is completely false and cannot be used to

19 test for a disease.

20 A Portuguese court confirmed this – see https://bit.ly/41VMK2E

21 As did a request for retraction of the original Drostin paper recommending the PCR test to

22 test for SARSCOV2 and hence Covid19

23 (see https://bit.ly/3Lx5lNb and https://bit.ly/3NipFDo)

24 Further huge amounts of evidence are available to MAHA confirming that the Covid19

25 Plandemic has been falsely constructed to enable the distribution of otherwise illegal, dual

26 purpose gain of function poisonous bio-warfare mRNA based nanotechnology gene

27 altering injections and other lethal and harmful nano substances by the United States of

28 America Department of Defence.

29 What has been called the SARSCOV2 virus is a chimeric (made by humans) in silico (only

30 exists in computers, created by human imagination) biological poison developed for bio
31 warfare. (see https://bit.ly/3zHGuQ6)

32 We’ve won

33 In addition we have hard evidence that the Australian TGA has hidden death statistics in

34 order to support the false Australian Government Covid19 injection narrative.

35 (see https://bit.ly/3Lb4791 and https://bit.ly/3LubEBb)

36 With these simple facts which will be presented via the MAHA Class Action to the

37 Australian Federal Court we have proved the falsity of the entire Covid19 Plandemic

38 Australians rejoice

39 You are about to be compensated for this hugely destructive shocking lethal and injurious

40 fraud that the Australian Governments have inflicted on us all.

10 **Reason for the objection:**

11 1. the penalty notice is unlawful.

12 2. according to §1 IfSG applies:

13 (1) The purpose of the law is to prevent communicable diseases in humans, to detect

14 infections at an early stage and to prevent their further spread.

15 (2) The necessary cooperation and collaboration of federal, state and local authorities,

16 physicians, veterinarians, hospitals, scientific institutions and other stakeholders should be

17 **organized and supported in accordance with the respective state of medical and**

18 **epidemiological science and technology.**

19 3. the German Research Foundation (DFG) published guidelines to ensure good scientific practice as

20 early as 1998. When the Code comes into force on August 1, 2019, all universities and non
21 university research institutions must implement the 19 guidelines and their explanatory notes in

22 a legally binding manner (see Proposal for Evidence 1a). According to the DFG, the general

23 principles of scientific work include:

24 ∙ Lege artis to work

25 ∙ **Document results**

26 ∙ **Consistently self-doubt all results**

27 According to the DFG, the following also applies: "Even in fields of work where intense

28 **competition forces researchers to publish as quickly as possible, the quality of the work and**

29 **the publication must be the top priority. Results must be checked and replicated wherever**

30 **actually possible before they are submitted for publication." (see Request for Evidence 1b)**

31 Guideline 11 of the Code (Methods and Standards) states, "Many methods used in life science projects

32 **have limitations. The strengths and weaknesses of a method should be considered in the choice of**

33 **method, documented, and balanced by appropriate controls.** " (see Evidence Request 1c)

34 The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has also been committed to the DFG rules since May 2002.

35 According to the RKI, this serves scientific self-control (see Proposition of Evidence 1d).

36 **The virologists did not act according to the state of the art of medical and epidemiological science**

37 **and technology, as required by §1 IfSG, because they did not control and document their methods**

38 **and results.**

39 **To prove my case, I submit the following evidentiary motions:**

40 1. in order to prove that the state of the art in science and technology requires that its

41 results be consistently self-doubted, checked and documented, I request that the following

42 documents or sources be included:

43 (3) "Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice" of the German Research

44 Foundation (DFG), available at

4 (6) The RKI also acknowledges and commits to compliance with the DFG guidelines, which

5 can be read at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Forsch/Grundlagen/grundlagennode.html

6 2. to prove that virologists do not control and document their methods, I request the

7 inclusion of the following document:

8 The attached document is a responded Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by

9 Australia's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne.

10 Researchers at the Doherty Institute began publishing the document in early 2020 with the

11 publication of

12 "Isolation and rapid sharing of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from the first patient

13 diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia" published one of the world's authoritative publications

14 on the claimed pathogen detection for the so-called "SARS-CoV-2" virus. The questioner asked

15 the authors of the study whether they had performed and documented the scientifically

16 prescribed control experiments for their methods. According to the authors, no control

17 **experiments were documented throughout the publication and were not performed for the**

18 **whole genome sequencing. Thus, two central components of the scientific method are violated**

19 (documentation and control).

20 3. to prove that none of the published studies on the so-called pathogen detection for "Sars
21 CoV-2" includes performed and documented control experiments for the methods used 
22 including genome sequencing.

23 I request that the court obtain a factual opinion from a SARS-Cov-2 virologist on this

24 matter. The SARS-CoV-2 virologist should provide evidence, based on at least one

25 original scientific publication, that a viral structure designated as SARS-CoV-2 was

26 discovered through isolation and biochemical characterization of its components. The

27 **scientific publication must include the performance and documentation of all control**

28 **experiments.**

37 I have followed up with the Doherty Institute in response to your final question. The answer below was

38 provided:

39 At the time there was no established method for sequencing SARS -CoV-2 In order to maximise the

40 number of sequencing reads for nCoV2019 (named at the time) we elected to dedicate an entire flow cell

41 to the positive culture sample to maximise our recovery of the viral reads and not spend reads on

42 sequencing a negative sample.

5 Dear,

6 Apologies for the delay in response - I have made some preliminary enquiries and write to advise that the

7 Doherty Institute can provide the following answers to your questions regarding the "Isolation and rapid

8 sharing of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS- CoV- 2) from the first patient diagnosed with COVID- 19

9 in Australia" publication.

10

11 (7) Can you confirm that the negative control culture was grown in the same conditions

12 (37°C, 5% CO2) and maintenance media (consisting of 10mL EMEM, 7% FBS, 2mM L-L
13 glutamine,, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1500mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 15 mM HEPES and

14 0.4mg/ml geneticin) to 95% confluency in 25cm2 flasks, and that, for the negative control,

15 maintenance media was removed and 10 mL viral culture media (EMEM as above but FBS

16 reduced to 2%) was added?

17 As background, Doherty researchers define a control to be a component of an experiment intended to

18 eliminate alternative explanations for experimental results, due to 'confounding variables'. It does this by

19 as closely as is feasible replicating all components of the experiment other than the variable being

20 measured. In this case, it means our negative controls have been treated in the same media conditions

21 and changes as our positives.

22 2. Could you please provide me with the exact documentation of the negative

23 control experiment. There is no specific documentation for this experiment. Assuming

24 your question relates to the methodology used to create this control, these are not

25 documented or included in publications. As mentioned above, they are presumed to follow

26 as much as it is feasible the original experiment, replicating all components of the

27 experiment other than the variable being measured.

28 3. Regarding genome sequencing from the infected cell culture, did you perform

29 control experiments to exclude that also other virus genomes could have been assembled

30 de novo or via alignment using other reference genomes? We did not look for other viral

31 genomes. Our assembly was performed against the released Wuhan -1-1 reference sequence as

32 we were looking for SARS-CoV-2.

33 4. Did you perform control experiments to exclude that the target virus genome

34 could have been assembled de novo or via alignment from the negative control culture?

35 Sequencing and denovo assembly was only performed on positive, infected material.

36 5. If the answer for 3. and 4. is yes, could you please provide to me the documented

37 negative control procedure for the genome sequencing?

38 N/A - see responses to 3 and 4.

39 I trust these responses satisfy your queries. Kind regards,

23 proposed law has to go through, and the opportunity afforded to a member of either House

24 or a member of the Executive to call attention to any infraction or infringement of the

25 Constitution. It does not require a majority of the members of the House of Representatives

26 to insist that the Constitution shall be obeyed in the matter of procedure; it only requires

27 **one solitary member to rise to a point of order, and the Speaker has to give a legal**

28 interpretation of the rules of procedure. It only requires one member of the Senate to

29 **call the attention of the President to the fact that a Bill is introduced contrary to the**

30 **Constitution for that proposed law to be ruled out of order. It does not require a**

31 **majority of the states to insist that the Constitution shall be obeyed, because a**

32 **majority of the states cannot by resolution infringe the Constitution. Neither House**

33 could pass the standing order which would give the majority power to dissent from the

4 made to then place the matter before the High Court of Australia for its advise as to any disputed

5 part of a Bill being within constitutional powers. This is not that the House of Representatives

7 clear the matter should be placed before the High Court of Australia! While a Speaker/President

24 Hence, the majority of a vote by the Members of either House of Parliament never can overrule

25 the obligation of the Speaker/President to pursue a clarification of what is held to be

26 constitutionally appropriate. Any so called “sweethart deal” to have an objecter drop its

27 objection is of no legal value becdause once the objection is made it no longer is in the hands of

28 the objector but is than in the hands of the Speaker/President and this Speaker/President must

29 than pursue the constitutional validity of such Bill. The same is with the Chairman of any

30 Committee! Hence my **SUBMISSION cannot be ignored but the Chairman of the Committee**

5 **Arthur massacre as to pursue to remove the weapons from ordinary Australians for their**

6 **DEPOPULATION** agenda. This, where I understand that some 10 years prior to the **Port**

7 **Arthur massacre a NSW Premnier than allegedly made known that to remove weapons from**

8 citizens there was a need for a **Port Arthur massacre! I understand from a video details that a**

9 special truck was ordered to be build in advance for this very purpose to transport the huge

10 number of dead boddies from **Port Arthur massacre area. As such, what eventuated in Port**

11 Arthur was planned well in advance and the alleged killer had to my understanding absolutely no

12 involvement in ordering such a truck beforehand!

13

14 It appears to me that the same was planned beforehand such as with **2010 LockStep to mass**

15 murder citizens around the world as my COMPLAINT to R Kershaw Chief Commissioner of

16 **AFP makes very clear!**

18 I understand from a video that Anthony Albanese prior to the purported 2022 federal election

19 made clear that he didn’t want to change policies but merely to be Prime Minister. By this, and

20 his previous silence about the unconstitutional covid scam mandates, etc, underlines to me he

21 and his collaborators are all part of the TRAITORS/TERRORIST and none of those pretending

22 to be in the Parliament are constitutionally permitted to be so by Sections 44 & 45 of the

23 constitution.

26 advised by her specialist to have the “vaccine” (meaning the DEPOPULATION “gene therapy”

27 bioweapon owned by the DoD (USA) just that he couldn’t explain any harm to my wife if she

28 had such an injection.

29 The Victorian Government even had a mandate that only one person of a household was allowed

30 to go for essentials. This kind of **TERRORISM is unforgiveraqble and if I have my way each**

33 lived through WWII and actually had 3 bombs destroyiung 3 underground bunkers her

34 farmer/lawyer father had for his workforce and family. Just that on that particular day he directed

35 all to shelter in the main house instead of the bunkers. To Olga the **TERRORISM by the**

36 Victorian Government and others was far worse to her then what she lived through during

37 WWII! During 2020 even gave me the understanding she wanted to die because of the

38 mandates preventing her to live a normal right. I was there to assist her through this difficult time

39 but many others who were living on their own simply may have caved in.

40 Despite the unconstitutional restrictions a violation of separation of powers the State and neither

41 the Federal Government provided any assistance to the citizens in ill health and/or suffering from

42 health issues as their mentality appears to me to be you can die if you do not have the “gene

43 therapy” bioweapon injection!

44

45 Premier Danial Andrews appears to claim he is sorry about what was done with the mandates but

46 is still pursuing the **2010 LockStep of the W.E.F. plan to be implemented, and that to me**

47 underlines that he as many other politicians around the world are claiming to be sorry while in

48 reality they continue their evil doings. That is why he and others and their collaborators all needs

49 to be held legally accountable. This is a pinnacle of TERRORISM which understand in certain

50 manner still continue until this day.

11 hospital refused to give her the medical treatment she required against cancer unless she was

12 injected. So, she was coerced to be injected. After that gave me the understanding that the

13 treatment was a success as she was in remission. Thereafter, I was given the understanding that

14 was in hospital on her deathbed because the cancer suddenly had returned and now

15 throughout her entire body. Soon thereafter she died. This is not an isolated case because I

16 understand that in Victoria a woman needing a transplant was denied this because the medical

17 staff refuses to perform the transplant unless she has the covid injection (“gene therapy”

18 **DEPOPULATION bioweapon injection), THIS SHE REFUSED.**

47 then were)! The Governor-General to my understanding had not published any

49 and as such any military and other financial involvement was unconstitutional.

32 I shall quote from Mr. Dicey's recent work, which is very clear in its language. He says:

33 **One of the characteristics of a federation is that the law of the constitution must be either legally**

34 **immutable or else capable of being changed only by some authority above and beyond the ordinary**

35 **legislative bodies, whether federal or state legislatures, existing under the constitution.**

39 QUOTE **Mr. THYNNE:**

40 **The constitution of this federation will not be charged with the duty of resisting privileged classes, for**

41 **the whole power will be vested in the people themselves. They are the complete legislative power of the**

42 **whole of these colonies, and they shall be so. From [start page 106] them will rise, first of all, the federal**

43 constitution which we are proposing to establish, and in the next place will come the legislative powers of the

44 several colonies. The people will be the authority above and beyond the separate legislatures, and the

45 royal prerogative exercised, in their interest and for their benefit, by the advice of their ministers will be

46 practically vested in them. They will exercise the sovereignty of the states, they will be charged with the

47 full power and dignity of the state, and it is from them that we must seek the giving to each of those bodies

48 that will be in existence concurrently the necessary powers for their proper management and existence. Each

49 **assembly, each legislature, whether state or federal existing under this constitution, will be as Dicey**

50 **again says-a merely subordinate law-making body whose laws will be valid, whilst within the authority**

51 **conferred upon it by the constitution, but invalid and unconstitutional if they go beyond the limits of**

52 **such authority.**

53 END QUOTE

55 I may underlines that neither the ‘No’ or the ‘Yes’ case in my view can be deemed legally valid

56 where even the No case seems to portray that it will agree for a recognition of Aboriginals

57 (including Torres Strait Islanders) on its own. There is no such constitutional provision to amend

5 Would any politician (and so their collaborators) be willing to fly with an aeroplane which I had

6 been tinkering with without being a duly qualified mechanic and not knowing how the hell any

7 changes I made would result to any harm once the plane was able to take off? Well, instead of

8 the aeroplane now consider the same regarding the **_Commonwealth of Australia Constitution_**

9 **_Act 1900 (UK). No one, and this includes the very former High Court of Australia judges as well_**

10 as those calling themselves “constitutional lawyers” (an oxymoron like a Firefighter

11 Firebug)seem to have a comprehensive understanding of the legal principles embedded in the

12 constitution!

13

14 I above put the test about citizenship and let consider the following what it actually stands for:

15

16 **Hansard 2-3-1898 Constitution Convention Debates**

17 QUOTE

18 **Mr. SYMON.-Very likely not. What I want to know is, if there is anybody who will**

19 come under the operation of the law, so as to be a citizen of the Commonwealth, who

20 would not also be entitled to be a citizen of the state? There ought to be no opportunity for

21 such discrimination as would allow a section of a state to remain outside the pale of the

22 Commonwealth, except with regard to legislation as to aliens. Dual citizenship exists,

23 but it is not dual citizenship of persons, it is dual citizenship in each person. There may

24 **be two men-Jones and Smith-in one state, both of whom are citizens of the state, but**

25 **one only is a citizen of the Commonwealth. That would not be the dual citizenship**

26 **meant. What is meant is a dual citizenship in Mr. Trenwith and myself. That is to say,**

27 **I am a citizen of the state and I am also a citizen of the Commonwealth; that is the**

28 **dual citizenship. That does not affect the operation of this clause at all. But if we**

29 introduce this clause, it is open to the whole of the powerful criticism of Mr. O'Connor and

30 those who say that it is putting on the face of the Constitution an unnecessary provision,

31 and one which we do not expect will be exercised adversely or improperly, and, therefore,

32 it is much better to be left out. Let us, in dealing with this question, be as careful as we

33 possibly, can that we do not qualify the citizenship of this Commonwealth in any way or

34 exclude anybody [start page 1764] from it, and let us do that with precision and clearness.

35 **As a citizen of a state I claim the right to be a citizen of the Commonwealth. I do not**

36 **want to place in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament, however much I may be**

37 **prepared to trust it, the right of depriving me of citizenship. I put this only as an**

38 argument, because no one would anticipate such a thing, but the Commonwealth

39 Parliament might say that nobody possessed of less than £1,000 a year should be a citizen

40 of the Federation. You are putting that power in the hands of Parliament.

41 **Mr. HIGGINS.-Why not?**

42 **Mr. SYMON.-I would not put such a power in the hands of any Parliament. We must**

43 **rest this Constitution on a foundation that we understand, and we mean that every**

44 **citizen of a state shall be a citizen of the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth**

45 **shall have no right to withdraw, qualify, or restrict those rights of citizenship, except**

46 **with regard to one particular set of people who are subject to disabilities, as aliens,**

47 **and so on.**

21 as the arbiter of the Constitution. . It is appointed not to be above the Constitution, for

22 **no citizen is above it, but under it;** **but it is appointed for the purpose of saying that**

23 **those who are the instruments of the Constitution-the Government and the**

24 **Parliament of the day-shall not become the masters of those whom, as to the**

25 **Constitution, they are bound to serve.** **What I mean is this: That if you, after making**

26 **a Constitution of this kind, enable any Government or any Parliament to twist or**

27 **infringe its provisions, then by slow degrees you may have that Constitution-if not**

28 **altered in terms-so whittled away in operation that the guarantees of freedom which**

29 **it gives your people will not be maintained; and so, in the highest sense, the court you**

30 are creating here, which is to be the final interpreter of that Constitution, will be such a

31 tribunal as will preserve the popular liberty in all these regards, and will prevent,

10 to seek to implement them where they are or might be in conflict with our constitution. The

11 various videos I watched about him he seems to express no more but certain desires to achieve

12 what he wish to achieve and even his statement to ‘punish politicians” may mean to be no more

13 but to not vote for certain politicians. The issue is not if I agree or disagree with some or all

14 elements othe views he expresses as that is totally irrelevant. He exercises no more but his

15 constitutional rights and is entitled to do so. However, politicians who may pursue to implement

32 conduct and let DICTATORSHIP & TERRORISM be the rule of the day.

40 **Why is it legal to tell lies during the Voice referendum campaign?**

41 QUOTE

42 Accusations of misinformation and disinformation are already flying in the Voice to

43 Parliament campaign - and often with good reason. Unfortunately for voters, though, there

44 is little to stop anyone from telling lies about the Voice or spreading disinformation –

45 constitutional law expert Luke Beck explains, it’s perfectly legal to do so.

46 END QUOTE

47

48 Currently the eSafety Commission seems to be bias as to take the side of the federal government

49 to pursue that Voice at all cost be implemented into the Constitution no matter the **scam that is**

50 used to seek to convince electors to vote for it, rather than to make clear that any publication

51 must be reflecting the truth and failing this the Courts may hold asny person providing

52 misleading information and/or concealing relevant details legally accountable. We cannot have

53 that the eSafety Commission blatantly disregard responsibility to act ‘IMPARTIAL”!

2 is in my view grossly incompetent!

3

4 It should be understood that there is no such thing as a “Labor Government” or a “Coalition

5 Government” this because those in Government are commissioned by the Governor-General in

6 the Commonwealth and by the Governor in a State to be “constitutional advisors”!

8 **HANSARD 4-3-1891 Constitution Convention Debates**

9 QUOTE  Sir HENRY PARKES:

10 The resolutions conclude:

11 An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such persons as may from time to

12 time be appointed as his advisers, such persons sitting in Parliament, and whose term of

13 office shall depend upon their possessing the confidence of the house of representatives

14 expressed by the support of the majority.

15 What is meant by that is simply to call into existence a ministry to conduct the affairs of

16 the new nation as similar as it can be to the ministry of England-a body of constitutional

17 advisers who shall stand as nearly as possible in the same relation to the representative of

18 the Crown here [start page 27] a her Majesty's imperial advisers stand is relation to the

19 Crown directly. These, then, are the principles which my resolutions seek to lay down as a

20 foundation, as I have already stated, for the new super structure, my object being to invite

21 other gentlemen to work upon this foundation so as to best advance the ends we have in

22 view.

23 END QUOTE

25 **HANSARD 17-2-1898 Constitution Convention Debates**

26 QUOTE  Mr. OCONNOR.
27 We must remember that in any legislation of the Commonwealth we are dealing with the

28 Constitution. Our own Parliaments do as they think fit almost within any limits. **In this**

29 **case the Constitution will be above Parliament, and Parliament will have to conform**

30 **to it.**

31 END QUOTE

33 **HANSARD** **_9-2-1898_** **Constitution Convention Debates**


34 QUOTE

35 **Mr. HIGGINS.-No, because the Constitution is not passed by the Parliament.**

38 **HANSARD** _1-3-1898 Constitution Convention Debates_

39 QUOTE

40 **Mr. GORDON.- The court may say-"It is a good law, but as it technically infringes on the Constitution**

41 **we will have to wipe it out."**

42 END QUOTE

43

44 Those whom are commissioned as Ministers are therefore not commissioned to pursue their

45 political goals but to assist the Governor-General in the Commonwealth or the Governor in a

46 State to advise them in management of any portfolio to what the relevant constitution(s) permits.

47 While Ministers m

48 ay have certain political goals of a personal level they however cannot interfere with the

49 Ministers constitutional obligations. If the Minister acts in violation of his/her constitutional

50 obligations then the Minister and his/her officials can be held legally accountable.

51

52 My constitutional rights are enshrined in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900

53 (UK) and the purported legislation therefore is ULTRA VIRES Ab Initio where it pursued to act

54 in violation of my constitutional, legal, human, natural and common law rights.
