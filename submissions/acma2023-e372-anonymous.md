My name is, I am years old and live in the council area of . I am an Australian citizen.

I'd like to object to this Exposure Draft for the following reasons:

1. Freedom of speech and expression must always be protected. If we are to live in a free and democratic society we need
free media and free and open discussion and in the modern world that means free social and digital media. No matter the
costs or alleged costs.
2. While there may be so-called dangers to allowing free speech and free expression on digital platforms the pros far
outweigh the cons in a free, democratic, and thriving society.
3. Who decides what is right and wrong? There is no agreed-upon definition of misinformation in this context. The ACMA
are all appointed, they are not elected. What are their politics? What if we disagree? How can one body decide what is
right or wrong? No single body or organisation of unelected persons should be able to decide what is misinformation or
disinformation. The people themselves are smart enough to decide this for themselves and there should be agreed upon
terms and definitions by the public.
4. The fact sheet provided by the ACMA does not provide any evidence for their claims, for example: "' 4-in-5 Australian
adults have seen misinformation about COVID-19, with 22% seeing ‘a lot’ or ‘a great deal’". There is no good evidence
to back this up. The methodology only looked at a tiny minuscule fraction of Australia, only 2,659 people, this is
impossible and unreliable to state something as fact based on 2,659 people and without knowing what they were asked or
what that alleged misinformation was.
5. The ACMA tries to connect completely unrelated topics such as Covid 19 alleged misinformation, which they never stated
what the misinformation was, with the completely unrelated US Capitol riots as if the Capitol riots alleged danger was
somehow to do with Covid 19 misinformation.
6. There are better methods for fighting so-called and alleged misinformation and disinformation such as fact-checking,
community notes, prebunks, debunks, debates, reporting and ranking improvements.

I object.
