Good afternoon

Please find my submission response to the "new ACMA powers to combat misinformation & disinformation". Please
DO NOT PUBLISH my name, email address, postal address or mobile number.

Free speech is an important part of a democratic society, such as we currently enjoy in Australia today. It is important
that people are allowed to express their views and have debate and discussion without fear of prosecution, should
their views not align with the government of the time. Monitoring and restricting free speech would be more expected
in a communist society.

Therefore I do not consent to these proposed laws & I oppose them.
