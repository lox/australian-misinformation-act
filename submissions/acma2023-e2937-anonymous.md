To Whom it may concern :

The Government is NOT the arbiter of all that is true and right in society or science and to believe otherwise is Totalitarian
in its purpose .

I wish to register my objection to the proposed legislation . Any government controlled legislation that has an aim to censor
speech and debate on any subject that they don’t agree with or somehow deem misinformation is totalitarian in its very
purpose . Truth in science or any area for that matter can only be fully arrived at by a free and open debate of ideas .
The absolute risk with what would be a very dangerous legislation is the censorship of real science and medicine that doesn’t
follow the orthodoxy . During the pandemic Nobel Laureates , Professors of medicine and research science plus scores of
other medical professionals were censored for just holding opinions outside of the orthodoxy that was deemed to be
misinformation . This is Dangerous and Totalitarian in nature .

Misinformation ,untruths or outright dishonest lies should only be countered with the real information or factual truths .
Whilst it can be rightly argued that during the recent pandemic there were some patently incorrect information being touted
on social media , it is social media . It would be far more sensible to licence or make identities for people using social media
be made available to all, so as to obstruct people hiding behind false identities and expose their bonafides .

Kind Regards
