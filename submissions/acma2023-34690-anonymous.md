I am concerned that the powers granted to ACMA could be misused to suppress both
legitimate speech and respectfully dissenting opinions. Freedom of speech is essential
for a thriving democracy, as it encourages open debate, the exchange of ideas, and the
ability to provide feedback and hold those in power accountable to those they
represent.

By granting the ACMA the authority to enforce measures against misinformation and
disinformation, I am concerned about a negative impact on public discourse, where the
people of Australia may become hesitant to express their opinions or to engage in
controversial discussions, hindering the diversity of perspectives necessary for a
healthy democracy, which could have dangerous and long-lasting impacts on the basic
freedoms of individuals. Without robust safeguards and clear definitions, there is a
danger of legislative overreach and subjective enforcement of implementation
measures.

Determining what content falls under the categories of misinformation and
disinformation can be highly subjective and open to interpretation. This subjectivity
leaves room for potential abuse and discrimination unless transparent guidelines are
established, ensuring all citizens' rights to freedom of speech, which the Federal
Government is covenanted into protecting.

The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 could have
unintended negative consequences in that it may have a paralysing effect on
innovation, creativity, and the free flow of information, hindering the positive
contributions of online platforms and stifling the progress of the many thinking
individuals we have in our society.

I am respectfully ask that you represent my will with regard to this important upcoming
proposed bill, which is a brazen imposition on our rights, and I urge you oppose the bill
and to point out with clarity the backward step Australia would be taking should this
legislation go ahead. Thank you.
