DISINFORMATION

THE MAIN ISSUE

THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF AN ENTITY POSSESSING THE POWER AND KNOWLEDGE TO
DETERMINE CORRECT INFORMATION _ON_ _ANY_ _MATTERS_ _AT_ _ANY_ _TIME_

THE OMNIPOTENCE ASSUMPTION

The main problem with the proposed legislation is the assumption underlying same. This
assumption is that the ACMA would have an inerrant and omnipotent knowledge and
understanding of being able to determine what is "misinformation and disinformation'
pertaining to _any_ _subject_ _or_ _matter_ _or_ _item_ _of_ _debate_ _at_ _any_ _one_ _time,_ and as such, is
capable of determining what would be "misinformation or disinformation" conclusively;
or indeed has the capacity of conclusively determining the opposite of same, being what
could be described as "correct information". Those publishing the perceived
misinformation or disinformation are under the threat of major financial penalty for
publishing the DEEMED misinformation or disinformation and accordingly will act as
censors stifling free speech so as to avoid being massively fined as is proposed.

These proposed powers would make the ACMA the most powerful entity in Australian
society as the bill would effectively institute a regime _to_ _control_ _the_ _free_ _flow_ _of_ _ideas,_
_knowledge,_ _opinions_ _and_ _discourse_ _between_ _citizens,_ _due_ _to_ _the_ _fear_ _imposed_ _upon_ _social_
_media_ _outlets_ _of_ _incurring_ _significant_ _and_ _potentially_ _ruinous_ _financial_ _penalty_ _for_
_publishing_ _deemed_ _misinformatiom/disinformation._

Social media companies will then become de-facto government censors fearing financial
retribution if the information published could be deemed misinformation or
disinformation by the ACMA, or potentially for merely beong contrary to a prevailing
narrative. The bill will thus stifle free speech, the expression of competing ideas and
ultimately the quest to improve the human condition. Where freedom of thought
flourishes the recipient populus flourishes. Such is the cornerstone of western liberalism.
The proposed bill is the antithesis of what has made western civilisation great.

The question that further arises from same, is how could the ACMA or any authority or
entity, statutory or otherwise, be able to conclusively determine what is misinformation
and disinformation _at_ _any_ _one_ _time_ _on_ _any_ _matter,_ when the history of the evolution of
knowledge, is that knowledge is always changing in light of new discoveries, new
revelations or things that were previously not known ;or relevant information that was
previously or even contemporaneously hidden, partly or wholly, from public knowledge
or discourse. Further there is the question of competing or contrary facts, the relative
value or weight attributed to such competing facts, and the question of subjective
assessment of competing facts or information.


-----

Some ancient Greeks consulted the Oracle at Delphi for such definitive knowledge and
guidance. The proposed role of the ACMA is no different than the belief of these ancient
Greeks, in that apparently the ACMA will be endowed with _all-encompassing_ _knowledge_
_as_ _to_ _information._ The underlying pre-supposition is that the ACMA will have knowledge
the equivalent of a mythological entity; _and_ _at_ _all_ _times_ _and_ _on_ _all_ _matters,_ _can_ _determine_
_misinformation_ _and_ _disinformation_ _from_ _correct_ _information._ The writer cannot do this
,nor can any reader of this submission. How then could the ACMA have such capacity?

In this submission, the underlying assumption as to the capacity of the _ACMA_ _as_
_effectively_ _the_ _final_ _arbiter_ _of_ _truth,_ is preposterous and contrary to the human experience
and history.

RELATED ISSUES

THE PROBLEM OF OBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVITY

One problem with determining misinformation or disinformation from correct information
involves issues relating to objectivity and subjectivity when assessing the subject matter.

This can occur with competing facts or contrary facts supporting different conclusions
regarding a subject matter. Therefore it is common to have two contrarian views both
supported by different facts or interpretation of facts.
Determining what is correct information or misinformation or disinformation, is then
difficult to determine and a determination regarding the topic could well be subjective
having regard to the knowledge or biases inherent in the adjudication process.

One arbiter may favour a certain view or interpretation giving facts that support their
conclusion, higher value than competing facts. In such a situation of competing facts and
interpretation it is a matter of logic that there should be no definitive view as to what is
correct information or disinformation as same cannot be conclusively determined whilst
information is in a state of flux.
However a body such as the ACMA could well determine in such as area of dispute, that
one view or interpretation is misinformation of disinformation due to a subjective bias.
Such a determination could be consistent with a "prevailing narrative" that may be
commonly accepted related to the area of dispute.
Such conflicts would potentially give rise to a corruption of the process and government
authorities could give preference to giving a determination as to misinformation when it is
politically expedient or supports government initiatives or policy. For example if there are
competing views as to the effectiveness of lockdown measures during a pandemic, the
process could be tainted by a determination of a view as misinformation, if information
was viewed as undermining government pandemic policy. Here I cite the well known
academic research of Professor Gigi Foster of University of NSW and the Harvard
University Study indicating the ineffectiveness of the lockdowns during the pandemic.
Views and speech consistent with these studies could well have been deemed
misinformation by a body such as the ACMA, and such an adjudication would of course
been wrong and reprehensible.

FACTS EVOLVE AND NEW FACTS       - THAT IS NEW INFORMATION, IS DISCOVERED OVER TIME

"YESTERDAYS MISINFORMATION, TODAY'S FACT" or yesterday's correct information,
todays falsity.

THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNING EXAMPLE OF AUSTRALIANS BARRY MARSHALL AND ROBIN
WARREN      - Nobel Prize Winners in 2005 in Physiology and Medicine.

Today's misinformation regularly becomes tomorrow's fact. This is highly true of
developments in science and technology.

A classic example of such is the well known incident of when an Australian
gastroenterologist announced at a 1982 medical conference of his peers, that most
stomach and peptic ulcers "were caused by a bacterium". This then novel revelation was
met with ridicule bordering on contempt and even with threats against the doctor's
continued practise of his profession.

The Sydney based gastroenterologist presented research conducted by the
aforementioned Australian researchers Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, indicating that
stomach and peptic ulcers were largely as a result of the _bacterium_ _heliobacter_ _pylori._

In the current environment, where a competing or novel view is commonly regarded as
misinformation/disinformation. When this announcement as to the genesis of stomach
ulceration was made, it was regarded as shockingly wrong and inerrant, and thus in the
modern vernacular,would be categorised as DISINFORMATION of the highest order.

The only problem with that prevailing view       - the then knowledge       - the narrative       - the
consensus       - the SCIENCE regarding stomach ulcers, was that THE PREVAILING VIEW, THE
KNOWLEDGE , THE NARATIVE, THE CONSENSUS, THE SCIENCE —- WAS ALL WRONG !!!!!
But those that held that view did not initially accept the new research and were highly
sceptical and resistant. It went against medical schooling, and the accepted peer reviewed
knowledge.

As a matter of logic the fact that the novel idea wasn't then accepted _did_ _not_ _make_ _it_
_wrong_ _-_ _it_ _was_ _new_ _competing_ _information,_ _now_ _competing_ _against_ _consensus_ _opposing_
_information_ that stomach and peptic ulcers were the result of stress.

In the brave new world of "misinformation determinations" there is an _inherent_ _tendency_
_to_ _accept_ _the_ _truth_ _of_ _a_ _proposition_ _simply_ _because_ _it_ _is_ _the_ _prevailing_ _view_ or the
consensus. Truth cannot be equated with consensus.

As indicated elsewhere, it is the competition of ideas in the public square that ultimately
gives a society the best chance of determining where truth lies. The bill restricts the ability
to publish competing views and non consensus views. It will fully restrict the flow of
information, knowledge and opinion, especially new knowledge and is thus anti- thetical
to the human spirit and desire.

Returning to the example Warren and Marshall who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005
some 23 years after their initial research.

I now quote directly from a published article in the ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AND ANTIMICROBIALS titled “ 23 Years of the discovery of Heliobacter pylori; is the debate
over" by Niyaz Ahmed
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283743/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1283743/)

### “Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren, two Australian researchers who discovered the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and deciphered its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, have been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute has honored them for their unexpected but paradigm shift discovery [f£] that revealed that gastritis, and ulceration ofthe stomach or duodenum, were the result of infection with some curved Gram negative bacilli.

 At that time when Warren and Marshall announced their findings, it was a long-standing belief in medical teaching and practice that stress and lifestyle factors were the major causes
## of peptic ulcer disease. Warren and Marshall rebutted that dogma, and it was soon clear that
### H. pylori, causes more than 90% of duodenal ulcers and up to 80% of gastric ulcers. The clinical community, however, met theirfindings, with skepticism and a lot ofcriticism and that's why it took quite a remarkable length of time for their discovery to become widely accepted.

From the published article we see that the researchers were met with "skepticsim and a
lot of criticism". The discovery was an "unexpected but paradigm shift discovery".

The vast majority of medical authorities of the day and for quite some time thereafter did
not believe the research and deemed the research wrong, incorrect, not properly based
and effectively as DISINFORMATION.

Fast forward to today, and It is now accepted that H.PYLORI causes 90% of duodenal ulcers
and up to 80% of gastric ulcers.

What can we learn from this? _It_ _is_ _clear_ _that_ _if_ _this_ _style_ _of_ _opinion/_ _research_ _was_
_published_ _today_ _by_ _Warren_ _and_ _Marshall_ _it_ _would_ _be_ _deemed_ _as_ _dangerous_
_misinformation_ _or_ _disinformation._ Why -because it simply went against the prevailing
knowledge.

What this classic example teaches us is _that_ _knowledge_ _evolves_ _and_ _what_ _has_ _previously_
_been_ _known_ _or_ _is_ _known_ _today_ _may_ _in_ _fact_ _be_ _wrong_ and actually be the true
misinformation or disinformation. The free flow of ideas and information must be
maintained at all cost if knowledge is to develop and evolve. This is the minimum that we
would expect of each other if we are truly to accept our fellow human being as being an
equal person and having inalienable rights.


-----

If conversely we think that a government authority has the right to determine
misinformation or disinformation or correct information, what then does it say about us as

a society?
Have we lost that much respect for our fellow man that we do not trust there honestly
held views opinions, knowledge or research, that we no longer are prepared to give our
fellow human being equal time and equal rights and the ability to express those ideas?

The proposed bill although argueably well meaning, is philosophically and fundamentally
flawed at its core and represents the most atrocious attack on human liberty, free speech
and the human spirit.
The amount of lives that have been saved and the reduced suffering brought about by the
above research, is testament to the free exchange of ideas.

Had the prevailing view of the then experts been maintained, science would not have
advanced, human suffering in this instance would not have been alleviated, and the
earnest and honest endeavours of two brilliant men never come to light

However the bill under consideration effectively bestows upon the ACMA the power to
determine what is information and what is truth on all matters. In the above example
those putting forward the views of Warren and Marshall would have been viewed as
purveyors of disinformation as in fact occurred. The ACMA would have done likewise.

At any one time there are almost infinite competing views on subjects, or alternate views
on matters, and new knowledge and evolving information, novel and confronting ideas
and information, ideas and research that challenge consensus or accepted narratives or
orthodoxies.
Are we now so intellectually fragile that we need to determine, that which confronts or
challenges prevailing orthodoxy, as being misinformation or disinformation? That is not
the history of western liberalism nor enlightenment. The attitude should be to test and
challenge everything, and let competing knowledge and opinions actually compete in the
public square, and rise or fall upon their respective merits, and then and only then can we
move towards truth and what is beneficial.

There are in place appropriate laws in Criminal Codes and pursuant to defamation laws to
restrict criminally inciteful speech or civilly defamatory speech.

There is no need for an entity that would literally become the rightly feared Orwellian
MINISTRY OF TRUTH to determine right speech from wrong speech       - what is true and
what is not. The concept is ultimately abhorrent.
