For a democracy to function, the people need to be able to discuss ideas, to disseminate information
which may be incorrect so that others may have the opportunity to educate them, or be educated in
alternative viewpoints, to get a better understanding of the situation. To eliminate “misinformation”
is to eliminate discussion. Information which is intended to mislead and cause harm, i.e.
“disinformation” already falls under the concept of fraud.

As is already covered in the criminal code act of 1995, anybody who does anything with the
intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person is guilty of an offence. Under the proposed
amendments, somebody who deceives others to cause harm is guilty of an offence. This is
unnecessary, as the criminal code already covers this. There is also no reason whatsoever to make
anybody exempt from such criminal behaviour, including government agencies and approved media
outlets.

The term loss, used in the criminal code is also far more exact and quantifiable than harm to the
economy, environment, etc.

My country of birth developed methods for dealing with mis/disinformation in the 1930’s. The final
solution to eliminating mis/disinformation is to send offenders to rehabilitation camps…

Lest we forget.
