This proposed ‘combatting misinformation and disinformation bill’ would violate Australian’s
constitutional right to freedom of speech. It must be stopped immediately.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), does not have the right to
decide what constitutes the truth. The health department misled the public when they reported a
high number of patients in hospital with COVID, only to amend this figure some months later by
omitting patients who were admitted to hospital with conditions or injuries other than COVID. This
was a much smaller number; making the initial ‘truth’ an untruth.

One person’s ‘truth’ is radically different to another person’s truth when it comes to religion. Does
the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), propose censoring the speech of
any religions they themselves deem to be ‘untrue’?

‘The truth’ is always multi-faceted depending on one’s perspective so it should never be narrowed to
one source. Also, ‘the truth’ can change over time as new information comes to light. Is the world
round or is it flat? That seems to depend on which century you were born. I wonder what ‘the truth’
will be next century!

# I reiterate: this bill must be thrown on the scrape heap where it belongs.
