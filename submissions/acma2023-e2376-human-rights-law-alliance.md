## Human Rights Law Alliance Submission on the exposure

# draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment

## (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

##### Summary

1. HRLA is opposed to the Bill in its entirety, for the following reasons:

1.1. The Bill establishes a framework for excessive interference with free expression. This Bill

is contrary to Australia's commitments under Article 19 of the International Covenant

on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

1.2. The Bill includes overly broad and amorphous definitions of "harm" and
"misinformation"/"disinformation" and sets a low bar for interference with free speech

and which presents a real risk that the law will be misused to engage in ideological and

political censorship.

1.3. The Bill provides the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA), with

extreme powers to censor speech that are not amenable to proper oversight and

review.

1.4. The Bill fails to provide any balancing provisions that would penalise overzealous

policing of speech or which would be capable of protecting the free speech of

Australians (such as an information Ombudsman).

1.5. The Bill imposes the threat of draconian penalties on social media providers which is

likely to result in the "voluntary" adoption of an overly restrictive code that will

threaten free speech.

1.6. The Bill is asymmetrical in its application and exempts government communications

making one rule for the public and another rule for government; and

1.7. The Bill is excessive compared to similar overseas measures.

2. The Bill would be effective in securing the Government's wish to authorise the imposition of

severe restrictions on the free speech of digital platform users. It would deliver to the

Government the power which it seeks, but in doing so makes no provision for freedom of

expression. This Bill should be rejected.

##### Detailed Submissions

The Bill unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech

3. The Bill mentions freedom of expression once, in amendments that it would make to the

Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (by adding a new section. 4(3AC)) to state that Parliament

"intends that digital platform services be regulated, in order to prevent and respond to

1

misinformation and disinformation on the services, in a manner that: (a) has regard to

freedom of expression" etc. The official Guidance Note also suggest that freedom of

expression will be supported. I will not be.

4. Since freedom of expression does not exist in Australia, though lesser forms of protection do,
it is misleading of the Government to maintain that it does, both in the Bill and the official

Guidance Note. Whatever protection for free speech exists in Australia is a poor subset of

"freedom of expression", and does not even go by the name "freedom of expression".

5. HRLA considers that the Government is not being frank with the Australian public in

presenting this Bill. It includes narrow exceptions for matters such as news content, parody,

satire and education, most of which should not in principle even qualify as disinformation, and
it preserves the freedom of political communication under the Constitution (to save the Bill

from invalidity). It makes no allowance for protection equivalent to "freedom of expression",

which is understood in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights article 10, and the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) article 19.

6. HRLA is especially concerned at the limited public consultation on this proposal, already at the

stage of an exposure draft, when an issue of such profound social importance deserves

greater opportunity for stakeholder engagement and consideration.

The Bill bears no relation to comparable measures overseas

7. There are some obvious parallels between certain provisions of the Bill and European Union

measures addressing misinformation, such as the European Commission's _Communication_ _on_

_the_ _European_ _Democracy_ _Action_ _Plan,_ and the _EU_ _Strengthened_ _Code_ _of_ _Practice_ _on_

_Disinformation_ _2022._ However, there is a crucial difference. All EU measures uphold and

maintain protection for freedom of expression, as understood under article 10 of the

European Convention.

8. The equivalent to article 10 of the European Convention is article 19 of the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Australia is bound to implement but has

failed to do so. If it had done, the freedom would support access to, and expression of,
information by Australians (including on digital platforms).

9. The Bill fails to offer any comparable protection for freedom of expression, and for so long as

Australian law does not protect that freedom it is wrong to suggest that it does.

10. The Bill is therefore misleading, in proposing the insertion of a new s.4(3AC) of the

_Broadcasting_ _Services_ _Act_ _1992,_ that "The Parliament also intends that digital platform

services be regulated, in order to prevent and respond to misinformation and disinformation

on the services, in a manner that: (a) has regard to freedom of expression", since there is no

human rights protection of the individual equivalent in coverage to freedom of expression.

The Bill has no balancing clauses

11. The Guidance Note explaining the provisions of the Bill is even more misleading, in repeating
the pretence that the Bill is capable of supporting freedom of expression, when stating:

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


-----

11.1. on p.6, "We seek your views on the exposure draft (ED) Bill and whether the proposed

legislation strikes an appropriate balance of a range of issues such as freedom of

expression"

11.2. on p.7, "In balancing freedom of expression with the need to address online harm, the

code and standard-making powers will not apply to professional news and authorised

electoral content, nor will the ACMA have a role in determining what is considered
###### truthful", and

11.3. on p.12, "The Bill excludes certain content from the definition of misinformation to

strike a balance between the public interest in combatting misinformation, with the

right to freedom of expression.

12. To comply with article 19:

12.1. Restrictions on freedom of expression have to be justified as "necessary" for a

legitimate purpose.

12.2. Restrictions must not be overbroad. They must be the least intrusive means to achieve

their protective function; they must be proportionate to the interest to be protected,

both in the law that frames the restrictions but also by the administrative and judicial

authorities in applying the law.

12.3. The government must demonstrate in specific and individualised fashion the precise

nature of the threat, and the necessity and proportionality of the specific action taken,

in particular by establishing a direct and immediate connection between the expression

and the threat.

13. This Bill does nothing to secure freedom of expression, and is therefore defective in

fundamental ways that comparable measures in the EU are not.

The Government should have taken notice of the following clear guidance from the UN SecretaryÂ­
General

14. In August 2022 the UN Secretary General provided clear guidance on countering

disinformation in a way that meets the ICCPR's requirements for upholding freedom of

expression under article 19. This is the relevant standard since the ICCPR is binding on

Australia.

14.1. "State responses to disinformation must themselves avoid infringing on rights, including
the right to freedom of opinion and expression."

14.2. "responses to the spread of disinformation should comply with international human

rights law and promote, protect and respect the right of individuals to freedom of

expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information."

14.3. "State efforts to address the impacts of disinformation should avoid approaches that

impose an undue burden on the freedom of expression or are susceptible to politicized

implementation. Not all inaccurate information is harmful, and only some harms              - such

as those that in fact implicate public health, electoral processes or national security               -

may warrant State intervention. Even when there is a legitimate public interest

purpose, the risks inherent in the regulation of expression require a carefully tailored

approach that complies with the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality

under human rights law."

14.4. "States bear the primary responsibility to counter disinformation by respecting,

protecting and fulfilling the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, to privacy and
to public participation."

14.5. "To be effective in countering disinformation, responses need to be multifaceted and

context-specific, and should be grounded in respect for the right to freedom of

expression."

14.6. The Secretary-General recommended that States:

14.7. "Recognize that a multifaceted approach anchored in the protection of and respect for

human rights, in particular the right to freedom of expression, is indispensable for

combating disinformation."

14.8. "Invest in meaningful, inclusive and safe participation at all levels, from local to global,

and respect the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, to association and to

peaceful assembly, in recognition of the role of community engagement and civil

society involvement in enhancing societies' resilience to polarization."

14.9. "States should adhere to international human rights principles when countering

disinformation and ensure that any restrictions on the right to freedom of expression

are provided for by law, serve a recognized legitimate interest, and are necessary and

proportionate to protect that interest."1

15. The Bill fails to observe any of these serious appeals to freedom of expression. Instead, the Bill

gives ACM A the power to interfere unjustifiably with the freedom of expression of Australians

on a larger scale than has ever occurred before.

The Bill contains overly broad definitions that invite abuse

16. The code that ultimately applies is not settled. It will regulate two types of online information,

misinformation and disinformation. A differentiating feature between them is whether there

is an intention to cause harm:

16.1. 'Misinformation' is content that is considered false, misleading or deceptive, which

regardless of intention is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

rights and fundamental freedoms, A/77/287,12 August 2022, paras 10,11, 42, 56, 57, 60.

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


-----

16.2. 'Disinformation' is a subset of misinformation, that is disseminated deliberately or with

an intent to deceive or cause serious harm.

17. The Bill is predicated on a broad conception of "harm".

18. Legislative responses to supposed "harm" in Australia are already highly politicised. The Bill

would polarise and fracture Australian society at a time when it needs healing.

18.1. "Harm" includes "hatred...on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual

orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability". "Hatred" lacks any objective

meaning. The simple expression of difference of opinion is becoming synonymous with

hatred.

18.2. "Harm to the health of Australians" could foreseeably prevent open discussion, for

example, on gender transitioning, and the "affirmation-only" model which is

increasingly open to question in light of available science in the findings of the Cass

inquiry in the UK.

18.3. Since authorised government material is immune from constituting "misinformation",

any online public debate criticising or challenging a position taken by any Australian

government (whether Commonwealth, state or territory), or government official such

as the chief medical officer, is liable to censorship. It is undemocratic to impose a

government view in place of public debate on sensitive subjects concerning the

wellbeing of Australians. They are entitled to the best available health treatment most
fitting to their circumstances. It amounts to the substitution of ideology for caring

medical practice.

18.4. Public discussion questioning conversion therapy legislation is often described as

hateful, even though it unjustifiably prohibits prayer, talk-based counselling and other

help. Discussion could similarly be shut down, on the basis that positions put in public

debate contradict a government-endorsed ideological position. This would be an

extremely serious curtailment of freedom of expression, which has no justification.

The Bill imposes overly draconian penalties

19. The Bill stipulates hefty penalties for breaches:

19.1. of the industry code of practice, of up to $2.75 million or 2% of their global turnover

19.2. of any ACMA-imposed standard, of up to $6.88 million or 5% of global turnover.

20. This will cause digital platforms to monitor and exclude content excessively, as a self-

protective measure to avoid significant fines. This will necessarily have a stifling effect on free

speech and access to information in Australia.

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


-----

The Bill places too much power in ACMA

21. This Bill essentially gives the government, through ACMA, a mechanism to determine what
constitutes acceptable content, on an unprecedented scale. It gives the state power beyond

anything that a government should have in a free and democratic society. There is insufficient

oversight of ACMA to ensure that ACMA itself does not inappropriately implement the

legislation to encourage the mislabelling of content as misinformation, or to accentuate or

amplify misinformation.

##### Conclusion

22. The Bill is far more extensive than any form of regulation of digital content that exists in

Australia already. It covers all content. Freedom of expression is not preserved at all by the

Bill.

23. The Bill will result in liability on the part of digital platforms related to their turnover, running

in billions of dollars, and will cause them to censor out of self-interest.

24. The everyday usage of digital platforms by Australians will be restricted, when Australians are
entitled to express themselves and access what others have to say. It is fundamental to

maintaining democratic accountability. The Bill is excessive in controlling online content. It has

the potential for misuse by substituting government ideology for public debate.

25. We are grateful for the opportunity to make this submission and welcome any opportunity to

appear in support of it.

Yours sincerely,

John Steenhof
