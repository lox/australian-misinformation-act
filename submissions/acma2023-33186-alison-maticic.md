# Feedback on the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The definition of misinformation (Exposure Draft page 12 line 4 - 14) poses a dilemma from
the outset. There is no guarantee that what is deemed misinformation today won’t be
proven correct in the future. A government body cannot determine this and should not be
given any kind of power to limit the expression or discussion of alternate viewpoints. This
risks the advancement and development of new ideas and learning.

Alternate viewpoints (which some would call misinformation) should be allowed to come
from all areas of society and not be limited to entertainment, news providers, education
institutions, and government which are the only entities defined as being excluded from
misinformation content (page 5 from line 11).

Harm (page 6 lines 7 - 18) is defined as a number of things that are particularly concerning in
a democratic society. Peaceful protests including union actions have the potential to be
considered a disruption to public order or society. Under the proposed bill, using a digital
platform to communicate about activities such as these would be considered harm if the
premise of them was seen to be based on misinformation. Australian society prides itself on
the right to protest and should continue to be able to do so in a digital society where
communication about such actions is done using a digital service.

Another point in the definition of harm relates to the word ‘hatred’. This is a word that is
commonly misunderstood, and to say something that a person of a particular group may
find offensive could easily be considered as hatred towards that group. All the groups listed
in the definition of harm (p6 lines 8 - 10) have the potential to see themselves as
experiencing hatred when certain viewpoints are shared, whether or not hatred is intended.

My concern with this proposed bill is primarily based on the definitions of misinformation
and harm. I believe that it has the power to stifle free speech and the expression of
alternate world views. In the times in which we live, digital communication platforms are
the number one way of expressing ideas. To impose such laws on what can be shared via
these platforms would have the potential to limit our diverse and democratic country to a
narrow, ‘government approved’ ideology.
