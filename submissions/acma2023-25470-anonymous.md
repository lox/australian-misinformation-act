Combatting Misinformation/Disinformation Bill

Thankyou for your consideration of my submission-funnily enough it could be the last time I a free in
this country to freely express my responses to a proposed government bill,without fear of harm or
penalty to myself for disagreeing with the Governments views or decisions, my views deleted by
social media for fear of the penalties to themselves-Is this then a democratic bill or a dictatorship
bill?

Whether I choose to source my information from ABC or SKY NEWS,or anything inbetween,I
currently have a choice to listen to, hear,different versions of "The Truth" about politics or any other
issues.

This bill threatens freedom of information and therefore critical thinking,it supresses debate from
kindergarten to university, to old age.It is a harmful/hurtful and a hating bill-it hates freedom of
thought,speech,expression,truth and debate

It is unsound-the government/ACMI itself is not accountable, only every other Australian
person,corporation,business.

How can a "independent regulator" be independent,when it is chosen by the government of the
day,and isnt a cross-section of different community values,beliefs,life-styles?

A bill that doesn't allow for debate,dissent,or differences in understanding of "truth" is dangerous to
humanity.

History shows when governments take over more and more power from the individual human
rights,inevitably its a downhill slide to dictatorship governments,which does not make a safer
australia for all,and is not for the good of all individuals.

There can't be safeguards for a bill such as this,because any safeguards implemented get eroded
over time

"Truth" perceived by government or the ACMA is not reality. It is only the latest version of it.

Speech that is monitored and censored and then if 'perceived' to be 'hateful or harmful',punishes
severely is a frightening thing

Please stop this bill

Please protect our democracy

Please allow every Australian to be live freely in peace from this threat of dictatorship

Thankyou
