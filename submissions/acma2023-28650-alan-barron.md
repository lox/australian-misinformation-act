**Submission regarding to proposed ACMA powers**

Family Voice believes that in a democracy. freedom of expression is vital. . What is
deeply disturbing is that while the citizens of Australia will be subject to this
proposed Ministry of Truth Bill to censor out `misinformation', yet the government
and government agencies will be exempt from `misinformation’ purges. What
arrogance! Why should the government be exempt from being vetoed on
misinformation?

The government proposed `disinformation and information Bill is a nonsense. If all
Australians are to be under these `misinformation' laws, then that has to include all
levels of government and their agencies. As history tells us, governments have been
caught out many times mishandling the true, and if they aren't prepared to do that
then they have no right to bring in these `misinformation' laws in which will be used
as a blunt instrument to curb free speech and democracy in this country.

It seems to us, based on our experiences, that when unelected bureaucrats,
whether they be in government, semi-government bodies, or the private sphere, tend
to filter out opinions that do not agree with the official line being put forward by a
particular platform or by the government. This was demonstrated during the Covid
pandemic where Facebook, Youtube and others blocked messages which did not
support the consensus view or the official government stance on covid.

Even comments made by highly credentialed professionals, who deviated from the
party line were labelled “misinformation.” This also happened to a lesser degree on
discussions regarding climate change.

So the less government and/or bureaucratic supervision of opinion published on
social media the better.

In a multi-cultural society freedom of expression should be welcomed and insidious
measure introduced to allegedly protect the public interest must be taken with a grain
of salt. Policies which are designed to impede or marginalise dissenting voices must
not be allowed to stifle debate and open discussion.

If an individual expresses a view on social media which is not well researched,
incorrect, hateful, or just plain wrong, other citizens will soon address this - and that's
how freedom of expression should work in an open forum in a genuine democracy.

The Disinformation Bill 2023 which is to be administered by ACMA while well
intended and sounding well and good in theory, but may not prove to be so workable
in practice as a small group of bureaucrats gets to determine what is acceptable and
what is not.

In any event, it sets a very dangerous precedent. Who gets to decide what is `truth’
and what is `false’? Is an ACMA official, or panels of bureaucrats –and who
determines who is qualified to make these types of assessments on a wide range of
topics?

Democracy can only work when citizens have genuine freedom of expression to
dissimulate their views. Democracy is a fragile thing and moves to censor a person’s
right to free speech must be preserved at all costs. Giving a bureaucratic body like
the ACMA to filter out what it regards as error, is the thin edge of the wedge.

It seems giving a body like the ACMA wide ranging powers seems like letting the
government telling its citizens what to think, this seems to be implied in the proposed
Bill. Marginalising alternative points of view which purportedly go against the
perceived best interests of the public may in fact have the opposite effect.

A person would expect such a bill as the `Disinformation Bill 2023’ to be
implemented by an authoritarian regime as found in Hong Kong. Of course these
types of laws usually are bought in under the guise of protecting the public interest,
but the reality is that such laws have the opposite effect.
In modern day pluralistic Australia, such laws don’t belong in an open and genuine
free society.
