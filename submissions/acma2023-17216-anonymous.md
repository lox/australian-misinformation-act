# The Perilous Path to Truth: An Authority as the Arbiter of Truth?

By:

## Executive Summary

The quest for truth requires careful consideration of the limitations and complexities surrounding
its determination. Placing exclusive authority in the hands of a single government-appointed
body to define truth is fraught with challenges.
Truth is subjective and influenced by subjectivity, diverse perspectives, cultural beliefs and
historical contexts, making it impossible for any single authority to claim comprehensive
knowledge.

Moreover, relying solely on a group of appointed experts comes with the inherent biases and
conflicts of interest they may possess. Groupthink, political pressure, and limitations of
knowledge further complicates the situation.

Establishing an single authority of the truth goes against democratic principles. It concentrates
power and decision-making in the hands of a select few, limiting the autonomy and agency of
individuals within a society. Such an arrangement can undermine the diversity of opinions and
reverse the progress of democratic societies.

In a democracy, the pursuit of truth is a noble and worthwhile endeavour that inherently lies
within the domain of individuals. Government involvement in determining truth is unnecessary
and problematic. Instead, governments can play a valuable role by allocating resources and
fostering an environment that promotes critical thinking skills among the populace.

## Introduction

The proposal to confer powers upon a government-appointed regulatory authority to address
misinformation and disinformation raises substantial concerns. It necessitates a critical inquiry:
Can such an authority truly possess independence and impartiality? Moreover, given the
subjective, intricate, and nuanced nature of truth, can this authority effectively discern it?


-----

## Discussion

**Deciphering truth is an intricate and philosophical endeavour. Truth is influenced by**
subjectivity, diverse perspectives, cultural beliefs, and historical contexts. These factors
contribute to the multiplicity and intricacy of truth, making it impractical for a single authority to
claim complete authority over its determination.

The subjective nature of truth necessitates a recognition of the diverse interpretations and
understandings that arise from different individuals and groups. It involves discerning
statements or beliefs that align objectively with reality, devoid of personal perspectives or
biases. Consequently, entrusting a single "supreme arbiter" with the authority to dictate truth
raises profound concerns and formidable challenges.

**Subjectivity exerts an enormous influence on truth, as personal and group biases, cultural**
beliefs, scientific paradigms, political ideologies, and limited perspectives shape interpretations
and understandings of reality. This subjectivity spawns divergent notions of truth. Relying solely
on an individual or government-appointed authority as the ultimate determinant of truth
becomes deeply problematic due to the inherent subjectivity of human judgement.

**Inherent biases and values affect both individuals and authorities, rendering them fallible and**
susceptible to errors in perception, judgement, and reasoning. Even those with the noblest
intentions can err, harbour false beliefs, or succumb to cognitive biases. Claiming infallibility in
ascertaining truth presents an insurmountable challenge for any person or group.

**Conflicts of Interests. An authority, even one made up of experts, faces tremendous hurdles in**
terms of impartiality due the inevitable conflicts of interests common among experts. These
conflicts of interest are an intrinsic part of human nature and professional environments, and
can compromise an experts' impartiality and objectivity. Financial interests, professional
affiliations, institutional priorities, personal beliefs, career ambitions, reputation concerns, and
political or ideological pressures can all undermine the fairness of experts' judgments.

Efforts towards transparency, disclosure, and conflict management often fall short since the
presence of conflicts of interest or political pressure within an authority makes it impossible to
completely eliminate biases. Therefore it is impossible and disingenuous to rely on a single
body of experts to determine what is truth.

**Groupthink and manipulation pose grave threats to the pursuit of truth. Groupthink stifles**
diversity and critical thinking, leading to a biased and narrow-minded approach that dismisses
alternative viewpoints. It reinforces confirmation bias, selectively accepting information that
aligns with a government or corporate interest's agenda while disregarding contradictory
evidence.


-----

**Manipulation of data and propaganda can shape public opinion, suppress dissent, distort**
information, and create false consensus. Lack of accountability and transparency in
decision-making processes can result in bias, manipulation, and abuse of authority.
These issues undermine the principles of diversity, critical thinking, and open discourse
essential for an objective understanding of truth. Relying on a single authority as the sole arbiter
of truth erodes trust in the information provided and restricts the public's ability to critically
evaluate different perspectives.

**Experts and commoners. Restricting the determination of truth, misinformation, and**
disinformation exclusively to experts or individuals with specialised knowledge is both elitist and
dangerous. This viewpoint is supported by several key arguments.

  - It is exclusionary and perpetuates elitism by suggesting that only those with specific
credentials or specialised knowledge can discern truth. This undermines the democratic
principle of accessible knowledge for all.

  - Relying solely on experts disregards the fact that truth emerges from diverse
perspectives and experiences, leading to a limited understanding of complex issues.

  - Concentrating truth determination in the hands of a select group of selected and
government approved experts opens the door to biases, manipulation, and the
suppression of dissenting views.

  - Only giving value to expert opinion undermines individual autonomy and critical thinking
by implying that individuals cannot evaluate information or make decisions for
themselves.

  - An exclusive reliance on experts can stifle innovation and impede progress by inhibiting
new perspectives and fresh ideas. A more democratic and inclusive approach involves
embracing diverse viewpoints, promoting critical thinking, and recognising truth as a
collective endeavour involving all members of society.

**Limitations of knowledge further complicates the pursuit of truth. Our understanding of the**
world is continuously evolving, with new information challenging or refining existing notions of
truth. No individual or expert possesses unlimited knowledge, making it impossible for any
person or group to claim comprehensive expertise across all fields. Relying solely on a select
group as the ultimate arbiters of truth disregards valuable perspectives and insights.

**Collaboration and scrutiny. Truth often emerges through collaborative efforts involving**
multiple individuals contributing their expertise, evidence critical analysis and informed opinions.
Advancing our understanding of truth requires collective collaboration, fresh perspectives,
rigorous scrutiny, and open discourse.


-----

**Critical Thinking Skills. In a democracy, individuals are trusted to explore and evaluate**
information, drawing conclusions based on their own discernment. Government intervention in
this process introduces biases, limitations, and conflicts of interest that hinder the genuine
pursuit of truth.

Rather than exerting control over truth, governments can better serve society by investing in
education and creating opportunities for individuals to develop critical thinking abilities. In doing
so, governments can empower citizens to engage in informed discussions, make sound
judgments, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding. By focusing on
cultivating critical thinking skills within the Australian population, government can create an
environment conducive to truth-seeking and promote intellectual growth on a broader scale.

## Historical Parallels

The notion of entrusting a government appointed regulatory body as a designated arbitrator of
the "truth" is not only fundamentally flawed but also gravely perilous. History, along with
present-day examples, unequivocally reveals the dire consequences of such an approach.
When we examine the despotic regimes of Hitler's Nazi Germany, the CCP-controlled China,
and South Africa under Apartheid, the parallels become stark, illuminating the severe perils that
arise when a government claims the authority to dictate what is true and false through the
establishment of a Ministry of Truth or similar entities to control the flow of information
accessible to its citizens.

Hitler's Nazi ("National Socialist German Workers' Party") regime serves as a chilling reminder
of the dangers inherent in such a system. Hitler skillfully manipulated and controlled the press in
Germany to advance his malicious agenda. Through carefully crafted legislation, Hitler sought to
silence opposition and establish total control over the media. Hitler's imposed stringent
regulations on the journalism profession through the Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Press
Chamber. They exercised control over who could enter the field, excluding Jews and individuals
married to Jews. Journalists and editors were compelled to adhere to the ministry's directives
and guidelines, facing imprisonment in concentration camps if their work was deemed
detrimental to Germany. The Nazi propaganda apparatus sought to assert dominance over the
dissemination and interpretation of news while denying access to alternative sources of
information.

Similarly, during the era of Apartheid in South Africa, the government utilised strict censorship
measures and information control to perpetuate its discriminatory regime. The Publications
Control Board, established under the Publications Act of 1974, wielded significant power in
determining which information could be disseminated to the public. Publications critical of the
government's policies or supportive of racial equality were systematically banned or censored.
The government aimed to shape public perception, control the narrative, and suppress
opposition to its discriminatory practices.

## Contemporary Parallels

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exhibits a similar modus operandi in the present day.
Under the CCP's rule, the dissemination of information is tightly controlled through an extensive
censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. External sources of information are severely
restricted, and domestic media outlets are tightly regulated. The CCP's Ministry of Truth-like
organisations, such as the State Council Information Office and the Cyberspace Administration
of China, manipulate and suppress information to align with the government's narrative and
maintain its iron grip on power.

In China, the government actively propagates state-sanctioned "truth" while ruthlessly
suppressing dissenting voices and alternative viewpoints. Internet surveillance, content filtering,
and severe penalties for individuals who challenge the official narrative are commonplace. The
result is a highly controlled information ecosystem that stifles freedom of expression, impairs
critical thinking, and restricts access to accurate and diverse information. The CCP's relentless
efforts to assert control over the truth have spawned a climate of fear, self-censorship, and the
erosion of civil liberties.

In conclusion, the historical examples of Hitler's censoring of the press and propaganda
campaigns, coupled with the contemporary cases of CCP-controlled China and South Africa
under Apartheid, provide compelling evidence of the dangers and futility of entrusting a
government with a designated arbitrator of the truth. The suppression of dissent, manipulation of
information, and erosion of civil liberties that accompany such control undermine the
foundations of a free and democratic society. It is imperative that we uphold the principles of
freedom of expression, diversity of information sources, and critical thinking to ensure that the
truth remains a dynamic and multifaceted concept open to interpretation and debate by
individuals within a society. Only by safeguarding these principles can we preserve the integrity
of information and protect ourselves from the perils of unchecked power and the erosion of civil
liberties.

## ACMA with Expanded Powers

The proposal to grant the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) expanded
powers to combat online misinformation and disinformation is a dangerous step towards
authoritarianism and poses a severe threat to democracy. Disguised as protecting the safety
and well-being of Australians, this move sets a perilous precedent that can lead to increased
control and censorship of information, stifling freedom of speech, and undermining the principles
of an open and democratic society.

Granting the ACMA the authority to gather information from digital platform providers and
require them to maintain records infringes upon privacy rights and opens the door to potential
abuses of power. Unchecked surveillance capabilities can create a chilling effect on freedom of
expression, as individuals may fear being monitored or punished for expressing dissenting
opinions or sharing alternative viewpoints.

Furthermore, the proposal to have the ACMA request the industry to develop a code of practice
and potentially enforce it as an industry standard is deeply concerning. This effectively
empowers a government-appointed body to dictate and regulate what can and cannot be
expressed on digital platforms, placing an undue burden on platforms and potentially leading to
self-censorship out of fear of regulatory consequences.

The ACMA's ability to enforce even stronger forms of regulation undermines the autonomy and
independence of digital platforms, potentially suppressing voices that challenge or criticise those
in power.

The claim that these measures balance freedom of speech is highly dubious. The proposal is
completely counter to fundamental rights and democratic principles. The proposed powers of
the ACMA grant it significant control over information flow, creating an environment prone to
abuse, manipulation, and the suppression of dissenting voices.

## Conclusion

The pursuit of truth is a complex and nuanced endeavour that cannot be effectively achieved by
relying solely on a single government-appointed authority. Truth is subjective and influenced by
diverse perspectives, cultural beliefs, and historical contexts, making it impossible for any single
entity to claim comprehensive knowledge or objectivity. The inherent biases and conflicts of
interest present among experts, coupled with the risks of groupthink, manipulation, and
limitations of knowledge, further complicate the determination of truth.

Restricting the determination of truth to a select group or exclusive authority is not only elitist but
also undermines individual autonomy, critical thinking, and innovation. It stifles diverse
perspectives and hampers progress by disregarding valuable insights from various members of
society. Collaborative efforts, rigorous scrutiny, and open discourse are essential for advancing
our understanding of truth.

These examples of Hitler's Nazi Germany, CCP-controlled China, and Apartheid-era South
Africa underscore the inherent dangers of entrusting a designated arbitrator of the truth to a
government. When a government assumes the authority to dictate what is true and false, it
invariably leads to the suppression of dissent, distortion of information, and erosion of
fundamental freedoms.

The proposal to grant expanded powers to a government-appointed authority, such as the
ACMA, to combat misinformation and disinformation, raises significant concerns. The proposed
measures infringe upon privacy rights and unduly restrict freedom of expression. Granting
excessive control and censorship powers to an authority risks undermining democratic
principles and suppressing dissenting voices.

Rationally, it is clear that relying solely on a single authority as the arbiter of truth is impractical
and inadequate. A more nuanced and democratic approach involves embracing transparency.
By encouraging individual autonomy and promoting critical thinking skills, encouraging calm,
respectful and open debate, we can navigate the perilous path to truth and foster a society that
values and considers all points of view.
