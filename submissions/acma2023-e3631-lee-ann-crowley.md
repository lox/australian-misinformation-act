RE: **Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation) Bill 2023**

I disagree with the ‘proposed laws to hold digital platform services to account and create
_transparency around their in responding to misinformation and disinformation in Australia’._

Such changes in the law amendments propose a threat to the safety & wellbeing of Australians as
well as our democracy society & economy

My experience and view with social media platforms is that those policing members content block
and remove a member’s personal views, experience and scientific knowledge because it does not
meet their own limited knowledge, wisdom, experience, research and exploration of truths and
perhaps even the hidden agendas of social experiments and governments attempts to blindside
communities.

An example of this is I am currently blocked from Facebook since October 1, 2022 for sharing a new
singer’s album in a fan group that there are >5000 members in community of adoration for this
band’s music and the reason Facebook police state ‘is that it is Spam’. I have found it impossible to
get my original Facebook account reopened despite that I have stated I have been wrongly locked
out; that sharing new music of singer to the fan base is not ‘spam’ but sharing new music updates
within the band fanbase.

  - Another example is COVID19 information and vaccination personal views and scientific
views. I have an Applied Science degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, my
knowledge on these subjects is one does not go messing with one’s DNA by adding a mRNA
virus load into the human body :

1 – because one should not be messing with one’s DNA when it works perfectly well in the
decades of immunity responses that have fronted up in one’s current lifetime.

2 – viruses are known to be able to replicate themselves in a host cell with only a portion of
their machinery.

3 – it is known zinc inhibits viral replication and for three decades now whenever I have the
first signs of flu-like symptoms I take zinc supplements for a few days and generally avoid a
bout of sickness unlike my colleagues.

An excerpt from my eBook ‘Called To Stand’
The benefits of zinc preventing viral replication, Echinacea when ill to help fight off infection;
it increases the white cell count, the bodies immunity fighter cells. There is always a bottle of
Blackmore’s combined Zinc, Echinacea & ACE tablets in my fridge for this reason. As soon as
my body shares the first aches and pains of flu-like symptoms, I take a table day and night for
a few days to help shut down any possibility of flu-like illness. If one can picture an egg being
a virus capsule, hiding another fifty virus capsules within, like a Trojan horse; if I can block
one, then that is fifty less enemies attacking my body. This action appears to have blocked
the viral assault. When everyone else falls ill with the dreaded flu-like illnesses, I manage to
stay well. On the odd occasion where I have succumbed with the other employees, I tend to
carry the remnants of such illness for many less weeks than the other employees who came
down with the same symptoms.


-----

The human genome also consists of much junk DNA, during my degree I often thought the
possibility of junk DNA was from viral material that had accessed our complicated machinery
and been spat out and pushed aside.

A virus is an intracellular pathogen, it cannot replicate without utilizing the metabolism and
machinery of a host cell. Hence a virus must first invade a cell before viral replication can
occur. A virus will only multiply only in living cells & organism. A virus uses its host cell to
replicate its viral components using its mRNA. Viruses need entry into host cells to replicate
by usurping the host cells machinery. In short a virus is like a little robot that is able to use a
section of itself to raid a host cell and start making replications of itself.

In my eyes and knowledge inserting Viral mRNA is detrimental to my human DNA as the
vaccine is literally injecting COVID19 mRNA direct into a host cell to start the process of
replication within, the very thing one is trying to keep out of one’s body. I am not antivaccination, I prefer the trusted method of attenuated vaccines, not manipulation and
insertion of mRNA that has the computer codes and equipment (so to speak) to amend and
adjust one’s personal DNA linage.

My finely tuned body helps me understand many things about how I work and what keeps me well,
what aides me in overcoming sickness or avoiding it all together… u don’t know me like I know me.

I was sacked in Queensland for not being COVID19 vaccinated despite working two years frontline
during the pandemic without incident, because of a government’s ability to allow companies to do so
and the many scare factors and lack of understanding in comparison to the knowledge that I had
been equipped with during studies in my degree.

  - My experience with ‘freedom of speech and freedom of religion’ was called into question in
2007 when I experienced bullying by a group of ladies who claimed I was bullying them.

I experienced this long before footballer Israel Folau made his controversial comments that
had him on front pages of the media for long bouts of time and I had not even made such
comments or comparisons of comments as he was ostracized for stating. I was just being
myself in my inherent faith walk who got in and got the job done in my Qld Health laboratory
job. Often at times carrying the workload when the CSR dept other team members seem to
disappear for long bouts of time. Is it any wonder Qld health is experiencing the dramas that
are being reported time and time again.

An excerpt of this legal document is shared below and a larger slice of this legal document is
shared in my eBook ‘Called To Stand’.

Allegations of Bullying and Harassment &
Consideration for Possible Management Action

In response to the letter dated 5[th] April, 2011 in regards the above investigations.

I attended the interview as requested conducted by ‘The Private Investigator’ (name withheld)
on Wednesday 27[th] April, 2011. The interview was audio recorded during this event and ran from
9.08am till 11.22am.


-----

**It is alleged that you failed to meet your Code of Conduct responsibility to respect the**
**rights and views of your colleagues including their different values, beliefs and religion by**
**zealously espousing your own strong religious views in the workplace.**

I believe that is it my colleagues who are expressing their views and intolerances of me for who I
am. For it is said in the Shakespearean play ‘The Merchant of Venice’ – “You may have your
pound of flesh but not one drop of blood with it.” In a similar comparison, this is as it is with me.
One cannot separate spirit from soul from flesh and be truly who they are meant to be. I live and
breathe my faith daily. That’s who I am.

It is impossible to separate the God Factor in my life. I am a living, breathing, walking everyday
example of the Lords living word working within me. My personal relationship with the God-the
Heavenly Father, His son Jesus Christ – the Living Lord and the gift of the Holy Spirit has been
one that I have grown with since a small child. It is the very part of me that helps me to stand
through the tough times. It is who I go to when I am sad, when I have a question, when I want
intervention, when I want prayer and supplication for another. To the point I generally always
sought God for an answer before even considering putting a question to my parents. It is the very
part of me that I have consistently called and communicated upon for as long as I can remember.
God the Heavenly Father, the Father of Adam & Abraham & Isaac, who loves me and all that
belong to Him, that gave us His son Jesus Christ so that we would find a way back home to Him in
eternal life, with the gift of the Holy spirit given to us at the time of Jesus death for those who are
baptised in His name and seek Him, that leads us to all truth. As Jesus said, “I am the way, the
truth and the life.” I was always a child who sought the truth, and the Holy Spirit brings me to all
truth. This relationship is so ingrained and part of me, that I would cease to exist as a whole
without this personal interaction and being of who I am.

My relationship with the Lord is no different to that which I hear at work as I listen to my
colleagues stories of the events and relationships in their lives. One can see the event and the
outcome of the event based on the relationship and interactions in that situation. I hear the
difficulties occurring within their sphere, from partners to siblings, to having to deal with expartners coming and going, step-family members and family pets in all the highs and lows that
circumnavigate life.

I accept phlebotomists making comments about patients, to staff approaching me as a believer
and asking me to pray for them or someone they love who is presently not well. I do not go out of
my way to dump it down people’s throats. I live my faith openly and as the old saying goes ‘you
are what you eat’. I love to devour God’s living word as each time I open the good book, the Holy
Bible, I receive fresh revelations in the coming of His Kingdom. Beautiful, if not sometimes a little
scary. But as life has proven, a roller coast ride. My faith is me. It is impossible for me to switch it
off. I am an open living book of my faith in which my Lord’s revelations and ways are truthfully
and openly expressed in my daily life. I know of no other way to be. I choose no other way to be.
This is who I am and I shall not cease to be me because they see me as different to them. I love
who I am and who I was created to be. I have a beautiful life, generally, when I am not having to
put up with garbage like this.

One’s interpretation of ‘religious’ differs from person to person, one can religiously go out for a
cigarette every opportune moment. One can have their nose in a book, religiously. I on the other
hand have a ‘faith’, I am not religious, I know what I worship and I see the first hand results of
this relationship with God.

I believe it is my colleagues, those who are making the unjustified complaints, who fail to respect
and tolerate the real me, who are failing to adhere to the Code of Conduct.

There are numerous Christians within the Queensland Health workplace, so much so that a once
a year party is organised involving all levels of staff in the hospital. To witness Gods’ working in
our lives can be quite incredible at times, there will be story swapping of events that have
occurred. Is it my fault that I choose to speak and share of my life story, as my colleagues do their
own. God is working in my life and I see all that He does for me and all that He shares with me in


-----

the same comparison to a colleague discussing how they are feeling sad because their dog has to
have an operation.

Other examples:

`-` A son moving to Chilli to work with his father

`-` To another story of interviewing girls to work in her husband’s brothel

`-` To another who asked God to kill her husband, his new wife was shot dead

`-` To difficulties in relationship with husband and its effect on the kids.

`-` To being sick on a music muster weekend

`-` A daughter being beat up at school

`-` Difficulties experienced in home schooling a child

`-` Catching the photograph of the all but elusive bird

`-` To missing out on Santana concert because their out of town on the night

`-` To teaching one’s son to throw geckoes onto the neighbour’s roof

`-` To grown adult men abusing their power over children involved in a theft situation, when
the gear was handed back and throwing one of the young boys over a fence violently, instead
of giving them a warning and letting them go unharmed.

`-` To the amount one spends on cosmetic surgery for a more youthful appearance.

Do I need to go on? I share the me that is important to me. They share what is important and
relevant to them at the time. I share the real me. I am an open book with my views and my ways. I
am not afraid to discuss my life and values. God is my life and my constant. The aspect of my life

In these examples one can see that ‘your truth is not my truth’ and the differing in understandings;
that everyone’s truths are different based on individuals lifestyles, education, experience and
spiritual preferences and practices.

In the above example of my laboratory colleagues confrontations of what they state are my religious
views in a workplace are perhaps more a display of opposing spiritual practices from those who play
in the many forms of the occult being manipulated by their spiritual practices to come at one who
worships Jesus Christ. Today I now understand that their spiritual manifestations within naturally
react to one who has an inherent way of walking with Jesus Christ that such practitioners will
confront, stir up trouble and set innocent people up. Just as it was done in Jesus Christ ministry,
where he just happened to walk down the street and the demons within a man screamed at Jesus
and said what have You to do with us.

In the Gospel of Mark Chapter one verses twenty three to twenty four there is the moment Jesus is
going about his day when a man in the synagogue with an unclean spirit cried out saying, “Let us
alone! what have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who you
are – the Holy One of God!” ( 1 :23-24)

This happened many times on Jesus journey in many different scenarios by what Christianity would
acknowledge as ‘The Spirit of this World’ or a demon entity filling a troubled soul and such this spirit
sees and recognises the One of God for who they are and hence the confronting situation became a
common outburst by the spiritually oppressed afflicted member in the community when Jesus was
near.

Yet you the reader may not believe or understand this as your truth for many different reasons
despite I acknowledge the truths of spiritual harm.

I have come to understand that in our communities there are many who are practising in the occult
in its many forms and this leaves the members of society open to the same infiltration of harmful
spirits and hence similar confrontations of members who practice highly in the occult to antagonise
those of a Christian belief and practice. The different masters we serve will have different approaches


-----

in the communities we move in, Jesus states for His followers to come in peace and work with good
ethics in all areas of life as if one is serving Jesus himself. Unfortunately, the occult master is Satan
and God the Father warned Satan comes to harm, destroy and kill. Hence the confrontations I seem
to experience on the job.

There are many examples in the Holy Bible that state of people deceiving and telling lies to set
people up and cause trouble and harm. For the nature of the beast is to stir up trouble and do harm.
Why would one think today’s times would be any different.

For whatever reason these laboratory colleagues chose to make such allegations against me using
religion as the precursor I would suspect it is because of the master they serve. An excerpt of the
legal document letter can be found in my free eBook download ‘Called To Stand’ with a word search
of Allegation’ on my WordPress website https://goyathechurchand.me

Community members spiritual practices often bring a conflicts of discord and bones of contention
and varying ethics in the many subjects within a society, along with whose truth is the right truth; the
one true truth. The Nicene Creed is an example where it is spoken ‘We believe in one Lord Jesus
Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true
**God from true God, begotten not made, one in being with the Father.**

I am certain the many politicians who are voting on this proposed amendment change have their
views, beliefs and personal practices and the many sitting on their chairs in parliament will either be
open about their practices or perhaps not speak of their ways for they do not want others to perhaps
know what they dabble in. Witnesses have spoken of devil worship practices naming Australian
politicians that as children they had to watch the horrors of what played out; I recall watching this
adult witness statement and that which was happening before her eyes and experienced as a child.

So again yes, some people’s truths and ways of life are not my way of life and in such occultic
practices I see the harm done.

Imagine if these politicians who were mentioned in this young adult’s statement were able to silence
the truth would such harm and behaviour be so out of control just as the media reports on the out of
control of youth crime and the increasing domestic violence in our communities.

To silence truth is detrimental to society, to the individuals wellbeing in communities and those of
their loved ones. Such oppressive action will breed oppression of an extreme heavy weight that
many in this Nation have not known and perhaps are only now beginning to experience what such a
way of life could truly mean.

To silence truth Governments poor management of public purse funds and the profligate outcome
would not be known and would be kept well hidden. To silence truth governments continuation to
sell the treasures of this land to foreigners and the citizens going without would not be known as to
why so many of the citizens are doing it tough in a land blessed with plenty to provide for all its
citizens. To silence truths shared on social media platforms many of the citizens would miss how the
Australians and State Governments waste the public purse and expect citizens to continue to wear
this in the poor management of public purse funds and perhaps even expect us to wear the brunt of
their poor form by adding more taxes, more infringement fines for one thing or another in attempts
to claw back and top up their kitty again whilst draining citizens small personal purse dwindling
everything they have and leaving them with poor quality of life in living standards as they seek to
replace the dollars lost from the stupidity and egos of their decisions.


-----

To silence individuals truths on social media would mean as a society we would fail to see that we
haven’t come very far at all in many ethical dilemmas that confront our society.

One can read numbers of abortions performed in our cities was getting close to 90,000 in 2017.
(though there is no exact way of knowing the true number unless Medicare release their numbers for
medical benefits claim ). Yet with today’s scientific facts that a 4-6 week foetus has a heartbeat,
between 5 to 10 week growth stage there is development of the major organs & by 10 weeks
muscles and bones have grown and the foetus is recognised as a little human.

Yet 50 years on this is still a significant number of abortions performed despite the science stating
that up to 10 weeks a foetus is recognised as a human and damage will be done to the extremities of
the body and destruction to the essential organs.

With these type of statistics I figured the sex education classes are failing in the truths and directions
that the governments want the children to grow in maturity too. One reads of young ten years
sexually assaulting other children, books teaching the extreme ways of sex and perhaps such ways
being introduced to too young a tender age when acts about the life cycle of new little human would
be more appropriate to the early high school year classes now that year seven students now are
classified as high school.

If I was taught the truths of a life cycle of developing in-utero foetus as a teenager I more than likely
would not have gone ahead with an abortion from a teenage pregnancy if I was taught that it was
more than a clump of cells. Then we read in the media through citizens finding out and sharing the
information that it is big business to sell the body parts and tissue In its many forms of aborted
foetus.

Our Australian government are failing our children and if social media gives us the citizens a platform
to speak our truths to help others make it through then what right should ACMA have to steal our
opportunity to share our truths and help others.

To define truth on the govts own agenda would mean they legalise legislation based on their agendas
and lack of knowledge and understanding. Politicians are not smarter than most Australians, perhaps
it was a financial career path that they chose such a job direction. Governments truths aren’t ideal
and they are often found out to be idling the truth.

My understanding and acknowledgment what we are witnessing today in such violence of differing
opinions, understandings, truths and members in our societies who appear to be demanding you do
as I want you to do and as I want you to believe are the beginnings of this increased oppression and
it all began when the States & Territory repealed the Witchcraft Act.

Many in society do not understand the spiritual nature loosing the occultic practices spirit and
seeking demons for tarot card readings which are all of the Devil’s spirit of harm and that such ways
result in more harm in our communities such as increased youth crime, domestic violence, suicide
and mental health; all are having increasing statistics to an incredible and worldly unmanageable
number. Many people do not believe that Satan exists and they have a belief that there is no God.
Therefore are we getting the changing society that we are experiencing today because people have
ignored truths for too long that many others are aware of.

God the Father warned the people to stay away from all forms of divination practices for it looses
familiar spirits and more. These roam in our societies causing trouble in many forms. One of them
that I am witnessing, it is what the media report as out of control youth crime. The government and
parents and society in general should not be dabbling in the occult of psychic and mediums that


-----

loose familiar spirits that antagonise the children to play up. Therefore if you want someone to
blame for this poor outcome of behaviour, blame yourself the adults and especially the governments
for repealing the Witchcraft Act; in Queensland this was around 1973, nearly fifty years of increasing
the risk of loosing harmful spirits and spiritual practices. This can be same for the increase in
domestic violence, mental health numbers being out of control and still on the rise in nearly all age
groups these days, along with increases in suicide especially in men and the increasing numbers in
youth.

The children are being bullied by familiar spirits jumping from one to another, but many in society
would not understand this for they do not understand the dynamics of spiritual practices and
spiritual warfare; it also appears neither did the politicians who voted to Repeal the Witchcraft Act’.
Have we got the symptoms of a society that thought they knew better than God the Father and now
those we love the most are suffering, and adult society is blaming the young for ways and practices
that they should never had loosed in the first place.

I say, “Who are you to define what is truth and what is untrue and make the decision to censor my
truths over what you pertain to be your own truths.”

“Who are you to define the many that share on the truths and facts of the Gospels and the History of
the Holy Bible and enable such truths to be censored by Social Media Giants.”

ACMA do not have the wisdom to define truth in all concepts of life and society, for in my walk I see
how many are blindsided by the lies of those with hidden agendas and any propaganda that a
government wants to instil in its citizens.

I say again, “Your truth may not be my truth, just as my truth may not be your truth.” Yet it is up to all
discerning adults to seek out the ‘the one true truth’.

Remember President John F. Kennedy & Martin Luther King murdered for wanting to share truths.

Ignorance costs and evil flourishes when good men do nothing.
