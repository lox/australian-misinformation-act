Free speech and the right to voice or publish an opinion is integral to a free society or democracy. Limiting or
punishing free speech, the right to protest, or share opinions is a dangerous thing to do. The little guy already has
almost no say in how their lives are affected by the decisions of those in power, and taking any form of free
speech or punishing people for their opinions is not something a free society does. We already have laws to
protect people from harm. Do not limit or punish Australians for their words. Any step down that path is a
dangerous path to go down.
“Misinformation and disinformation” have proven in the past to be true, and I don’t want politically motivated or
biased people to decide what is and is not “misinformation.” I say no to this bill. I say no to any government who
wants to control what their people say. Australia has many times condemned governments who try to control or
silence their people’s voices. And Australia’s government should be condemned for trying to do anything
remotely similar. No government should get to decide what is said or published, no matter what.
