I have lived in this country for more than seven decades, during which �me I was offered the opportunity to
pursue and fulfil my poten�al. I have worked for the government; I have served in the military and have
raised a family. I have been proud of my country and have appreciated the chance to enjoy a full life.

Sadly, increasingly in the past decade, that situa�on has changed drama�cally to a point where I fear for the
future of my children and grandchildren and genera�ons to follow. This fear arises from the loss of freedom,
manipula�on of poli�cs, societal anger and division, non-democra�c control, emergence of the police state
and restric�on of movement, just to men�on a few. It is an increasingly depressive environment, evidenced
by addic�ons and suicide, which no longer provides meaningful enjoyment and sa�sfac�on.

I have been blessed to live clear of world wars rather than through them and have had the opportunity to
study the responses of totalitarian regimes to control popula�ons for their sinister objec�ves, which
inevitably involve restric�ons on the free flow of ideas and speech.

Accordingly, it is with absolute dismay that I see this environment rapidly emerging in Australia, not only
throughout the pandemic, but more permanently as Australia gives up its sovereign independence to follow
the dictates of the likes of the WEF and the UN.

It is beyond belief that any government organisa�on would propose legisla�on to restrict the free flow of
ideas within society. Quite apart from being uncons�tu�onal, it could well be a cause for a charge of treason.

What is worse, is that ACMA is not a cons�tu�onally recognised government organisa�on but a corporate
en�ty which under the Australian Cons�tu�on 1901 does not have the power to propose or administer laws.
This has been the case since Crown authority was removed from all Acts in 1959.

History shows that whenever a government has implemented laws against free speech, it has created a
draconian society, civil unrest and the eventual demise of those governments. Is this what ACMA wants to
contribute to?

How does ACMA prove that it can be the inerrant arbiter of the truth by determining what is mis-informa�on
and dis-informa�on in the public square? Without such proof, it is inevitable that the “truth” will be dictated
by biased or ill-informed controlling powers.

Throughout history the ques�on has been asked: “What is truth”? Such is the difficulty of iden�fying it.

Over the past few years, we have seen the draconian closing down of debate over COVID. The message of
“safe and effec�ve” was promulgated interna�onally despite the opposing voices of very highly creden�alled
experts. People who spoke out against the narra�ve were blocked, ridiculed and fired. But now, the truth is
emerging with disclosure of patents, concealed research reports, undisclosed contracts, secret commissions,
excess death sta�s�cs, whistleblowers and horrific autopsies. Now countries are withdrawing and banning
mRNA vaccines and medical authori�es pursued to face charges of crimes against humanity.

This is just one salient example. Everywhere I look it seems that governments and big business are promo�ng
and living the LIE and popula�ons are swallowing it to their detriment. We will never find truth unless there
is vigorous and independent debate predicated on free speech.

In �me, those in government and ACMA will move on. How will these people feel about their legacy when
they inevitably see their descendants exis�ng in a prison of censorship? Would they be happy to have their
names and contact details spread across media channels acknowledging that they were the covert authors
seeking to destroy the vibrancy of a free-thinking society? I think not.

I am disgusted by and vehemently opposed to this proposed legisla�on and the only consola�on is that those
who author and promote it will have to spend much more of their lives living under it than me at my age.

I invite them to consider: htps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/07/gary-d-barnet/the-culture-war-againstthinking-individuals-by-the-vast-ideologically-mo�vated-insane/
