While I support the drive to improve on information and 'truth' on digital platforms, who is the one to decide what is truth and what is
not? Truth is subjective, when you really look at it. Maybe it's not so much truth, as a morality issue that should drive this integrity
enquiry.

Post covid, many people seem to have lost their moral compasses, not their ability to stand up for their truth. This has been building
for many decades, even centuries, and we are now seeing the fallout of that excessive control and greed that has guided this
breakdown globally and the powers that be are now struggling to control a status quo of their own making - maybe because they know
the truth is surfacing and they could be toast.

Social media has lost its innocent novelty value, and is now the avenue for the true face of human nature when it's not held to account
for what is said - and we have had decades of misinformation and social conditioning by these powerful conglomerates and other
leadership, which is now resulting in a kind of anarchy, as the 'truth' becomes apparent at the coal-face.

I can also see there is a need to evaluate and/or try to guide those who are acting out their deepest issues under the guise of some
popular agenda, that brings them attention and 'likes'. BUT WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO DECIDE what is true or not for another
person?

This became most obvious during Covid, and the vaccination subject but is not exclusive to it.

The coercion, panic and over-reach of governments, business and personally has shown its own form of truth. But this didn't just
happen with covid and its vaccines, I think it was the rise of billionaires, division of the masses and false 'true' information which has
become the issue. The people are now taking back their truth, whatever that may be and governments are falling because of this. It is
the truth about the poor leadership that has come forward, the greed and power that has for too long been insidiously taking over our
lives, burning workers out, making money and capitalism their God. Who led us to this point??

I have experienced the notion of 'conspiracy theory/ist' for many decades after my son had a severe vaccine reaction.

No one can tell me my child didn't have this reaction, I was there and witnessed the whole thing from go to the present day. The GP I
consulted 'couldn't help him', but he also disclosed that he didn't vaccinate his 6 children 'because I know what goes in them'. When
asked why he hadn't informed me of the side effects, I was told 'I'm not allowed to'. A vaccination nurse dismissed the reaction, as
'collateral damage'.  A friend once screamed at me in a cafe stating my son's situation 'didn't happen' - even though she had not been
in our lives through any of that time. I didn't mind that she believed in vaccination, but she, as a doctor's daughter, clearly felt
threatened knowing that something she believed in, might have truth to the contrary. And I recently ended a 50yr friendship, because
this friend refused me entry to her home because I would have to vaccinate to be welcome, even after offerring a PCR, RAT test and
social distancing just to have coffee and chat. She stated 'I believe in vaccination'. There's that word again.

I don't think I'm the hysterical one in any of these cases. After so many years of being judged, I couldn't care less if a person is
vaccinated or not.

And this is where the problem lies with the vax subject - people have been led to believe in something that has shown to be false
repeatedly, but the message of 'safe and effective' was cleverly marketed and experienced, the actual 'truth-tellers' and facts derided,
pariahed...and then there was covid, where the vaccines have proven to be flawed, but still the lack of accountability as the truth
surfaces, and the true diehards, continue the belief, fed by scientific 'research' and pharmaceutical 'proof', which is in fact second hand
information peddled by a willing doctor, who gets incentivised to promote a procedure.

We saw much more of what we believed, not just on vaccines, start to crumble during covid and the people having been speaking up

accountability?? Vaccination is not the one area where this takes place, it is one of many.

You tell me. It looks to me like the misinformation of the past is now merging with the truth of the present, and we are in chaos.

My story is only one, and I have been abused, attacked, derided, ignored and dismissed for years for it, most of it on social media but I stand with resolve, knowing this was a truth, an undeniable experience of misleading, even perhaps well-intentioned, information
that lead to my son's incident, with no accountability from the people who caused it to be.

I appreciate the good intent but who is going to be the truth-teller - the one given the right to decide, with all their biases and
misinformation? The one peddling an agenda? Or the one who had the experience?

yours sincerely,
Peta Robinson
