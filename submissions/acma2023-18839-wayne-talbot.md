On Informafion

Inform: from the Lafin informare: “to shape, give form to,
delineate”, or figurafively, “to train, instruct, educate”.

Misinformafion: incorrect or misleading informafion.

Logically, if one does not inform accurately or fully, then they
misinform and mislead. They give incorrect “shape” or “form”
to a subject, or fail to “delineate” the breadth of the subject,
failing to properly instruct or educate.

Now, consider the case where polificians tell only part of the
story, obfuscate, or give answers that evade directly answering
the quesfion. Clearly, they communicate misinformafion, just
as the Australian Labor Party is doing in relafion to the
referendum on the Voice to Parliament. Our Prime Minister,
Anthony Albanese accuses the “No” voters of spreading
misinformafion, but that is only by his definifion, which is
suspect.

I have pondered the issue whilst listening to the arguments of
both sides, and have concluded with my own thoughts.
Emphasis – _my thoughts. I am not always right, but my_
conclusions are always well considered, as objecfively as
possible. I publish my thoughts for others to consider, not to
misinform or mislead. The danger I find in this proposed
legislafion is the suppression of free speech, when such views
refute or rebut government statements. An even greater
danger is that governments are excused from this legislafion,
allowing them to deliberately mislead but not be held to
account. The very essence of democracy, “government by the
people”, is that the people be allowed to hold governments to
account, through ongoing public dialogue, not just through
periodic elecfions. By the fime an elecfion comes around, the

damage will already be done, just as it will be done if this
legislafion is allowed to pass.

We must never allow any government to be above the people
it is sworn to represent. We must never allow any government
to silence dissent. This proposed legislafion presents an ever
present danger to our democracy, an imminent threat to the
freedom of the Australian people.
