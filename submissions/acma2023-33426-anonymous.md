This bill restricts freedom of expression in an unreasonable way. One way in
which the truth is discovered is through discourse and debate (online and in
person). This proposed bill would severely and unreasonably limit both of these.
Truth is often ambiguous and nuanced. Truth is not handed down by authority
rather it reveals itself through discussion and discovery. This bill seeks to instill
authoritarian powers into a government body that will seemingly become an
arbiter of truth. This set-up does not protect people from wrong information, is
unreasonably disrupts the discovery of truth and the freedom of expression
