My name is and I’m writing to you to voice my opinion in regard to the proposed

‘Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023.’

In the name of Democracy and free speech enshrined in our constitution, I strongly object to this
proposal and the means by which it is to implemented.

Any Government authority given the power to control our right to speak and/or listen freely to a
wide platform of information sources is totalitarian and Orwellian by its very nature.

One only has to look back to World War 2 to see how far a dominant and narcissistically driven
individual (Hitler) can turn a whole nation in on itself and cause worldwide ramifications.

The propaganda driven Nazis rose to power on the basis of pushing their agenda through the ranks
of government to oppress the common man to believe that everything they pushed forward was in
the best interest of the Aryan race.

If we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat it.

Misinformation and Disinformation will always be part of developed social civilizations, because
humans in general want to believe that they each know what is best for the greater population at
large.

How is it even plausible to believe for one moment that a government elected by the people on the
basis of random promises and payola, is going to be able to efficiently and without malice, control
the alternative and main stream media with an honest and open heart which everyone will see is
true to its word.

One only has to see and hear the Misinformation and Disinformation dished out by our government
health departments to our populace over the last 3 years, regarding the COVID pandemic and the
ridiculous measures we were forcefully compelled to comply with.

Common sense and rational decision making went out the window when state of emergency rules,
gave too much power to control freaks within the establishment. Many of the decisions and
outcomes from that time have and still cause great distress among many in our community.

Here’s another example of why I’m failing to believe in the ability of our government to make
balanced and rational decisions for the betterment of us all:

How can a government justify the virtues of being environmentally minded by pushing large scale
solar and wind powered electricity, closing coal powered generators, locking up vast tracks of
bushland and stopping logging, while not approving clean and efficient nuclear power stations, but
yet still go ahead and buy nuclear powered and armed submarines ready to take us (oops protect us)
in the event of a war with China and take us all to Armageddon. It defies logic in my opinion.

My parents and many other migrants made the huge sacrifice to leave their oppressed home
countries and come to this great nation of ours because of its democratic freedoms. Let’s hope they
didn’t do this in vain to the detriment of their descendants.

Thank you.
