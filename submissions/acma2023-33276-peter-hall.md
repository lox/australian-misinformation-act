# Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and


# Disinformation) Bill 2023


# To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts:


# l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)


# Bill 2023.


My submission is different to that of others. I see that every time this government asks for the opinion of the people
it wants to only push its agenda without listening to the people at all.

The “Voice” proposal was put out there for the people to choose what they want but we have been told today
Saturday 19 August 2023 that the prime minister has demanded that his party members get out there and try to
force every person in Australia to support his proposal which is the “Yes” view.

This legislation (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill) is aimed to prevent opposition and to force the
governments’ view on its people which is the exact opposite of meaningful government where politicians are elected
to seek the view of their constituents or those who elected them and convey those views to the government to
provide a voice for the people who they represent in the parliament.

This bill seeks to prevent anything against the agenda of the government from even being heard so that only the
government view will prevail thus nullifying the actual process of government and perverting the view of justice for
the people of this nation or country.

This bill needs to be removed from the process of government as it goes against the very foundation of just
government. It signals the end of fair and democratic government when the government of the day seeks to silence
any voice that opposes what it wants to do.

I know that any mention of God to this government signals opposition to the spokesperson but the reason that this
government is in place is because God has allowed it but it would seem that only the opinions of those who are antiChristian are the only ones that are listened to now and not anyone who chooses to try and obey God who is the very
being who was respected when this nation was formed. This indicates how far from the original concept of
democratic government we have come in Australia now where the views of those in power are to overrule all other
views.

Australia is vocal about other governments around this world who want to suppress the rights of individuals while
this government now seeks to do the same.

Please do not reject my submission as someone with an opposing view who should be silenced.

Thanks, in anticipation of your consideration of my submission against this bill.

Peter Hall
