Re Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023

This Bill is monstrous. It proposes to put in the hands of 6 people, and presumably the
Government, the decision about what is ‘misinformation’ and what is ‘disinformation’ and
could ‘harm the Australian public’. And it gives them the power to punish online media
organisations for inadequately censoring what they, ACMA, deem to be incorrect. This would
be the end of freedom of speech and democracy in Australia. It is Orwellian. It would mean for
example the end of availability of online discussion of scientific research that doesn’t agree with
the Government agenda. Science is never a done deal, it is an ongoing process of research,
discussion and analysis and meta-analysis. The Australian people don’t need to be treated like
children with the Government protecting them from information that could ‘harm’ them. This
censorship is the source of harm. Freedom of speech online and offline is what will protect the
Australian people from harm…. and from a dictatorial and tyrannical government that is serving
its own ends, not the needs of the people.
