To Whom lt May Concern,

I am writing to you to express my concern about'The Misinformation and Disinformation Bill,.

As the 'Universol Declaration of Humon Rights' states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression, this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to see, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers,,.

Also, the 'Austra lian Human Rights Commissron'states: "There is a real risk that efforts to combat online
misinformation and disinformation by foreign-actors could be used to legitirnise attempts to restrict pubtic
debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce ideological conformity in Australia". They also state: 'All
efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation need to be accompanied by transparency and scrutiny
safeguards to ensure any limitations imposed upon freedom of expression are no greater then absolutely
necessary and strictly justified".

I completely agree with the above concerns, and believe their concerns are not addressed in this Bill. I also
believe this bill will impose some of the most draconian controls of free speech in the Western world. They
are totally inconsistent with Australia's 'lnternational Human Rights' obligations and really are an over-reach
on steroids when compared to the 'Declaration of Human Rights'.

This Bill would enable Government bureaucrats, who are not elected by the people to represent us, working
through big-tech to silence and censor speech that way exceeds reasonable limitation. lt puts too much
power in their hands without transparency or accountability. The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard
of accountability and oversight for the misuse of these censorship powers.

The framework of this Bill is too vague in its definition of what is false, misleading, oF deceptive, as is the
definition of harm. This risks it being weaponised, which could potentially shut down legitimate concerned
public debate regarding political policies or decisions by Government. The Media is also free of
accountability in this regard and therefore have the potential to be corrupted which could lead to heavy
handed Government or authoritarian control.

I do not believe it is the role of the digital platforms to police and remove any misinformation and
disinformation. The severity of the penalties to the providers and platforms for fuiling to comply are
excessive and are a restrictive control of debating controversial issues. lt is a Bill that does not safeguard
people's rights to free speech. lt gives Government, Bureaucrats, and mainstream media too much power.
They will have no watchdog and potentially have the unsolicited authority to say and enforce anything they


-----

This is a very disappointing and underprepared Bill. t cannot see any good in the Bill, only harm from a
Government narrative which clearly portrays a doctrine of 'My way or the Highway'. ls this Government so
intimidated by the Australian people that they need to vet every persont correspondence.

I am appalled at the potential danger to the public and at the precariousness of this Bill.

Yours sincerely

Shirley James
