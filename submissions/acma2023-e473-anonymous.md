As a sovereign of Australia I am concerned about governmental overreach. This current proposal appears to violate our
Freedom of Speech which is a God given right.
It is essential that every individual has the right to read, ask and investigate any topic of concern to that individual without any
censorship.
In the United States, once a Beacon of Freedom, this proposal was defeated by the Supreme court. Should we present
Australia in an Orwellian fashion, or stand proudly as a nation of freethinkers?
