**Feedback on an exposure draft of the Communication Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

I am deeply concerned about this Bill and its draconian nature and undemocratic
implications.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

A country without free speech is not a democracy. Free speech and the free flow of
information while enabling free debate are prerequisites to democracy. A country that
does anything to curb free discussion of subjects that may impact its citizens
undermines citizens’ freedom of choice and informed consent.

A true democracy allows individual citizens, who are not of significant wealth or without
a mainstream-media presence, the means to be able to formulate their own opinions
and views and make their own decisions. This Bill seeks to limit this ability and deny
large segments of the population the means to think out loud, to ask questions and
speak freely on media platforms, thereby diminishing freedom of expression and
quashing debate.

The past three years have shown that government and establishment authorities do
indeed get information wrong. Misinformation and unknowable assertions (such as,
“safe and effective”) were repeatedly made by government representatives and
authorities. Like many Australians, I now know that the information and assertions were
often more accurate from earnest professionals who endeavoured to provide balanced
information and who simply made more sense. We also saw the media platforms often
censor and “deplatform” these experts, and subsequently we saw media and various
authorities slander and “cancel” them. Censoring such opinions/views only degrades
our democracy, particularly when the sources are subject-matter experts or the citations
of such experts or other related academic sources. To exert pressure for the censorship
of such information for an alleged public benefit or good that cannot be substantiated is
draconian. It treats Australians as fools, like vulnerable little children. It is infantilising,
condescending and infuriating, and deeply undermines trust across domains.

When adults are not given the opportunity to be able to access and review information
for themselves, the levels of trust of doctors, scientists, government authorities,
academia and media are in my opinion likely to degrade further, resulting in more
refusal/resistance and opposition. As a human resources manager for many years, I
know only too well that enabling staff to be well-informed and providing opportunities to
ask questions is paramount to ensure a cohesive and productive workplace. Trust and
cooperation die when communication breaks down.

In short, pressuring platforms to shut down access to information and preventing us
from determining for ourselves what is likely to be true or false or unknowable is curbing
the most basic of freedoms. This ability underscores the fundamentals of living in a
liberal democracy.

THE COMPLEXITY OF CONTENT EXEMPTIONS

How do we know what is true? The honest answer is no one can really know because
nobody is always right. And truth is only ever established over time and with the free
flow of information while allowing open debate.

Science is never settled and science is never a consensus. A single piece of evidence
can negate a previously unfalsified scientific finding.

These past three years we saw government and authorities deem themselves allknowing. Why did they think they could divine the precise truth? Where was the
requisite humility acknowledging things can be complicated and unknowable? Anyone
who thinks only they can possess the truth is channelling the likes of Mussolini. No
country can be free if the government is the arbiter of truth. The Australian government
does not have right to dictate to the digital industry what is true and what is not true on
behalf of Australians.

How will misinformation and disinformation be established? Who are the “fact-checkers”
who establish what is true? Who will oversee the fact-checkers who establish the
“authorised information”?

Who will be accountable if the “authorised information” is found later to be
misinformation or disinformation? What if Australians are harmed by this “authorised
information”?

How can content authorised by an Australian State or Federal Government, including
political advertising, be deemed never misinformation or disinformation? Why is
“professional news content” not deemed possible misinformation or disinformation?
How can these blanket assumptions be inequitably applied when distortions and lies are
commonly aired by politicians and media?

It is naïve in the extreme to assume that Australians will trust anyone who uses the
words “disinformation” or “misinformation”. Historically, we know those who use such
terms mean “opinions that run contrary to mine that I should be allowed to suppress”.

The claim that any information is 100% knowable is disingenuous and the fact that
government and mainstream media are assumed exempt from being wrong is alarming
and insulting. There are no definitions of misinformation or disinformation that can be
deemed fair and reasonable in the context of this Bill.

THE SCOPE OF THE PRIVATE MESSAGE EXEMPTION

Unless clear criminality is established, under no circumstances should privatemessaging services be included within the scope of this Bill.

Such an action would be a flagrant breach of our basic right to privacy. A system of
government like this, one that is centralised and dictatorial, requiring complete
subservience to the state, is called a totalitarian regime.

THE SIZE OF THE PENALTIES AND ANY OTHER ISSUES

We already have laws to ensure those committing the crime of slander or libel or
incitement can face criminal charges. That is sufficient to stem harmful communication
and media.


-----

If people vandalise property, such as mobile carrier sites, that is a criminal offence and
should be treated as such as has always been the case. More information may help to
prevent such criminal behaviour while censorship will likely exacerbate such
behaviours.

The definition of ‘harm’ in the Bill is dangerously broad. Harm should only relate to that
which is evident, objective and with intent, not inferred or subjective.

CONCLUSION

I ask that this Bill does not proceed or is very significantly amended. I sincerely hope
that Australia does not continue its trajectory of the past three years which made me
reflect on my time spent 40 years ago as an exchange student touring East Germany.
Our East German guides repeated the “authorised information” of the State with
stunning unerring conviction. I thought myself so fortunate to live in Australia.

Historically, the censorship as proposed by this Bill has never proved to be a path to
engagement, enlightenment and betterment but rather a road towards apathy,
ignorance and stagnation. To remain a free and liberal democracy, we would do best by
rejecting the entire premise of this Bill.
