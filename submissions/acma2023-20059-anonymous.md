**Misinformation and disinformation Legislation Submission**

I am totally against this proposed legislation. I believe this legislation is Orwellian in its current
form and both the Federal and State governments want to play big brother and completely
censor us and shut down freedom of expression.

It appears the government has two different rules, one for themselves and one for the people.
We the people will be subjected to big brother scrutiny and shut down if we should challenge
government officials etc. and are found to be spreading so called ‘misinformation or
disinformation’. We will be banned and/or excessively fined for speaking out and spreading what
they deem is untrue.

I don’t believe governments should be excluded from scrutiny and being challenged for speaking
misinformation and untruths themselves? I believe in appropriate standards or codes of conduct
being set for all, including governments. Ordinary people should not be the ones to face bans and
or exorbitant fines. Government officials should be held to account and ‘suffer’ the same
consequences as the people they are serving. I firmly believe we should not be legislating free
speech at all!
