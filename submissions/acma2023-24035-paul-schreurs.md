**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**
**2023.**

I reject this Bill in its entirety.

As we already have laws to protect people from harm, we do not need to impede on people
communicating in whatever form, on digital platforms. We certainly do not need or want a
bureaucratic department determining what is misinformation and disinformation especially as they
are open to broad interpretation.

This Bill enables any government at any time to control the flow of information. This could be used to
neutralise any oppositional view of the government, subverting democracy.

Freedom of speech, regardless of its content, is important for a free functioning society. It is
comforting to see speech and opinion that align with your own, however, speech and opinion that do
not align is essential for any society or people to progress. If the speech or opinion is harmful or
hateful, this will strengthen your own position. If it is challenging your own, this allows for your own
position to be reflected on and often amended to accommodate new information. All information is
good, even that which you reject, as it allows for a balanced view.

Freedom of speech and opinion is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under
Article 19 “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.” This was put in place to protect all people from potentially
totalitarian regimes.

We have laws in place that protect people from harm. Another layer of legislation will only impede
on those who mean no harm.
