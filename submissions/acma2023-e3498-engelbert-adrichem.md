To whom it may concern,

I believe the proposed misinformation/ disinformation bill 2023 to be a major overreach.
From what I understand the government and legacy media is exempt from the imposition of the bill.

As we have witnessed over the last few years, Governments and mainstream media outlets at all levels were
distributing their own misinformation and disinformation when they pushed for mass vaccination using products which
were said to be safe and effective. Time has shown that the vaccines are neither.
The only location where any truth could be located at this time was on some comments and posts on some social
media outlets.
There were some politicians who opposed the mass-vaccination policies. The comments of these politicians would
have been sensored if this bill were in existence at the time.

An example of sensorship over reach was a Facebook group called "Died Suddenly". This was where people were
able to tell their stories of vaccine injury and death. After reaching around 100000 members, and getting the attention
of mainstream media, the page was cancelled by Facebook.
Another example, is the way protests were reported in the mainstream media. Protests in Sydney where there were
around 100000 protesters were reported as having hundreds of protesters.
With the above in mind, if the right to free speech is removed by placing restrictions on what the public is able to say
and read on social media, the Government is robbing the public of the ability of making their own decisions with all of
the facts at hand whomever they are dispensed by.
Therefore, I completelyoppose the proposed misinformation/ dysinformation bill 2023..

Warmest regards.
