# Communications Legislation Amendment 
 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

**To whom it may concern**

The proposed legislation / amendments represent a blatant attempt by the federal government to
introduce censorship of well-known social media outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and
others, under the disguise of “protecting the community from harm”. The bill would give the
government huge power to impose massive fines on social media outlets if they refuse to act to
remove posts which are deemed to be “misinformation” or “disinformation” in their content.

Whenever the word “censorship” is used, the overriding question then becomes: “who or what is
_the ultimate authority that judges what contents should be censored?” According to the proposed_
legislation, that authority would be the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA.

We have just been through 3 Covid years where the medical establishment misled the Australian
people, and our politicians who believed the lies they were told and consequently enforced
scientifically inappropriate restrictions on all Australians, and attacked anyone who voiced an
opposing view. For example:

1. Those who stated that Covid vaccines were not highly effective were attacked - but were

subsequently proved to be correct.

2. Those who stated that Covid vaccines were not very safe were attacked – but were

subsequently proved to be correct.

3. Those who said from February 2020 onwards that there were safe and inexpensive options

available to both prevent and treat Covid were attacked – but were subsequently proved
to be correct.
I could give another dozen examples, and in every case if a
Government authority like the proposed ACMA were in charge of deciding what was
misinformation and/or disinformation they would certainly have supported the
Government line, and would have incorrectly censored true statements.

The potential for immense misuse of power is clear, especially when the Government in power
blindly supports massive international organisations (in the case of Covid - the multinational
pharmaceutical cartels) whose deliberate intention was/is to mislead for financial gain. This
applies to Governments of all political hues.

Comments made by US President Harry Truman, some 73 years ago, appear to me to be as
relevant and important as ever. The following quote is taken from Truman’s “Special Message” to
Congress re the matter of the internal security of the United States
(https://www.realclearpublicaffairs.com/articles/2023/05/12/great_american_stories_trumans_q
uote_899217.html):

“Laws forbidding dissent do not prevent subversive activities; they merely drive them into more
secret and more dangerous channels…… Once a government is committed to the principle of
silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of
increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a
country where everyone lives in fear. We must, therefore, be on our guard against extremists who
urge us to adopt police state measures.”

And this ACMA legislation, as confusing and as devious as it is, is one small step away from a police
state measure.

The potential dangers of free speech pale into insignificance compared to the potential dangers
contained in this legislation which can in a deliberate way prevent truth spoken by independent
persons being heard – as happened during Covid - and is still happening.

This legislation is not needed. It should be simply rejected by all who support the Westminster
system of democratic Government. And for those whose don’t support our form of democracy, it
should still be rejected because it provides a clear opportunity for powerful vested interests to
subvert truth telling on a national scale. I am a proud Australian - and this legislation is simply
un-Australian.
