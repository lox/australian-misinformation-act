To whom it may concern:

This bill is an abomination and should be instinctively repulsive to anyone with a liberal, democratic bone in their
body.

The premise that an independent regulator is capable of ascertaining, let alone arbitrating, the truth, falsity, or
"harmful" aspects of any communication to maximise citizens' "well-being" is dystopian gaslighting.

No Australian needs to hear opinions filtered through the mind of a public bureaucrat so that it's sanitised for public
consumption. That anyone could even suggest such a thing without physically recoiling in horror is deeply troubling

The only "disinformation" we need protection from is anyone suggesting that a Bill like this has a place in a free,
democratic society.
