This bill is something I would expect to be implemented in a communist country where the government is trying to suppress media
and independent journalists from giving the public another perspective on current issues affecting them, their families and all other
Australians.

Using the "Voice" as an example so far all the information has been directed towards the "Yes" campaign, not one mention of
"No".

To me presenting both sides should be the fair thing to do. At the moment all you hear is yes, quote obviously this is the
preferred outcome.

My choice should be made by having all the facts presented to me and making my own decision.

Another overreach by the grubberment.

I will contact my federal member and the office of the Prime Minister to voice my disapproval of the proposal.

I say no to this amendment.

Thank you.

Gerard Potter.
