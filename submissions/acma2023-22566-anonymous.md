In February 1633, a devout Catholic was summoned to Rome by the Pope to appear before the inquisitor
and be charged.

On 22 June the sentence was delivered:

1. The defendant was found "vehemently suspect of heresy" namely of having held the opinions
that the Sun lies mofionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and
moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared
contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.

2. He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisifion, which was
commuted to house arrest, under which he remained for the rest of his life.

3. His book was banned; and he was later forbidden from publishing any exisfing or future work.

In September 1854, an obstetrician approached town officials with the results of his private research,
although skepfical the town officials followed his advice. However, the authorifies knew that his
reasoning was fundamentally wrong and therefore dismissed his crackpot ideas.

It was not unfil 1866 and many years after his death that the authorifies decided that he may in fact have
been correct.

The above stories, although occurring centuries apart, tell an all too familiar story; that the prevailing
authorifies are all too quick to believe themselves to be infallible while anyone who voices a dissenfing
view is roundly declared to be a peddler of lies, heresies and to use modern parlance – misinformafion
and disinformafion.

Of course, we now know that Galileo was correct, and the Pope (and his advice from God) was wrong.
We also know that the once widely accepted “Miasma” theory was enfirely wrong and that Dr John
Snow was correct in poinfing to contaminated water as the source of cholera.

Unfortunately, the above incidents are by no means isolated and the track record of Australian
governments being infallible is poor – the cane toad being but one of many examples!

If it is the government’s posifion that it is now sufficiently wise and enlightened that it would never
repeat such egregious errors, then I would counsel it to consider that it cannot guarantee that the
consfituents of a future government or the board charged to manage the proposed “Combafing
Misinformafion and Disinformafion Bill” would be similarly blessed. It is noteworthy that the Pope was
surrounded by the most educated men of his fime, and even with the apparent divine guidance of God,
was unable to deduce that in fact Galileo was correct in his views.

What tests does the government intend to embody in the legislafion to determine what is true and what
is “misinformafion” (false informafion) or “disinformafion” (deliberately false informafion)?

How will ‘potenfial’ be weighed, and what is the threshold test for “serious harm”?

Frankly, the proposed legislafion would be more at home in Orwell’s totalitarian state than in a modern
free democrafic nafion and anyone approving this legislafion should give serious considerafion as to the
potenfial consequences for themselves and their families should they ever find themselves on the wrong
side of any future governments approved ‘Truth’.
