To whom it may concern,

I would like to express my total objection to this ‘mis/disinformation’ bill.

Not only does it lead us further toward the horrors of Orwell's total authoritarian nightmare of 1984, but the
government can't be trusted to oversee anything like that. No one can, information must be filtered through open
discussion, not censored via easily corruptible groups of people.

If garbage like this bill passes I'll deeply question if this is the right country for my family, future children & our tax
dollars.

Truly despicable to even consider such a bill.
