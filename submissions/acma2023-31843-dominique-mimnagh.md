For critical thinking to occur debate on a subject must be allowed. For example for Science to be
Science, we must be able to question it. How can we expect to live in a democracy with out free
speech? No free speech, no democracy. Who will these "Fact Checker's be employed by? The
Government? Who will fact check the fact checkers? This piece of legislation scares the living day
lights out of me and it should scare you too. I would like to say it's the biggest overreach of the
Labour Government but in my opinion mandating the Covid jab was but it's not far behind. The
Government told us that the jab was "safe and effective", that was certainly misinformation. If it was
effective, why did so many people get Covid? If it was safe why are more people dying now than
they did in the height of the pandemic? Excess unexplained deaths have increased by 17% in
Australia but no one is talking about it and the Government has refused to have a royal commission.
Why aren't these deaths being investigated? In my opinion the Government have been the biggest
perpetrators for spreading misinformation and yet if this legislation gets approved, they will be
exempt from it.

What was deemed as misinformation at the start of the pandemic ended up as being the truth 6
months later. Look at the Sharri Marri reports on the pandemic on Skynews. Her reports were
deemed misinformation and she was riduculed by other media outlets and yet it prompted further
investigaton by the Biden Government and it was later deemed to be true that the virus was leaked
from a Wuhan lab. This orwelian piece of legislation is all about the Government trying to control
debate so they can control legislation. We are not a Communist Country, so do not try to impose
communist policies on us. If you do, I am confident their will be civil unrest.
