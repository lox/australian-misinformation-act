**public.**

**1** **Introduction**

Catholic Education Tasmania (CET) welcomes the opportunity to provide a
submission in response to the Exposure Draft of the _Communications_ _Legislation_
##### Amendment (Combating Misinformation And Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Bill).

CET directly operates 35 Catholic schools in Tasmania, and has oversight of 3
other Catholic schools in Tasmania, those being operated by Edmund Rice
Education Australia and the Salesians of Don Bosco. There are approximately
16,500 students enrolled in Tasmanian Catholic schools for the school year
2023. Approximately 3,500 Tasmanians are employed (full and part-time) in our
organisation.

**2** **Overview**

**_“Everyone_** **_has_** **_the_** **_right_** **_to_** **_freedom_** **_of_** **_opinion_** **_and_** **_expression;_** **_this_** **_right_**
**_includes_** **_freedom_** **_to_** **_hold_** **_opinions_** **_without_** **_interference_** **_and_** **_to_** **_seek,_** **_receive_**
##### and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.

**United** **Nations** **Universal** **Declaration** **of** **Human** **Rights**

While there is no doubt that deliberate spreading of disinformation can be harmful
to individuals and society as a whole, it is fundamental to a free and functional
##### democracy that there is freedom of speech.

CET has serious concerns that the Bill will unduly impact on the legitimate
exercise of free speech.

We hold these concerns notwithstanding the exemptions contained for educational
institutions, which are addressed specifically later in this submission.

Our objection stems from our concerns about the impact the bill would have in general
on the exercise of the fundamental freedom of expression, as well as the impact on
the important and associated freedom of religion.

In CET schools robust, truthful and respectful debate and discussion is strongly


-----

to assess different arguments and to make judgements about what is true and what is
false. It involves being exposed to a wide variety of ideas and opinions, and subjecting
them to the objective judgement of faith, reason and natural law. In teaching the
scientific method, our students are encouraged to test hypotheses and expose them
to rigorous scrutiny. They learn that history has shown that some assertions or
conclusions which are considered to be false by most in society are later proven to be
true, and that the reverse has also occurred on many occasions, including in recent
memory.

Further, we believe in the importance of the free expression of views whether they are
popular or unpopular. The Catholic Church throughout the centuries has articulated its
beliefs about the world in which we live and the nature of truth and the transcendent.
Sometimes these views are unpopular.

Accordingly, we are concerned that due to the broad nature of the Bill and the manner
in which ‘harm’ is widely construed in some parts of society, that views that are merely
unpopular could be deemed to be harmful and ultimately, censored. The incentive
structure of the proposed Bill will be for digital operators to suppress information, if in
doubt. It would not be fanciful to envisage a scenario where these digital operators
choose to censor views which are merely unpopular      - all under the guise of complying
with the law against misinformation.

**Freedom** **of** **Religion**

##### Catholic Education Tasmania (CET) is a formal, legal and legitimate outreach of the Catholic Church. We have a strong commitment to the fundamental right of all people
to freedom of religion. Essential to freedom of religion is the freedom to express deeply
held religious beliefs, including in the public square. The bill, as currently drafted, has
the potential to impact on these fundamental rights.

We support and endorse the views expressed by Archbishop of Hobart Julian
Porteous in his submission indicating opposition to the Bill. It is unfortunately a matter
##### of public record that Archbishop Porteous was subject to a discrimination claim for
simply expressing the Catholic Church’s long-standing teachings about marriage. It is
an example of where perfectly reasonable speech is deemed by some to be ‘harmful’
to others. Seen in this context, the Bill has the potential to act to suppress legitimate
speech on the basis that individuals or digital platform operators or ACMA deem
speech, _which_ _they_ _happen_ _to_ _disagree_ _with,_ to be ‘harmful’.

**Exemptions** **for** **Educational** **Institutions**

CET notes that educational institutions are purportedly exempt from the operation of
this Bill. While this does not change our fundamental disagreement with the Bill, and
(as detailed further below) we believe this exemption does not go far enough,
nevertheless, we welcome the exemption.

If the Bill is to proceed, the exemptions for education institutions must be maintained
and clarified to ensure that individuals within education institutions are also exempt.
There is always a risk, with the passage of such a Bill containing these exemptions,
##### that over time the law creeps into more and more areas of speech regulation by
gradually removing these exemptions as being seen to be no longer necessary or
unfair.


-----

##### government highlights the problematic nature the Bill itself. If the proposed
legislation will not do anything other than ensure that misinformation and
disinformation is less prevalent on digital media, then it is reasonable to ask why
##### government for instance would need a special exemption from the operation of the
legislation.

However, if the Bill is to proceed, and re-iterating our in-principle opposition, CET
would argue that in addition to the current exemptions in the Bill, exemptions should
also be provided for other types of speech, including religious speech.

**3** **Concerns** **in** **detail**

Our primary concerns about the Bill are outlined as follows:

(a) Generally, the prospect of a statutory regime whereby a government
agency is empowered to actively monitor content on the internet to
determine what amounts to _“misinformation”_ or _“disinformation”_ that is
_“reasonably_ _likely_ _to_ _cause_ _or_ _contribute_ _to_ _serious_ _harm”_ speaks against a
##### society that values freedom of expression, and one which already operates
within the bounds of anti-discrimination legislation.

There are 2 key issues in this regard.

First, the Bill provides for a regulatory body, the Australian Communications
and Media Authority **(ACMA)** to be invested with a coercive function, and
the practical power to determine what is, and isn’t “misinformation” (as
defined) on the internet, whether or not the information is on an Australian
website.

The possible punishments where the Bill is breached are potentially
extremely high. There appears to be limited built in ‘checks and balances’
on ACMA’s use of this power. For example, ACMA would be given the
##### power to obtain information and documents from any person ACMA has a
reason to believe has information or a document relevant to misinformation
##### or disinformation on a digital platform.1 This is obviously an exceptionally
broad power. The privilege against self-incrimination is abrogated such that
a person is not excused from providing documents or evidence on the basis
##### that it might tend to incriminate them2. This abrogation is tempered only in
respect of _criminal_ _proceedings_ against the person3. However, many of the
penalties under the Bill are civil penalties; meaning that a person may be
compulsorily required to give information or evidence which could then be
used against them in civil penalty proceedings.

Second, the Bill provides that content that is _“authorised_ _by_ _the_
_Commonwealth_ _ora_ _State_ _ora_ _territory_ _ora_ _local_ _government_ by definition
_cannot_ be misinformation.4 There appears to be no limit on how such
‘authorisation’ may be granted by a relevant government.

This application of “authority” creates an inherently uneven playing field
##### where information, no matter how false, misleading, or otherwise
objectionable, that is authorised by the state cannot fall foul of the Act.
Indeed, some content may be authorised by, by one local council, but not
by another creating the potential for conflicting “authority” by a local
government.

1 The Bill, clause 19.
2 The Bill, clause 21 (1)
3 The Bill, clause 21 (2)
4 The Bill, clause 2, definition of _“excluded_ _content_ _for_ _misinformation_ _purposes”,_ par (e)


-----

The Bill defines misinformation as follows:

_(1)_ _For_ _the_ _purposes_ _of_ _this_ _Schedule,_ _dissemination_ _of_
##### content using a digital service is misinformation on the digital service if:

_(a)_ _the_ _content_ _contains_ _information_ _that_ _is_ _false,_
##### misleading or deceptive; and

_(b)_ _the_ _content_ _is_ _not_ _excluded_ _content_ _for_
_misinformation_ _purposes;_ _and_

_(c)_ _the_ _content_ _is_ _provided_ _on_ _the_ _digital_ _service_ _to_
_one_ _or_ _more_ _end-users_ _in_ _Australia;_ _and_

_(d)_ _the_ _provision_ _of_ _the_ _content_ _on_ _the_ _digital_ _service_
_is_ _reasonably_ _likely_ _to_ _cause_ _or_ _contribute_ _to_
_serious_ _harm._

Disinformation is then similarly defined, except that it includes a
requirement for an intent to deceive or mislead.

There are several problems with this definition:

(i) How is ACMA to decide what content contains _“information”_ that is
false misleading or deceptive”, as opposed to content continuing
“opinions”, “comment”, “facts”, “suppositions”, or “hypotheses” (or
indeed a combination of such things) which may be false or
misleading?

Moreover, it is unclear how such “information” caught by the Bill
would be distinguished from other content such as opinions or
statements of faith, particularly in the context of the sheer volume of
information available and being produced each day on the internet.
It is more concerning as to how the ACMA is expected to arbitrate
those matters.

(ii) How is ACMA to decide what is _“false,_ _misleading,_ _or_ _deceptive”,_
without reference to some objective standard? Many statements are
made that others will consider to be false or misleading. Moreover,
many statements are neither clearly “false” or “true” in any truly
measurable or objective sense. Many reasonable and fair
statements about matters touching on religion, art or politics clearly
fall into this category where large sections of the public have different
and respectful views, a situation to be encouraged and nurtured in a
free and democratic society. None of those domains is subject to an
exemption.

(iii) How is ACMA to determine whether such information is reasonably
likely to cause or contribute to ‘serious harm’?

(c) Though we are opposed to the Bill in principle, the definition of _“excluded_
##### content for the misinformation purposes” provided for within the bill is too
narrow to properly protect individuals within an education institution, or
within other religious institutions:

Though it is certainly necessary and welcomed that _“content_ _by_ _or_ _for_ _an_


-----

##### sufficient to avoid the negative consequences the Bill s regime.

In the context of CET, the exclusion for educational institutions does not
##### appear to cover content containing views expressed by individuals within
the institution, or in the case of the Trustees of the Archdiocese of Hobart
(being the body that ultimately governs CET) statements made by the
##### Archbishop to members of the Catholic school community, and the
Tasmanian Catholic community more broadly. For example, it appears that
this exclusion would not cover statements made by priests or by the
##### Archbishop to parents and staff within the Tasmanian Catholic education
system.

Moreover, the Bill contains no general exclusion for information published
by a recognised religions in the exercise of faith.

This is contrasted with Anti-Discrimination legislation which, in all
jurisdictions in Australia (state and federal), contains limited exclusions for
religions, along with other legitimate exceptions around education,
employment, political groups, artistic expression and the like. There are
sound reasons why each of those areas is exempt from the application of
anti-discrimination laws, which are generally intended to balance freedom
##### of expression with protection of people from unlawful discrimination.

This will surely have a significant negative impact on the free expression of
religion, a freedom long recognised as a key tenet of Australian society.
The same can also be said in respect of political and artistic expression,
given there is no corresponding exclusion in the Bill. Digital service
providers will understandably seek to stifle and censor any such content to
the detriment of society as a whole.

(d) The definition of “harm” is both artificially narrow yet nebulous and open to
interpretation on the basis of value judgements by ACMA, in its proposed
role essentially monitoring the internet for “misinformation” and
##### “disinformation”:

Concerningly, under the Bill, what would be defined as being “harmful” is
left up to ACMA to determine.

This is problematic particularly given that the Bill defines misinformation as
##### content that is “.. .reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”6.
This requires value judgements as the definition is not limited to content
##### that in fact causes such harm. The Bill grants ACMA too broad a power to
make that value judgement as to what might cause harm.

(e) The concept of “disinformation” under the Bill will be essentially impossible
to enforce:

Under the Bill, “disinformation” is simply content that contains
##### “misinformation” that the “person disseminating, or causing the
_dissemination_ _of,_ _the_ _content_ _intends_ _that_ _the_ _content_ _deceive_ _another_
##### person.”7

There is no explanation in the Bill, Guidance Note, or Fact Sheet as to how
##### ACMA is intended to determine how a person disseminating content “intends” that it deceive another person. Reaching such a conclusion would
ordinarily require evidence to be provided from which the inference of the

5 The Bill, clause 2, definition of _“excluded_ _content_ _for_ _misinformation_ _purposes”,_ par (d)
6 The Bill, Clause 7(1 )(d)
7 The Bill, Clause 7(2)(e)


-----

so (or the service accused of not doing enough to prevent it) should be
entitled to answer the allegation and respond to the allegation How this is
intended to be achieved by ACMA is unclear.

**4** **Conclusion**

In consideration of all of the above, CET has specific and grave concerns about the
detrimental impact of the proposed Amendment.

We appreciate that the present intention in the Amendment is to provide exemptions
##### for educational organisations is commendable, however we must assert our view that
such exemptions need to be both necessary and enduring.

We believe that the proposed _Communications_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ is inimical to
religion in general and would impose unjust restrictions on the basic human right of
freedom of speech.

In addition to this, is the sure and certain risk that certain small but vocal minorities will
seek privileged status under such an Amendment, to the detriment of long-established
religious and educational institutions in Australia.

CET does not support the _Communications_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ as it presently
stands.

Yours Faithfully,
