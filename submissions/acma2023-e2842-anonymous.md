**REF:** **Communications** **Legislations** **Amendment** **(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023**

This letter outlines my strong objection to the above legislation (the Bill), as currently issued for public
consultation and outlined in the Department's Fact Sheet and Guidance Note, both dated June 2023. In
my assessment, the Bill is fundamentally flawed and an affront to the representative democratic
principles of Government, and should be scrapped in its entirety.

In brief, the Bill confers additional powers upon the Australian Communications & Media Authority
(ACMA) to combat harmful misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms. The standards to be
implemented by digital platforms through these powers are very loosely defined, highly subjective, open
to interpretation and subject to misuse and abuse with little, if any, accountability to the Australian
Parliament and to the Australia public.

The Bill places the onus on digital platform operators to determine what precisely is misinformation and
disinformation, and effectively empowers, and even requires, digital platforms to censor content that is

assessed by its operators to be misinformation or disinformation. And where the digital platforms
standards are deemed by ACMA to be insufficient, ACMA may demand the application of higher
standards. Given that ACMA is constituted as an independent Authority, these arrangements are
anathema to accountable Government, and an affront to a representative democracy.

Most critically, the Bill confers powers that may be applied in practice to limit freedom of speech, the
freedom of the press and the freedom of political expression. In contrast, all digital communications
issued by Commonwealth, State and Local Governments are excluded from the operation of this Bill,
irrespective of whether that communication is truthful, or is otherwise viewed as propaganda,
misinformation or disinformation. Virtually any digital communication that opposes or contradicts
Government communications may, in principle, be construed (correctly or otherwise) as misinformation
or disinformation, with the potential to shut down any (and all) political opposition to Government
pronouncements.

As an adolescent, in the era of the Vietnam War, I learned that Governments lie. And that lesson has
been frequently reinforced throughout my adult life. I have learned that Government communications
cannot be trusted. And I have learned that Governments (and Oppositions) are prone to misinform,
deceive, mislead and propagandize to shape public opinion for political ends. Accordingly, the potential
to misuse and/or abuse the powers under this Bill is entirely unacceptable.
