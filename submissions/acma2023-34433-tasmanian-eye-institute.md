**Re:** New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the
_Communications_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ _(Combatting_ _Misinformation_ _and_
_Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023)_

Dear Officer,

The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts **(the** **Department)** have invited feedback on an
exposure draft of the _Communications_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ _(Combatting_
_Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023_ **(the** **Bill).**

**INTRODUCTION** **-** **IN** **THE** **PURSUIT** **OF** **TRUTH**

There is a whimsical quote given by a Dean of Medicine to a graduating class of
doctors       - _“Half_ _of_ _what_ _we_ _taught_ _you_ _is_ _wrong,_ _the_ _problem_ _is_ _we_ _don’t_ _know_ _which_
_half!”._ The quote paraphrases Sir William Osler, considered the father of modern
Medicine, _“The_ _philosophies_ _of_ _one_ _age_ _have_ _become_ _the_ _absurdities_ _of_ _the_ _next,_
_and_ _the_ _foolishness_ _of_ _yesterday_ _has_ _become_ _the_ _wisdom_ _of_ _tomorrow.”_ Osler
provides another wise quote, relevant to the current matter of truth versus
misinformation/disinformation: _“No_ _human_ _being_ _is_ _constituted_ _to_ _know_ _the_ _truth,_ _the_
_whole_ _truth,_ _and_ _nothing_ _but_ _the_ _truth;_ _and_ _even_ _the_ _best_ _of_ _men_ _must_ _be_ _content_ _with_
_fragments,_ _with_ _partial_ _glimpses,_ _never_ _the_ _full_ _fruition.”_ German philosopher
Schopenhauer provided a more pessimistic perspective, but which perfectly
encapsulated ‘societal’ or ‘collective’ behaviour; _“All_ _truth_ _passes_ _through_ _three_
_stages._ _First,_ _it_ _is_ _ridiculed._ _Second,_ _it_ _is_ _violently_ _opposed._ _Third,_ _it_ _is_ _accepted_ _as_
_being_ _self-evident._ _”_

_\Ne_ have witnessed this ‘evolution of truth’ first hand through our pandemic response
in matters as diverse as covid-19 origins, benefits vs. harms of lockdowns and
masks, purported ‘safe and effective’ vaccines, and a variety of other ‘public health
interventions’ for some hypothesized ‘greater good’.
Our elected representatives have legislated exceptions that grant ‘powers’ by States
of Exception/Emergency (SOE):

             - exceptions to our democracy,

             - exceptions to the ethical practice of medicine,

             - exceptions to fundamental human rights.

My feedback on **the** **Bill** is as a Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology ^^^^who
has practiced as a registered Medical Practitioner for over 30 years and specialist
Ophthalmologist for more than 20 of those years. I have previously served as a
commissioned officer (Medical) in the and currently serve
my regional community of . I am a husband, father

and grandfather looking to ‘leave something behind’ of value in our ‘democracy’ for
‘our children’. As a clinician and academic who has years of conversations with
individuals across the breadth and depth of our society, over 100 peer-reviewed
scientific publications, along with interactions with ‘industry’ and the ‘systems’ we as
a society have either created or allowed to develop; I have witnessed the erosion our
foundations, not just of science and medicine, but our societal fabric and democratic
principles. Not in search of truth and progress, but a society infantilised for ‘comfort,
safety and protection’. As CS Lewis highlighted _“if_ _you_ _look_ _for_ _truth,_ _you_ _may_ _find_
_comfort_ _in_ _the_ _end;_ _if_ _you_ _look_ _for_ _comfort_ _you_ _will_ _not_ _get_ _either_ _comfort_ _or_ _truth_ _only_
_soft_ _soap_ _and_ _wishful_ _thinking_ _to_ _begin,_ _and_ _in_ _the_ _end,_ _despair._ _”_

Sir Isaac Newton, once said, _“If_ _I_ _have_ _seen_ _further,_ _it_ _is_ _by_ _standing_ _on_ _the_ _shoulders_
#### of giants.” In presenting my feedback to the Bill, I mention just a few of these giants
on whose shoulders I stand and why I consider any form of Mis/Disinformation Bill a
dangerous pursuit for our society, and one that takes our society down the path of
despair, and not something of value for us to leave behind.

Pursuit of truth is not a new concept as Professor (Dr) John loannidis has highlighted
in his 2005 publication **“Why** **Most** **Published** **Research** **Findings** **Are** **False”,** _‘A_
_pervasive_ _theme_ _of_ _ancient_ _Greek_ _literature_ _is_ _that_ _you_ _need_ _to_ _pursue_ _the_ _truth,_ _no_
_matter_ _what_ _the_ _truth_ _might_ _be’.'i_ Prof, loannidis has devoted his career to
challenging academia and bad science, as sadly doctors regularly are drawing on
misinformation in their everyday practice. My own academic and clinical pursuits
have also taken me down the path of the true sceptic distinguishing between true
science and ‘virtual or pseudo-science’ as Karl Popper describes in _“Conjectures_ _and_
_Refutations:_ _The_ _Growth_ _of_ _Scientific_ _Knowledge_ _(1963)”._ _\Ne_ think of the scientific
process as being objective, rigorous, and even ruthless in separating out what is true
from what we merely wish to be true, but in fact it’s easy to manipulate results, even
unintentionally or unconsciously. As Prof, loannidis described _“At_ _every_ _step_ _in_ _the_
_process,_ _there_ _is_ _room_ _to_ _distort_ _results,_ _a_ _way_ _to_ _make_ _a_ _stronger_ _claim_ _or_ _to_ _select_
_what_ _is_ _going_ _to_ _be_ _concluded._ _”_ _“There_ _is_ _an_ _intellectual_ _conflict_ _of_ _interest_ _that_
_pressures_ _researchers_ _to_ _find_ _whatever_ _it_ _is_ _that_ _is_ _most_ _likely_ _to_ _get_ _them_ _funded._ _”_

**The** **Bill** is doomed to fail in its objective of ensuring ‘truth’ as our ‘modern scientific
foundations’ are sadly riddled with misinformation; misinformation which our systems
(governments, organisations, experts, people) unhesitatingly rely upon and/or utilise
to suit their own purposes and whatever current narrative is being pursued. The
deliberate use of that misinformation by our existing systems (organisations,
‘experts’, key ‘opinion’ leaders) therefore already constitutes disinformation. The use
of pseudoscientific ‘fact-checkers’ (better termed fact chokers) further spreads that
disinformation, in the interests of the ‘narrative’. Mis- and dis-information not just
proposed but empowered for ‘select’ exempt bodies by **the** **Bill.** As has been
evident through our ‘pandemic response’, sadly the greatest objective source of mis-
and dis-information have been these very groups **the** **Bill** seeks to exempt
(government, main-stream media, and universities). For example, the World Health
Organisation frequently changed their recommendations with respect to several
aspects of pandemic management, due to the constantly changing nature of the

science and evidence. The State and Territory Governments were similarly turbulent
in their recommendations; many of which have subsequently proven to be incorrect.
If **the** **Bill** had been passed before the pandemic, thousands of Australians who
shared their opinions, often evidence based, on these recommendations could have
been found to have engaged in ‘misinformation’; despite later being vindicated as the
science and evidence properly emerged. This would be an unacceptable,
counterproductive and dangerous state of affairs.

_Good_ _scientists_ _fight_ _misinformation_ _by_ _doing_ _good_ _science._
_Tyrants_ _fight_ _misinformation_ _by_ _censoring_ _in_ _the_ _name_ _of_ _science._
_Pseudo-scientists_ _fight_ _misinformation_ _by_ _aiding_ _the_ _tyrants._

_The_ _solution_ _to_ _misinformation_ _is_ _providing_ _better_ _information._

The tyranny of censorship is the reputational destruction of critics of the powerful,
and the manufacture of false consensus by preventing other sides (truths) of a story
from being heard. My concerns are not speculative, Section 33 of the Bill
highlights ACMA can use technology to block me and trusted fact checkers to ‘judge’
my content.

The Tyranny of Censorship is that it first silences marginalised people. There are
two critical sides to democracy       - on the one hand majority rule, and on the other is
minority rights. The smallest minority in societies is the individual whose rights
seems to have been usurped by **this** **Bill.**

**HUMAN** **RIGHTS** **SHOULD** **BE** **PROTECTED** **BY** **THE** **RULE** **OF** **LAW** **(UN,** **1948)**

**_“It_** **_Is_** **_essential,_** **_if_** **_man_** **_is_** **_not_** **_to_** **_be_** **_compelled_** **_to_** **_have_** **_recourse,_** **_as_** **_a_** **_last_** **_resort,_**
**_to_** **_rebellion_** **_against_** **_tyranny_** **_and_** **_oppression,_** **_that_** **_human_** **_rights_** **_should_** **_be_**
**_protected_** **_by_** **_the_** **_Rule_** **_of_** **_Law._** **_—_** **_United_** **_Nations_** **_Universal_** **_Declaration_** **_of_**
**_Human_** **_Rights,_** **_1948"_**

I would like to examine those human rights, my rights, all of our individual rights; as
**the** **Bill** as presented (and probably in any form) **would** **render** **Australia’s**
**commitment** **to** **freedom** **of** **speech** **and** **expression** **(fundamental**
**internationally** **recognised** **human** **rights)** **meaningless.**

**The** **Bill** is not just about censorship of speech, but more disturbingly censorship of
reach (as the mechanism by which to limit Freedom of speech). Ultimately **the** **Bill**
is about criminalising dissent in the name of mis- and dis-information.
Criminalisation of dissent that already exists for doctors with legislation passed in
October 2022 in Queensland, the _‘Health_ _Practitioner_ _Regulation_ _National_ _Law_ _and_
_Other_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ _Bill_ _2022’,_ and agreed to be adopted in other
jurisdictions.

Australia is a party to seven core international human rights treaties, which in turn
are based upon principles of Natural Law and Democracy espoused by philosophers
for Millenia. Mostly relevantly to **this** **Bill** is Australia being a signatory to the
_International_ _Covenant_ _on_ _Civil_ _and_ _Political_ _Rights_ **(ICCPR).**


-----

**_Article_** **_1_** **_of_** **_the_** **_ICCPR_** **_-_** **_Right_** **_to_** **_Self-Determination_**

_1._ _All_ _peoples_ _have_ _the_ _right_ _of_ _self-determination._ _By_ _virtue_ _of_ _that_ _right_ _they_ _freely_
_determine_ _their_ _political_ _status_ _and_ _freely_ _pursue_ _their_ _economic,_ _social_ _and_ _cultural_
_development._

My right to “Social and cultural development” necessarily includes the interaction
with, and sharing of, ideas online/digitally including by websites and social media
platforms. **The** **Bill** has not adequately identified how it will not impede my right to
self-determination. In particular censorship of reach (via digital platforms) as
proposed in **the** **Bill.**

**_Article_** **_18_** **_of_** **_the_** **_ICCPR_** **_-_** **_Freedom_** **_of_** **_Thought,_** **_Conscience_** **_and_** **_Religion_**

_1._ _Everyone_ _shall_ _have_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _freedom_ _of_ _thought,_ _conscience_ _and_ _religion._ _This_
_right_ _shall_ _include_ _freedom_ _to_ _have_ _or_ _to_ _adopt_ _a_ _religion_ _or_ _belief_ _of_ _his_ _choice,_ _and_
_freedom,_ _either_ _individually_ _or_ _in_ _community_ _with_ _others_ _and_ _in_ _public_ _or_ _private_ _to_
_manifest_ _his_ _religion_ _or_ _belief_ _in_ _worship,_ _observance,_ _practice_ _and_ _teaching._

The Bill as proposed (and likely in any ‘censorship’ form) threatens my right to
freedom of thought which includes **the** **freedom** **to** **express** **my** **thoughts,** and
freedom of conscience which includes **the** **right** **to** **have** **access** **to** **a** **broad** **range**
**of** **information** **which** **might** **inform** **my** **conscience.** As the drafters and
signatories of ICCPR recognised, even existential threats as defined under its Article
4 do not apply to my rights under article 18, such is its import.

**_Article_** **_19_** **_of_** **_the_** **_ICCPR_** **_-_** **_Freedom_** **_of_** **_Expression_**

_1._ _Everyone_ _shall_ _have_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _hold_ _opinions_ _without_ _interference._

_2._ _Everyone_ _shall_ _have_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _freedom_ _of_ _expression;_ _this_ _right_ _shall_ _include_
_freedom_ _to_ _seek,_ _receive_ _and_ _impart_ _information_ _and_ _ideas_ _of_ _all_ _kinds,_ _regardless_ _of_
_frontiers,_ _either_ _orally,_ _in_ _writing_ _or_ _in_ _print,_ _in_ _the_ _form_ _of_ _art,_ _or_ _through_ _any_ _other_
_media_ _of_ _his_ _choice._
_3._ _The_ _exercise_ _of_ _the_ _rights_ _provided_ _for_ _in_ _paragraph_ _2_ _of_ _this_ _article_ _carries_ _with_ _it_
_special_ _duties_ _and_ _responsibilities._ _It_ _may_ _therefore_ _be_ _subject_ _to_ _certain_ _restrictions,_
_but_ _these_ _shall_ _only_ _be_ _such_ _as_ _are_ _provided_ _by_ _law_ _and_ _are_ **_necessary:_**
_(a)_ _For_ _respect_ _of_ _the_ _rights_ _or_ _reputations_ _of_ _others;_
_(b)_ _For_ _the_ _protection_ _of_ _national_ _security_ _or_ _of_ _public_ _order_ _(ordre_ _public),_ _or_ _of_ _public_
_health_ _or_ _morals._

My right to Freedom of expression would be jeopardized by **this** **Bill** and **the** **Bill** as
presented does not adequately define the ‘necessity’ for me to be subject to these
restrictions or the ‘harm’ that might eventuate if the ACMA restrictions proposed in
**the** **Bill** to ‘protect’ did not exist. I have emphasized necessary in Article 19 of the
ICCPR above as this high bar _(Neccesitas_ _legum_ _non_ _habet_      - Necessity has no law)
**requires** that **this** **Bill** and the powers granted to ACMA have been identified as
**‘absolutely** **essential’** for the protection of national security, public order, public
health or morals. **The** **Bill** and accompanying information has not defined what the
specific nature of ‘the problem’ is, the harms demonstrated to have arisen from that
‘problem’, that no alternative (less onerous) solutions under current legislation exist,
nor exactly how the proposed Bill actually solves ‘the problem’.


-----

Under the provisions of _the_ _Australian_ _Human_ _Rights_ _Commission_ _Act_ _1986_
_(Commonwealth)_ the Australian Human Rights Commission **(AHRC)** would have a
statutory obligation to examine **the** **Bill** to ensure that my human rights (such as
freedom of expression) would not be affected by **the** **Bill** if passed. I will most
definitely be making a complaint to AHRC should **this** **Bill** be passed.

Under the provisions of the _Human_ _Rights_ _(Parliamentary_ _Scrutiny)_ _Act_ _2011_ I have
not seen a publicly released Statement of Compatibility, assessing the compatibility
of the proposed legislation with the rights and freedoms recognised in the seven,
core international human rights treaties that Australia has ratified, including the
ICCPR. It is particularly concerning that **the** **Bill** proposes illusory protections of my
‘freedom of political communication’ as ACMA is defined as the sole arbiter of
‘misinformation standards’ and must only ‘consider’ based on ‘any circumstances it
considers relevant’ whether my freedoms have been reasonably curtailed.
Problematically **the** **Bill** only invites me retrospective correction via litigation, rather
than ensuring ACMA pays appropriate mind to my human rights in the first place.

**The** **Fact** **sheet** **accompanying** **the** **Bill** states _“misinformation_ _and_ _disinformation_
_pose_ _a_ _threat_ _to_ _the_ _safety_ _and_ _wellbeing_ _of_ _Australians,_ _as_ _well_ _as_ _our_ _democracy,_
_society_ _and_ _economy”._ The accompanying **Guidance** **Note** **to** **the** **Bill** states _“The_
_proposed_ _powers_ _seek_ _to_ _strike_ _a_ _balance_ _between_ _the_ _public_ _interest_ _in_ _combatting_
_the_ _serious_ _harms_ _that_ _can_ _arise_ _from_ _the_ _propagation_ _of_ _misinformation_ _and_
_disinformation,_ _with_ _freedom_ _of_ _speech.”_

The mechanism of **the** **Bill** and implementation of ACMA’s powers will be systemic
(presumably algorithmic/rules based) rather than individually focussed       - this is in
itself misleading double-speak as it is effecting silence of (individual) speech via
silence of (systemic) reach. Ultimately the powers granted ACMA by **this** **Bill**
Criminalise dissent from whatever ‘consensus’ authority position is held and most
certainly do not contain sufficient protections for individuals lawfully exercising their
**fundamental** **human** **right** **to** **Self-determination,** **Freedom** **of** **expression,** **and**
**Freedom** **of** **thought** **and** **conscience** **and** **religion.**

Of final legal concern are the quasi-judicial powers that **Division** **3** **of** **the** **Bill,**
innocuously titled _“Information_ _gathering”_ grants to ACMA. Even the protections
available to defendants in the criminal charge and hearing process are not afforded
to digital platform providers (which again, can be individuals) under **this** **Bill.** The
provision of this unbounded quasi-judicial authority subverts the rule of law and
common law rights, while granting to ACMA a star chamber-like authority not
afforded under the Constitution.

**The** **Bill** defines misinformation and disinformation as “false, misleading or deceptive
content” that may cause ‘harm’. None of these terms however are defined in **the**
**Bill.** **The** **Bill** is disingenuous in its attempt to state an affinity for my freedom of
speech and expression, instead offering several mechanisms for how my rights can
be curtailed by ACMA. The uncertainty this creates would almost certainly result in
my censorship by digital platforms out of caution in an effort to avoid potential
liability. My fundamental rights cannot be overridden by undefined, general or
ambiguous words as are contained within **this** **Bill.**


-----

**Human** **rights** **are** **acknowledged** **by** **Government,** **not** **granted** **or** **removed.**

### “SOVEREIGN IS HE WHO DECIDES ON THE EXCEPTION” (Schmidt)

**The** **Bill** is one of the most concerning and dangerous pieces of legislations I have
seen proposed. Not just because **The** **Bill** would allow the Australian
Communications and Media Authority **(ACMA)** substantial, unilateral and
discretionary authority to govern all forms of media. More insidiously, because of the
powers granted to those explicitly excepted from **the** **Bill’s** operation. Should the
Bill or a revised iteration of it be passed, then it will join existing manifestly
dangerous legislation that already suspends democracy and fundamental human
rights under states of exception/emergency, such as our various Public Health Acts
and Biosecurity Acts.

**The** **Bill** authorises and therefore empowers (by exemption) certain parties/bodies to
mis-inform or dis-inform. Under **the** **Bill** Government, Mainstream Media and
Universities can lie, while a truth-teller by holding a dissenting opinion to the ‘arbiters
of truth’ can be criminalised.

Foucault taught that _“power_ _determines_ _everything,_ _truth_ _is_ _simply_ _an_ _expression_ _of_
_power_ _and_ _knowledge_ _is_ _neither_ _true_ _nor_ _false_ _but_ _instead_ _is_ _made_ _legitimate_ _or_
_illegitimate_ _by_ _established_ _power1’._ This means whenever a power is granted,
inevitably it will be abused. As CS Lewis wrote, it is _“the_ _magician’s_ _bargain:_ _give_ _up_
_our_ _soul,_ _get_ _power_ _in_ _return._ _But_ _once_ _our_ _souls,_ _that_ _is,_ _ourselves,_ _have_ _been_ _given_
_up,_ _the_ _power_ _thus_ _conferred_ _will_ _not_ _belong_ _to_ _us._ _We_ _shall_ _in_ _fact_ _be_ _the_ _slaves_ _and_
_puppets_ _of_ _that_ _to_ _which_ _we_ _have_ _given_ _our_ _souls.”_

These are not hypothetical matters. Already AHPRA has been granted
unprecedented powers by the _‘Health_ _Practitioner_ _Regulation_ _National_ _Law_ _and_
_Other_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ _Bill_ 2022’(Doctor **Gag** **Bill)** to coercively silence
doctors who stray from the officially mandated public health ‘narrative’ even if the
doctor ‘speaks evidence-based truths’. Just as with **this** **mis-** **and** **dis-information**
**Bill,** the explanatory notes to the **Doctor** **Gag** **Bill** state the regulatory body will be
free to take action against a doctor or health practitioner in any way they deem
‘necessary or convenient’ to ‘safeguard’ public confidence and safety.

_“Speaking_ _truth_ _to_ _power_ _is_ _emotionally_ _demanding”2_ let alone practically
meaningless because power is law, and law is decisionist: “this time is different”;
difference being the very nature of exception!

_“The_ _exercise_ _and_ _enjoyment_ _of_ _power_ _is_ _rarely_ _conducive_ _to_ _speaking_ _the_ _truth;_
_rather_ _the_ _reverse.”_ (Foucault)

**Telling** **thoughtful** **truths** **should** **not** **be** **a** **revolutionary** **act.** **Speaking** **truths** **to**
**power** **should** **not** **be** **sacrificial.**

**‘WE** **_LEARN_** **_FROM_** **_HISTORY_** **_THAT_** **_WE_** **_DO_** **_NOT_** **_LEARN_** **_FROM_** **_HISTORY"_**
**(Hegel).**

This lesson has become increasingly apparent over my academic and medical
career and observations of the changes in our societal fabric       - meaning the ignorant
will be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Accusations of misinformation/disinformation is exactly what Socrates was
sentenced to death for. As recounted by Plato:

_“Me_ _you_ _have_ _killed_ _because_ _you_ _wanted_ _to_ _escape_ _the_ _accuser,_ _and_ _not_ _to_
_give_ _an_ _account_ _of_ _your_ _lives._ _But_ _that_ _will_ _not_ _be_ _as_ _you_ _suppose:_ _far_
_othenvise._ _For_ _I_ _say_ _that_ _there_ _will_ _be_ _more_ _accusers_ _of_ _you_ _than_ _there_ _are_
_now;_ _accusers_ _whom_ _hitherto_ _I_ _have_ _restrained:_ _and_ _as_ _they_ _are_ _younger_ _they_
_will_ _be_ _more_ _severe_ _with_ _you,_ _and_ _you_ _will_ _be_ _more_ _offended_ _at_ _them._
_For_ _if_ _you_ _think_ _that_ _by_ _killing_ _men_ _you_ _can_ _avoid_ _the_ _accuser_ _censuring_ _your_
_lives,_ _you_ _are_ _mistaken;_ _that_ _is_ _not_ _a_ _way_ _of_ _escape_ _which_ _is_ _either_ _possible_ _or_
_honorable;_ _the_ _easiest_ _and_ _noblest_ _way_ _is_ _not_ _to_ _be_ _crushing_ _others,_ _but_ _to_ _be_
_improving_ _yourselves._ _This_ _is_ _the_ _prophecy_ _which_ _I_ _utter_ _before_ _my_ _departure,_
_to_ _the_ _judges_ _who_ _have_ _condemned_ _me._

## - Plato’s The Apology”

Socrates defends himself well, against the accusation of misinformation (corruptor of
the youth). Socrates rightly identifies that he is hated by certain men not because he
corrupts, but because they are afraid he will cause them to face their own errors and
fallacies (i.e. those governing). Socrates also prophesizes that to crush dissenting
opinions, as they are attempting to do with Socrates, will not make your problems go
away, but will instead multiply and cause them to become more severe. The fate of
such a society?       - history confirms, chaos and tyranny and the inevitable destruction
of that democracy. Some centuries later Cicero reminds us again with the same
message of power and censorship, again warning of the decline of democracy into
chaos and tyranny under Mark Antony.

Again, only a few centuries later St Augustine of Hippo underscored that there is no
need for censorship to protect truth, _“The_ _truth_ _is_ _like_ _a_ _lion;_ _you_ _don’t_ _have_ _to_ _defend_
_it._ _Let_ _it_ _loose;_ _it_ _will_ _defend_ _itself._ _”_

US President Harry Truman bringing us to modern politics emphasised, _“Once_ _a_
_government_ _is_ _committed_ _to_ _the_ _principle_ _of_ _silencing_ _the_ _voice_ _of_ _opposition,_ _it_ _has_
_only_ _one_ _place_ _to_ _go,_ _and_ _that_ _is_ _down_ _the_ _path_ _of_ _increasingly_ _repressive_ _measures,_
_until_ _it_ _becomes_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _terror_ _to_ _all_ _of_ _its_ _citizens_ _and_ _creates_ _a_ _country_ _where_
_everyone_ _lives_ _in_ _fear”._

When the public is no longer the arbiter of truth, and that role becomes usurped by
bureaucrats and governments, history suggests that the resultant censorship erodes
the public's collective trust in authority. As Socrates, Plato and Cicero so plainly
described and which history has repeatedly demonstrated, censorship signals the
downward spiral of democracy      - down this path leads the death of democracy and
totalitarianism.


-----

Political theorist Eric Voegelin, who studied the totalitarian regimes of the 20th
Century, noted that the common feature of all totalitarian systems is the _prohibition_ _of_
_questions._ These regimes begin by monopolizing what counts as rationality        - what
counts as acceptable public knowledge       - and then place any dissidents outside the
pale of rational conversation. Surveillance of dissident thoughts and behaviours and
censorship of dissenting opinions then expand together. People in authority lie and
our job in a democracy is to remain sceptical. _“The_ _truth_ _is_ _never_ _decided_ _by_
_majorities”_ (Hitchens).

**Trusting** **experts** **is** **not** **a** **feature** **of** **science,** **and** **it's** **not** **a** **feature** **of**
**democracy.** **It's** **a** **feature** **of** **religion** **and** **totalitarianism.**

Until Copernicus confirmed the sun as centre of the solar system, 99.9% of the world
considered the earth was the centre of the universe. Galileo embraced Copernicus’
knowledge stating       - _“all_ _truths_ _are_ _easy_ _to_ _understand_ _once_ _they_ _are_ _discovered,_ _the_
_point_ _is_ _to_ _discover_ _them.”_ Galileo was sentenced by the church (prevailing power)
to abandon his ideas (dissent) and was imprisoned until his death. In a speech to
English Parliament in 1644 Poet John Milton, arguing against censorship
commented _“There_ _it_ _was_ _that_ _I_ _found_ _and_ _visited_ _the_ _famous_ _Galileo_ _grown_ _old,_ _a_
_prisoner_ _to_ _the_ _Inquisition,_ _for_ _thinking_ _in_ _Astronomy_ _otherwise_ _than_ _the_ _Franciscan_
_and_ _Dominican_ _licencers_ _thought.”_ Just as in Galilean and then Newton’s
progression of our understanding of physics and motion; friction is an essential
element of all human experience. It is through friction of speech and thought that
progress is made.

As Prof. John loannidis has warned, science has become our newest religion (‘trust
the experts’       - whether that be public health, climate, educational/academic). Science
is never proved by consensus          - in fact as Popper best describes, nothing can ever
be proven by science       - only prevailing theories disproved.

Finally, three modern warnings about the dangers of ‘arbiters of truth’.

           - It is less than 100 years since frontal lobotomy was first performed (1935).
Ashamedly, ‘scientific consensus’ led this procedure to be awarded the Nobel
Prize in Medicine in 1949.

           - Few people would be aware of the Cutter polio vaccine disaster.3 _‘The_
_disease_ _caused_ _by_ _Cutter’s_ _vaccine_ _was_ _worse_ _than_ _the_ _disease_ _caused_ _by_
_natural_ _polio’,_ in the end at least 220,000 were infected, 70,000 developed
paralysis (75% for life), 164 severely and 10 died. This travesty, in the
interests of ‘public health’ good was covered up (censored i.e dis-information)
for more than 50 years because ‘the public should be spared the ordeal of
“knowledge about controversy". Dare it undermine confidence in public health
(where else have we heard that? Doctor Gag Bill).

           - Lastly in my own field of Ophthalmology. The story of Harold Ridley inventor
of the intraocular lens for cataract surgery.4 Ridley an insightful brilliant eye
surgeon recognised that Perspex in eyes of injured World War 2 pilots was
inert. Subsequently in 1949 (the same year frontal lobotomy is awarded a
Nobel Prize), Ridley performs a revolutionary operation in secret, implanting a
new device, the intraocular lens, which replaces the cloudy cataract. Word
leaks out two years later, and **the** **world’s** **most** **prominent** **ophthalmologist**
**(Sir** **Duke-Elder)** **vilifies** **and** **ostracizes** **Ridley.** Ridley suffers from
depression, an outcast in his profession. Ralph Nader and Sydney Wolfe
petition the FDA to outlaw the lens. It took over 40 years for Ridley’s truth to
be ‘self-evident’ and the intraocular lens and Ridley to be accepted. Ridley’s
truth in the face of prevailing ‘expert arbiters of truth’ _“changed_ _the_ _world_ _so_
_that_ _we_ _might_ _better_ _see_ _it”.5_ Millions of patients around the globe have
regained their vision from the intraocular lens. Truth came at a great price for
Sir Harold Ridley, thankfully recognised at 93 years of age, when knighted by
Queen Elizabeth.

‘Arbiter of truth’ processes are not benign, as 16 doctors in just 4 years have sadly
experienced when subjected to AHPRA notification, _“‘Deeply_ _confronting’_ _findings_
_show_ _acute_ _distress_ _of_ _AHPRA_ _notifications”_ _with_ 16 suicides among practitioners
facing regulatory scrutiny.6

‘Arbiters of truth’ by ‘consensus’ in any thought or speech is dangerous and returns
our society to Spanish inquisition days but with far wider implications for maintaining
a position in society given our interconnectedness digitally. That is why censorship
in any form and **this** **Bill** in particular is so concerning to me. Existing State of
Exception/Emergency legislation has already progressed well down the path of
unchecked human rights abuses under the guise of Medicine and in the name of
‘safety’ (eg Doctor Gag Bill, Public Health Acts, Biosecurity Act). Doctors already are
left in the impossible position of needing to hold the primacy of the patient’s right to
autonomy and informed consent but not when this scientific evidence deviates from
the position stated by Public Health even when Public Health is demonstrably and
manifestly wrong. **This** **Bill** if passed will join many others that have granted
inappropriate and unchecked powers to unelected bodies capable of imposing
regulatory frameworks that haven’t even been created yet, and not subject to
meaningful challenge.

I Fundamentally and vehemently oppose **this** **Bill.** If such legislation is allowed to
pass, it will not only signal the death knell of the internet as a free marketplace of
ideas in Australia, but it will signal to Australian citizens, and to citizens of the globe,
that the Australian Government seeks total control of the dissemination of
information within its borders, and that such control is more valuable to that
Government than the individual rights of its citizenry. That would be a dark day for
democracy indeed, were such a thing to pass.

On current construction, if **the** **Bill** is passed, ACMA could create and then enforce
rules, codes and standards that contain anything ACMA wants; without oversight,
and without the ability for users of digital platforms, or those platforms themselves, to
question or challenge those rules. The provision of this arbitrary rule making
authority subverts representative democracy while granting ACMA a head of power
not found under the Constitution. Just as has iccurred through the pandemic with
the abuse of powers by our public health officers (at the willing supercilious
encouragement of various governments) the additional power that **the** **Bill** grants
ACMA to “determine standards [in] emerging circumstances”; that is, that ACMA only
needs t( consider it “necessary **or** **convenient”** (emphasis added) to create
standards “in order to provide adequate protection for the community from
misinformation or disinformation n the services”. The use of the word “convenient”
betrays the intent of the drafters; the discretion offered to ACMA is designed to be as
broad, and as difficult to challenge, as possible. Just as challenging public health
orders including mandates have proven. Our pandemic response exercised through
administrative powers granted to unelected bodies and persons, totally trashed
medical ethics and fundamental human rights and our courts willingly obliged the
administrative response to the manifest detriment of our society. The challenge for
our democracy is not that these states of exception/emergency have been (or will
be) misapplied ‘on this occasion’, but that states of exception for our democracy are
an abuse of fundamental human rights on any occasion. These abuses are only
remedied by their aboliti n.

**This** **Bill** **should** **be** **abandoned.** Existing State of exception/emergency legislation
(eg Public Health Acts, Doctor Gag Bill) should be amended to abolish those powers
that breach fundamental human rights to which Australia is a signatory. Otherwise,
our democracy truly is meaningless. Sadly the vocation of Medicine is rapidly
becoming so.
