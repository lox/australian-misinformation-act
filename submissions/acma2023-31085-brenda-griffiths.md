Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting


Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


Dear Sir/Madam,


I am writing to express my extreme anger and outrage at the proposed


Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and


Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I believe that this bill clearly


demonstrates the government's lack of respect for the freedom of speech rights of


its citizens.


This bill creates a two-tiered system, where politicians, journalists, and members of


educational institutions are granted the power to spread information, regardless of


its accuracy, while regular citizens are burdened with excessive fines and restrictions


on their speech. This is a direct attack on the democratic principles and the power


of the internet to give a voice to ordinary people.


The bill fails to recognize the impossibility of accurately judging what is true or false.


Why should we trust this sneaky government to determine what is true and what is


false? To determine which news and opinion is allowed to be published, and which


should be banned to ‘protect public health and safety’?


New information is constantly emerging, often contradicting what was once widely


accepted as fact. It is unfair to penalize individuals or platforms for sharing


information that was considered true at the time. The potential for fines and removal


of content under this bill is extremely concerning.


Additionally, the bill's reliance on industry bodies and codes is deeply flawed. These


bodies are often influenced by the largest players in the industry, making it likely that


the regulations imposed will be anti-competitive and detrimental to smaller digital


services. The bill gives undue power to the largest platforms, allowing them to


damage their smaller competitors and stifle free market competition.


-----

It is important to recognize that the free market has shown evidence of working in


combating misinformation and disinformation. Users naturally migrate away from


platforms with lax policies and enforcement in favor of those that fulfill community


expectations. This bill undermines this natural competition and innovation in the


digital space.


Moreover, the proposed extraterritorial reach of this bill is unreasonable and


counterproductive. It places an undue burden on foreign entities and platforms,


many of whom may have no knowledge of Australian law or industry codes. It is


absurd to expect global compliance with a law that applies to every digital


platform, regardless of their familiarity or involvement with Australian law.


This bill also undermines the freedom of political communication and diversity of


viewpoints. By designating certain political party viewpoints as misinformation, the

bill effectively silences opposition, limiting citizens' access to information necessary


for informed voting decisions. This goes against the principles of democracy and


citizens' right to access information.


Furthermore, the threats and interference posed by this bill to digital platform


providers and ordinary users are unacceptable. The potential for reputational


damage, financial penalties, and invasion of privacy is deeply concerning. It creates


an environment of fear and censorship, discouraging open and honest dialogue.


We are already seeing this with the Voice Referendum as Prime Minister Anthony

_Albanese can be seen to link the growing international wave of misinformation to_

_the campaign against the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, saying he is optimistic_


_Australians will look past a confected culture war and support the referendum._


So on one hand, Labor says stopping misinformation is about ‘keeping Australians


safe online’. On the other hand, the Prime Minister says misinformation is people who


don’t agree with his divisive proposal to embed a new bureaucracy in our


Constitution.


-----

For left-wing governments and commentators, ‘misinformation’ has become the


new ‘hate speech’ – terms used by the left to justify legal punishment against any


opposing views.


There are many red flags raised by this Bill. Perhaps the biggest is the fact that


Albanese has exempted anything from his own government or the media from


being considered ‘misinformation’. Yet anything said in response to the government


by the Opposition or another political party, or by any member of the public, can be


considered misinformation and censored. This is a total double standard.


In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Communications Legislation Amendment

(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is an unreasonable and

unjust restriction on freedom of speech and enterprise. It fails to address the

complexities of determining truth and misinformation, stifles competition, and

disregards the principles of democracy.

I urge you to reconsider this bill and prioritize the protection of freedom of speech

and the democratic principles that Australia holds dear.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Brenda Griffiths
