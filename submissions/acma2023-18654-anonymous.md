# Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023

## Introduction

It is rare for me to make comment or provide feedback on a proposed bill to parliament.
However, what the Albanese Government is proposing is the most significant attempt by an
Australian Government to suppress free Speech online in this country. It must not be
allowed to be passed

Currently average Australians have little opportunity to make their concerns and or views
heard other than on an online platform. without restrictions until now.. This has enabled
online debate even if these views are not always those of others on the digital platform. This
is healthy

## The Draft Bill

This draconian bill seeks to place unprecedented power and authority into the hands of a
group of unelected public servants within the Canberra based government bureaucracy “the
ACMA”.to determine what is true and what is false. What is “misinformation and what is
disinformation.

The authority vested in the ACMA seeks to preside over what they will determine is the truth
of the widest range of information placed on digital platforms ranging but not limited to race,
religion, sex, gender and the environment.

Through this proposed bill the government will have the power to control what an individual
or a digital media platform provider may say online.

The draft bill proposed under the guise of keeping Australians safe will inhibit free speech. It
will do so by using the authority requested in this bill by the ACMA by extending authoritarian
government overreach on everyday Australians to voice concern or opinion on line. The
ACMA seeks to have the power to impose substantial fines or even imprisonment on an
dividual or platform operator that it decides does not comply with its self-determined rules.

The ACMA has produced a wordy 60 page legalistic document supporting the proposed bill
listed as an exposure draft of A Bill for an Act to amend the law relating to Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023._

This document is full of legal boilerplate, complex in its wording and multiple cross
references

Below the ACMA defines Misinformation and Disinformation in their terms and what it wants
as its authority to .“draw on its reserve powers to register enforceable industry”

**7 Misinformafion and disinformafion (Direct extracfion from the draft)**

_(1)_ _For the purposes of this Schedule, disseminafion of content using a_
_digital service is misinformafion on the digital service if:_
_(a) the content contains informafion that is false, misleading or 8 decepfive; and 9_
_(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformafion 10 purposes; and 11_
_(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more 12 end-users in Australia; and_
_13_
_(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is 14 reasonably likely to cause or_
_contribute to serious harm._


-----

_(2)  For the purposes of this Schedule, disseminafion of content using a 16 digital service is_
**_disinformafion on the digital service if: 17_**
_(a) the content contains informafion that is false, misleading or 18 decepfive;_
_(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformafion 20 purposes; and 21_
_(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more 22 end-users in Australia; a_
_(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is 24 reasonably likely to cause or_
_contribute to serious harm; and 25_
_(e) the person disseminafing, or causing the disseminafion of, the 26 content intends that the_
_content deceive another person. 27 Note: Disinformafion includes disinformafion by or on_
_behalf of a foreign_

Referencing the above extracts

**_item a) for both cases_**

The following questions must be answered

a. How can a team within the ACMA make an absolute determination on what is false
misleading or deceptive?

b. On what grounds
c. Who can contest such determination? These are unelected public servants.
d. Who will be the arbitrator of an ACMA determination?

**_Item d) for both cases_**

The ACMA has the power to determine what could reasonably cause harm. When reviewing
what is listed as harm(see below) It is a list so broad it is easy to imagine for any online
statement that the ACMA / government doesn’t agree with, a case could be conveniently
mounted for and determined as harm under one of the multiple listed interpretations below.

In schedule 1 harm is **declared as:**

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of 9 ethnicity, nafionality, race, gender,
sexual orientafion, age, 10 religion or physical or mental disability; 11

(b) disrupfion of public order or society in Australia; 1

(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democrafic processes or of 13 Commonwealth, State, Territory
or local government 14 insfitufions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians; 16

(e) harm to the Australian environment; 17 (f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the
Australian 18 economy or a sector of the Australian economy

**Item e**

Here the ACMA wants the power to determine that the Disinformation content is intended to
deceive another person.

Without a doubt item( e) provides the ACMA /government the widest scope to create their
own view on what the original creator has intended.


-----

Hoe can the ACMA make any absolute determination on what an individual intended? This is
unbelievable power in the hands of such a government department

The questions listed above under item a d and e begs the question to the government on
what censorship model is it planning to adopt as it smacks of the sort of media suppression
imposed in Russia and China.

**Division 2 of the document addresses Record keeping and reporting by the Digital**
platform providers.

It is unclear how well advanced the ACMA has progressed on the rules to be imposed on the
platform providers as there is continual use of the word “may”

What is clear is that the ACMA intends to enforce rules on platform providers

“ACMA will be equipped with new information-gathering and record-keeping powers to
_oversee digital platform providers, and will hold these online service providers responsible_
_for the accuracy of information and their response to disinformation on their services._

**Record keeping and reporfing**

2 14 ACMA may make digital plafform rules in relafion to records 3 Records 4 (1) The digital plafform
rules may require a digital plafform provider 5 of: 6 (a) a digital plafform service specified in the
rules; or 7 (b) a digital plafform service in a class of digital plafform 8 services specified in the rules; 9
to make and retain records relafing to the following: 10 (c) misinformafion or disinformafion on the
service; 11 (d) measures implemented by the provider to prevent or respond 12 to misinformafion or
disinformafion on the service, including 13 the effecfiveness of the measures; 14 (e) the prevalence
of content containing false, misleading or 15 decepfive informafion provided on the service (other
than 16 excluded content for misinformafion purposes)..

**Registrafion of misinformafion codes**

The ACMA states that it may introduce Misinformation codes.I do not intend to comment on
this as the wording in the document is confusing and unclear.

What is important is that the rules imposed on the content providers do not cause
unintentional gagging of the users due to holding the providers responsible for what is true or
what is false. What is an opinion? Providers may refuse content as they cannot be sure if a
statement is an opinion or fact.

the provider may be forced to shut down content rather than face yet to be disclosed fines.
This is censorship.

## In conclusion

The Disinformation Misinformation bill is a major overreach by “big government” and is
against democracy in Australia

It has major consequences on the freedom of speech of all online users in Australia.

The proposed power within the Misinformation Disinformation bill to be given to an
unelected team of public servants under the control of the Albanese government is an
unprecedented attempt at online censorship .


-----

If passed this will be the most deliberate act of censorship by any western government. .

The timing of this bill is so transparent and cannot be ignored as it is within just months prior
to one of the most important Referendums in Australia’s history.

This can only be interpreted as an act of desperation by the Albanese government to
silence online opposition to the Government’s plan to change the Australian constitution to
include an indigenous voice to parliament.’

This bill must be rejected
