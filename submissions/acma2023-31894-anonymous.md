**Dystopian Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Like most Australians who are blessed with a smidgen of common sense, I vehemently oppose this piece of rubbish
legislation amendment bill.

What is the meaning of misinformation and disinformation? How does one interpret information that one receives?
Every person has a set of values and frameworks based upon past experiential, educational and environmental factors
by which they process, understand and interpret information put before them. What is one person’s understanding
and interpretation as truth will no doubt prove to be another person’s falsehood. How can anyone negate another’s
opinion and interpretation/understanding? No-one has the right to do that.

Just because there is disagreement about issues does not give anyone the right to shut down the opposing viewpoint
and prevent people from deciding for themselves what information is their truth and their falsehood. This is dystopian
in nature and heading into very dangerous territory.

Take, for example, the COVID narrative. In 2020, when COVID narratives purporting that vaccines were “safe and
effective” and were being shoved down people’s throats, those who stood up against that narrative were blasphemed,
ridiculed and criticised for spreading conspiracy, misinformation, disinformation theories.

Now in 2023, we find that there have been hundreds of thousands of people around the world who have been
permanently harmed and physically disabled, let alone those who have died from vaccine injury (sudden death
syndrome) by following that vaccine narrative being forced upon them. The vaccines were ALWAYS an EXPERIMENTAL
medical procedure.

The narrative that “safe and effective vaccines” in 2020 was touted by the general ‘powers that be’ as the ONLY truth
and anything contrary to this information was misinformation/disinformation and scorned as conspiracy. Yet three
years later we find that the ‘accepted narrative of 2020’ was NOT the truth – the truth has been clearly demonstrated
that vaccines were “not safe and effective” and the real CONSPIRACY was that they were. History has proven beyond
a shadow of a doubt that now in 2023 the vaccines were NEVER safe and they were NEVER effective. The vaccines did
not stop people getting COVID, as purported, and they certainly were not safe to those who died or were permanently
injured from them.

Just because information is not the ‘government’ accepted narrative as truth at one point in time, the information
could prove to be the truth at a time further into the future. Take for example, the accepted theory at a point back in
history where the world was flat. At that time, because the truth had not been exposed this concept of a ‘flat world’
was truth. Yet, further forward in time, the discovery was made of the actual truth, which was that the world was
round. Could the information that the world was round during the period prior to the actual discovery be construed
as misinformation/disinformation?

The factor of time MUST be considered in deciding whether information should be classified as truthful or not. What
misinformation/disinformation that is opinioned by the majority as conspiracy may later in time be discovered as being
the truth.

humanity. Is Australia being propelled into the beginnings of an experimental world of dystopia, as in Oceania (1984,
George Orwell) or Gilead (Handmaid’s Tale)? The concept of taking control of people’s thinking and interpretation is
certainly a significant mechanism by which this dystopia is realised.

What is the agenda behind this legislation bill? By whom is it being pushed? How does the ACMA decide what is
misinformation and disinformation? Who is making those decisions? Do they have vested interests?

What are the consequences and penalties for misinformation that our state and federal governments face, should
they be found to have spread misinformation in the public arena? Three years since the COVID misinformation and
rules were being enforced by government officials and bodies, there have been no consequences for the damage that
has been caused to millions of Australians, either by way of loss of jobs, physical health disabilities (including death),
etc. The government must be subjected to the same penalties as what is being placed upon Australian citizens if it is
found to be spreading misinformation.

It is interesting to read the current issues, such as US-funded ASPI interfering in the Regional Bank Closure debate and
that campaign to be included in the new ACMA social media legislation. Since when does the US have the right to
dictate to Australia about issues that have nothing to do with them? How far will this go?

Any person with an ounce of common sense can see that this legislation amendment bill is fraught with dangers! God
help us all if this passes through.

People are intelligent enough to decide for themselves what information they are going to believe or not believe – it
is up to each individual to decide what they read/don’t read. Nobody has the right to take this basic of human rights
away from us.

Why not focus on a piece of legislation that will actually make a huge difference to peoples’ lives, such as improving
the health care system, eradicating homelessness, establishing a Public Postal Banking Service, building infrastructure
that will improve the lives of all Australians?
