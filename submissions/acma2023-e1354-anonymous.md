This proposed Bill to combat “misinformation and disinformation” must be wholly rejected.

If the last three years during the pandemic have taught us anything, it’s that top-down, heavy-handed approaches by governments
ultimately do not promote trust in our institutions but degrade it. Public trust in our governments and in media outlets such as the
ABC is at an all time low, as evidenced by the decreased primary vote for the two major political parties and slumping media
ratings.

This Bill will achieve the opposite effect of its purported intended purpose. Its authoritarian approach will further decrease trust in
our governments. This will prove disastrous for our country and will foster disunity.

One extremely and irresponsibly aspect of the Bill is that content authorised by the government would be exempt. Why? High
handed and controlling government out of touch with the Australian public. Government effecting a dumbing down of the public
voice.

I consider it incredible that a government would be willing to make a law and then exempt itself from that law. This Bill is
proposing one rule for the government and a different rule for the general public (everyone else). Such contempt for us, the
Australian people, whom the government is supposed to serve must be condemned. Disgraceful!

I believe that it can justifiably be said that this Bill is of the same ilk as a proposal that someone might expect under a Soviet-style,
communist regime. This is Australia and we the general public do not want, do not condone such an arrogant attitude from
government.
