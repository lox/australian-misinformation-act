I am concerned that the proposed legislation will impose more restrictions on our rights to
free speech through censorship of social media posts and comments.

First, what constitutes ‘misinformation’ and/or ‘disinformation’ that is ‘harmful’ is to be
decided by government, through its appointed body, ACMA. This is potentially dangerous as
it is open to broad interpretation, driven by self-interest. It suggests that any view that does
not comply with or advance or endorse the narrative that government approves of, should
be suppressed through its removal from social media. Online platforms will be forced to
censor ‘unwelcome’ comments due to the threat of onerous fines being imposed by ACMA.

Second, for government to exempt itself and its surrogates from opinions that may be
construed as ‘mis/disinformation that is harmful’ when voiced by others, is cynical and selfserving. It suggests that the real intention of this proposed legislation is to censor opposition
to the approved narrative. It allows government to be the sole judge of ‘the truth’ in the
pursuit of its agendas. No opposition is to be discussed/tolerated. Orwellian, indeed!

One of the hallmarks of a democracy is freedom of expression of views that not everyone
may agree with. During the Covid period, we saw consistent overreach by government
attempting to silence discussion that it had labelled ‘misinformation’. In many instances, it
was subsequently revealed that the alternative views had been correct, so government itself
was guilty of ‘misinformation’! Surely, the NO campaign would also be accused of peddling
‘misinformation’ if government was to have this legislation in place before the referendum
is held!

Third, freedom of speech was enshrined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights which Australia helped to draft in 1948. It states, “Everyone has the right to freedom
of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of
frontiers.” In my view, the proposed legislation is clearly in breach of this noble principle
which, to my knowledge, Australia is still committed to uphold.

In conclusion, I believe this proposed legislation is designed to impose government-directed
censorship of dissenting views. It will restrict the rights of freedom of speech and expression
of Australians even more, by stifling and shutting down open discussion and debate.
