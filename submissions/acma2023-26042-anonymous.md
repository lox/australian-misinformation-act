I’ve been reading the draft

following comments to

make.

Note:

Disinfo

n

include

s

disinfo

n by or

on

behalf

of a

foreign

power.

(3) For the

purposes of

this

digital

reasonably

likely to

cause or

contribute to

serious harm,

have regard

to the

following

matters:

;

(h)

t

matter.

Note:

See

the

definiti

on of

_harm_

in

clause

2.

(4) Subclause (2) does

not limit subclause (1).

So, the bill intends to, in

essence create an

additional role of an

arbitrary body, within

ACMA ;

As highlighted by Alex

Antic

Liberal Senator for South

# Communicati ons and Media Authority (ACMA) the authority to “develop a code of practice covering measures to combat misinformatio

# n on digital platforms, which the ACMA could register and enforce.” By “enforce,” they mean that corporations, such as social media platforms,


-----

# “misinformati on” or “disinformatio n” could face penalties of up to $2.75 million, and individuals could be penalised with fines of up to $0.55 million.


-----

# “rules made under the Bill may require digital platform services to have systems and processes in place to address misinformatio n or


-----

# a threshold of being likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

And

# One category of harm outlined in the Fact Sheet is, “Harm to the health of A t li ”

-----

# considered “hate”

One is compelled to

strongly agree with the

concerns expressed by

Senator Antic.

In view of these facts the

following concerns and

questions come to light.

## ● Censorship of

information with

which the “body”

does not agree, in

their opinion. My

question bring who

can declare that the

body’s opinion is

correct?

## ● Who is to be the

judge of

misinformation, on

Meyer named A

Return of the God

Hypothesis

available. There are

many YouTube

discussions around

this book. The book

puts forward a

theory that Science

has changed its

mind about the

‘origins of species’

and it puts forward

arguments for

“Intelligent Design”.

Would the

references made by

a person on

Facebook to a

group of “friends”

be considered

Orwell in his book

Animal Farm are

coming to pass 
where we are all

equal but some are

more equal than

others? Also the

are scenarios

spoken about within

his other book

Nineteen Eighty

in our present age?

Are the Australian

allowed to think and

believe?

Are we no longer

entitled to our own

opinion? Who has

the right to take

that from us?

Are we on the brink

of becoming like

Germany under the

Nazis or East

Germany under the

Stasi? Noting that

these organisations

are no longer “in

power”.

On consideration of what

would be a useful

approach around the

containing of “mis and dis

information’, the

management of

Foreign interference - the

likes of TikTok content

and content from similar

sources, would be more

sensible and productive.

This is what should be

considered.
