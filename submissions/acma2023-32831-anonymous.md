Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Ms Rowland,

I am writing this submission to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill threatens
the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and unfairly categorizes citizens into
two distinct classes. I urge the department to reconsider the implications of this bill and
to take into account its potential harm to regular citizens in our democracy.

First and foremost, the bill's creation of two classes of citizens is deeply troubling. By
granting the power to spread potentially false or misleading information exclusively to
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions, while restricting regular
citizens from doing the same, the bill effectively undermines the freedom of speech of
ordinary people. Regular citizens often possess valuable knowledge and insights,
including industry insiders, and should not be silenced or marginalized in the democratic
process.

Furthermore, the excessive fines outlined in the bill will result in digital services
becoming more restrictive in their speech than ever before. This restriction, coupled with
the lack of "pressure escape valves" in the system, will have a detrimental impact on the
freedom of speech on the internet. It is imperative to acknowledge that the internet is a
powerful democratic tool that gives voice to regular people, and this bill poses a
significant risk to their ability to express themselves openly.

Additionally, the task of accurately judging what is true or untrue is an impossible one.
New information is constantly emerging, contradicting what was once accepted as fact
by authorities and expert consensus. The bill's scope is so broad that it may encompass
content that was once considered factual but has since been proven false. This not only

threatens freedom of speech but also impedes open and honest debates necessary for
finding common ground and uncovering the truth.

The bill's inclusion of "misleading" or "deceptive" information raises further concerns.
Freedom of speech should allow for open discussions and the exploration of various
viewpoints, even if they may be inaccurate or misinformed. The proposed legislation
overlooks the value of freedom of speech, which allows for the examination and
challenge of ideas and fosters a healthy democratic society.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has
expressed serious concerns about the bill's scope and application on his personal
Twitter account. His criticism raises questions about the credibility and impact of this
legislation, particularly on health information. It is imperative to consider the
perspectives of experts who have reservations about the bill and its potential
consequences.

Moreover, the bill appears to focus solely on larger platforms such as Facebook, Reddit,
and Twitter, while inadvertently bringing thousands of community websites within its
scope. This lack of specificity and consideration for smaller websites and foreign
platforms raises concerns about the disproportionate impact and legal risks imposed on
individuals or companies unaware of the industry codes. This bill should not
inadvertently penalize and cause undue harm to independent website owners who may
not even be aware of their obligations under this legislation.

Furthermore, the granting of legislative power to private entities, such as companies
responsible for creating misinformation codes, accentuates the unconstitutional
abdication of legislative power. This delegation of power to entities not directly
responsible to Parliament contradicts principles of democratic governance and should
be reviewed with great caution.

The bill's impact on the freedom of political communication is also concerning. By
allowing codes, standards, and rules to censor certain political party viewpoints, the bill
jeopardizes the access to diverse and necessary information for informed voting
decisions. Independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers may face
reputational damage due to misinformation reports, thereby limiting their capacity to
provide alternative perspectives. This influences public opinion and undermines the
principles of democracy and free speech.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 infringes upon the freedom of speech and imposes
unreasonable restrictions on citizens' rights and liberties. Its broad scope, lack of clarity,
and potential repercussions on smaller websites and independent voices are deeply
concerning. I urge the department to reconsider this bill's provisions and work towards a
more inclusive and balanced approach that respects the principles of democracy,
freedom of speech, and access to diverse viewpoints.

Thank you for considering this submission, and I hope that my concerns are taken into
account during the bill's review process. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you
require any further information.

Yours faithfully,
