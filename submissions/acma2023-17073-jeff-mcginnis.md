I write to voice my fear and disgust at the proposed

“Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023”

This bill will be the end of free speech in this country and must not be passed, now or ever!

To suggest a law that is so open for abuse by governments, now and into the future, is absurd and in
my opinion, blatantly evil in intent.

If passed, it will enable the shutting down of all debate prior to the Voice referendum, all debate
prior to future elections and has the aim to financially destroy those with opinions that differ from
the government.

This and the previous government, have been proven, to have been posting misinformation and
disinformation with regard to Covid 19 injection efficacy and transmissibility, so who is to say that
this will not and cannot happen in the future?

In a democracy, free public discussion and debate must be allowed to continue unfettered.

This bill is something I would expect to have come from the pre-world war 2 German government
and probably did.

Shame on the authors of this Bill and shame on all who support it.

I thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns whilst I still can.

Yours sincerely,

Jeff McGinniss
