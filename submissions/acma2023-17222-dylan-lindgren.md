**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023: Exposure Draft Feedback**

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the exposure draft of the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023, which was requested of the public on 24th June 2023.

I’d first like to say I’m writing this as a concerned citizen, and the views outlined in my
submission are entirely my own and not that of my employer.

I was born in Newcastle, Australia in the mid-80’s, and lived there throughout the 90’s and
00’s. It was there where my passion for technology was formed, and in particular what
inspired me was the Internet and how it allowed anyone in the world with a connection and a
computer to build communities no matter where in the world they are. It was due to its free
and open nature. Anyone can start and run a website. This passion for tech helped me to
start, manage, & participate in many online communities & websites over the last 25 years.

One example of this is in the early 2000’s, when I was a member of a forum run out of the
USA called Prelude Online. This forum was about Honda Preludes – my first car, and it had
a sub-forum for the Australian community where we kept in touch and organised meetups.
Unfortunately this forum closed down, and our community was left without a home.

I got together with a friend from the community and co-started a dedicated Australian
website called Prelude Australia (PreludeAustralia.com.au). Prelude Australia was
essentially a web forum where registered users could post messages about any topic they
found interesting, organise meetups, and list and buy items for sale. From memory, we had
thousands of members, and we used the open source software phpBB running on our own
web host. Although I relinquished control of it in the mid-2000’s, until recently it was still
online and running. It seems to have been taken over for another purpose in 2020.

This early experience with the Internet as a teenager; the fact that anyone can start and run
a website and have their voice heard, instilled in me a strongly held belief that the Internet is
the most powerful democratic invention humanity has ever created.

My passion for the Internet and technology in general has led me to a career in the
technology industry. I have worked for law firms, recruitment agencies in their IT teams, and
in 2015 I joined an American cloud software company based in Silicon Valley, California. In
2021 I departed Australia and became a resident of Japan, living in . I still work for
the same company here in Japan.

I could not be more opposed to a bill. It is naive, reckless, and incredibly damaging to the
global free and open Internet. I urge the government to halt plans for introduction until the
concerns outlined in the rest of this submission are fully addressed.


-----

# Concern 1) Its scope is way too broad in the extreme

## Only Large Digital Service Considered, but Applies Widely

This bill has clearly given consideration only to the largest platforms like Facebook, Reddit,
and Twitter, and yet has brought in-scope (intentionally, or unintentionally) thousands and
thousands of community websites that are part of the “social web” due to its broad
definitions. Prelude Australia would have certainly been one of the websites in-scope, as it
was a “web forum”.

I can say without question that were this law to have been in place at the time, I would not
have started Prelude Australia. The law is way too broad, and is not encumbered in any way
to give regard to the size of platforms that it applies to.

Not being able to start Prelude Australia due to this law and the legal risk it would impose on
me I strongly feel would be an unreasonable restriction on my freedom and liberty, and my
right to freedom of speech and enterprise.

The law is so ignorantly broad that it feels akin to the Australian government setting a speed
limit on every road around the globe, which is already a ludicrous concept, but then to make
it even more ludicrous not even telling people what that speed limit is.

## Unreasonable to Expect Small Digital Services Comply
Under this bill, any website owner around the globe that currently has social features (such
as the ability for users to post comments on blog articles, or a forum such as Prelude
Australia) will potentially be at risk of fines of up to AU$500,000, and that’s if they are an
individual; if they are a company (as a lot of smaller websites are, so that they can earn
advertising income to pay for hosting bills), they are liable for fines of AU$2,500,000!

It is non-compliance with industry-created codes which causes an offence. If a website
owner doesn’t even know that a code exists, let alone that they need to comply with it, how
are they expected to do so? Will random small foreign website owners that don’t comply with
these industry-codes be stopped at the border and issued fines due to a law they didn’t even
know about?

## Hundreds of Thousands of Digital Services In-Scope
Since Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk, an exodus from that platform has been
occurring to various social media networks, one of which is Mastodon. There are apparently
7,500 Mastodon servers[1], all run by a varied assortment of people and organisations, and
this count is growing.

Is the government proposing that each of these individual server owners must comply with
these Australian industry codes, even if they are run from overseas and left open to the
Internet-at-large? Should every Mastodon server block any Australian user from visiting due

to the legal risk of allowing access to them, and thus having to comply with and enforce
these industry-codes?

## Required Modifications

I am not in a position to offer advice on how this concern could be addressed – it is a
lawmakers responsibility to ensure that a law they are proposing has sufficiently limited
scope. However, I would like to note that the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA)
limits its application using the concepts of:

1. VLOPs – Very Large Online Platforms[2]

2. VLOSEs– Very Large Online Search Engines[3]

These concepts to me seem much more reasonable as they only burden the largest
platforms with compliance requirements.

# Concern 2) Extraterritoriality must be limited

The proposed bill applies extraterritorially, and a digital service is captured under it and must
consider its implications if it has a single visitor from Australia. This is a ridiculous overreach
by Australia on what is a global Internet.

Given how many websites and services this law applies to (see Concern 1), it is a
completely ignorant expectation that large and small foreign digital services with no
knowledge of Australian law, no knowledge of the industry codes created by Australian
industry bodies, and no membership or representation on those industry bodies, be
expected to comply with it.

For example, an American may set up and host a web forum similar to the Prelude Australia
one that I created. This is a perfectly legal thing to do in America, however unbeknownst to
them one of their visitors is an Australian. This means that an industry code set by an
industry body representing “web-forums” in Australia would need to be complied with by this
website.

The concept of extraterritoriality, along with the scope of the digital services that this law
applies to, is a completely unworkable concept and only introduces uncertainty to the global
Internet that could very well see Australia become an outcast from the global Internet with
web servers created with a default “block Australia” option turned on.

How would Australians feel to have China saying that it’s the responsibility of Australian
websites to not publish misinformation (as defined in this law) about the Tiananmen
massacre? Remember, this is not just false things, but true things that are “misleading”.

Would this really be OK if it was agreed to be not published by an industry body in China?
And is it OK that Australian digital services would now need to comply with these Chinese
industry body codes?

What about if Australians were in legal jeopardy unbeknownst to them for running a website
in Australia, and they visited China and had issues at the border requiring payment of fines,
or imprisonment? Would the Australian government be happy with that arrangement? Of
course not!

China is free to set the rules for their Internet, just like Australia is. However, for China to say
that a digital service overseas, open to the public internet, has some form of responsibility to
comply with every single law in that country is ridiculous. China should just block that
website.

In fact, the Government recently admonished the Hong Kong government for doing a very
similar thing to what they propose happens under this draft bill. Two Hong Kong activists
based in Australia were charged extraterritorially under Hong Kong National Security Laws[4].

Senator Penny Wong made the following statement publicly:

-----

It’s a frankly insulting thing to say when on the other hand her own government is proposing
a law which applies extraterritoriality like this.

To use another example, Saudi Arabia could say that it is the responsibility of Australian
websites not to publish “misinformation” (as defined by this code) discussing the Saudi
King’s involvement in the murder of Jamal Kashoggi, because a court in Saudi Arabia
proved that he was not involved. Would the Australian government be happy with leaving
Australians, on Australian soil, at legal risk due to that arrangement? Of course not!

In its current state, the proposed bill is a dramatic overextension of Australian law onto
foreign entities in an extremely self-entitled and ignorant manner. The Australian government
has already made it clear very recently that we do not like it when laws like this apply to
Australians, so we shouldn’t be creating laws ourselves that apply to foreigners.

## Required Modifications

If a website has no intention of providing service to Australia, and is simply “open to the free
Internet”, they should not be covered by the bill and should simply be blocked.

Only if the digital service shows intent to provide service to Australia, such as establishing a
domestic office, local bank accounts, local business deals (e.g. advertising) should a digital
service be required to comply with these industry codes.

If the Australian Government does not like the content that appears on a foreign website, the
only correct response to that is for the Australian government to pass laws, or take action,
that restricts Australians access to those foreign websites.

The bill must be amended to offer blocking powers to ACMA for situations like this, and the
extraterritorial provisions must be limited to only those foreign digital services with intention
to provide services to users in Australia.


-----

Precedent has already been set for this in regards to ACMA’s powers to block gambling
websites. With those powers, ACMA can ask internet service providers to help them disrupt
illegal online content by blocking access to websites. This authority is given to ACMA under
the Telecommunications Act 1997 (section 313).

To propose otherwise shows either a lack of confidence that the misinfo/disinfo the
Australian government is intending to address is of sufficient impact. Or alternatively, that the
legislative path that the Australian government has chosen to take does not have the full
backing of Australian citizens.

# Concern 3) It will have highly anti-competitive effects

## Industry Bodies Become “Anti-Competitive Wedges”

Industry bodies are often stacked with and funded by – and thus most influenced by – the
biggest players in that particular industry. Often, new entrants to an industry do not have the
money or time to contribute to an industry body, as they are too busy getting their business
or product established.

With this influence by big the biggest players, it is extremely likely that the industry codes
proposed by the industry bodies that represent them will become “anti-competitive wedges”
that large digital services will use to “gatekeep” their industry from new competitors by
establishing onerous codes that are impossible to comply with for anything but the largest
digital services.

Furthermore, the incentive of ACMA established in this code is to be as maximalist as
possible. If an industry body comes to ACMA and says that they can do more than ACMA
originally thought was reasonable, then ACMA will likely accept that industry code.

Calls to regulate Facebook by executives of the company that owns that digital service, Meta
(e.g. Mark Zuckerberg), have been widely recognised as likely cynical attempts to ensure
Facebook never faces significant competition[5]. Facebook is the largest digital service in their
industry and potentially the only ones that can comply with regulations.

This proposed bill gives the biggest digital services in an industry the ability to not only write
their own regulations, but damage their smaller competitors by setting them up with
guaranteed infringement and onerous regulatory requirements.

## Free-Market Principles

Furthermore, the free-market competition between platforms when it comes to
misinfo/disinfo has recently shown evidence of working. Platforms with lax misinfo/disinfo
policies and enforcement will naturally have their users migrate to platforms that fulfil
community expectations in regards to these topics.

For example, many people currently have strong objections to the misinfo/disinfo policies
and enforcement on Twitter since Elon Musk bought it. This has led to a surge of sign ups for
competitive services such as Mastodon, and the release and uptake of new Twitter
competitors such as BlueSky, Post.news, and the “Twitter clone” that Meta is shortly
releasing called Instagram Threads[6].

## At-Odds with Competition Regulators

Lastly, the proposed code is utterly reliant on the current state of affairs of one or two
dominant digital services who set the policies, and the wipeout of small platforms and
websites for which the policies set by these industry bodies are too hard to comply with. This

makes the proposed bill at-odds with competition regulators around the globe who are doing
their best to lower barriers of entry for competitors to these platforms in the interest of
consumers.

## Required Modifications

Similar to the recommendations in Concern 1, I am not in a position to offer advice on how
this concern could be addressed.

It is a lawmakers responsibility to ensure that a law they are proposing can meet its stated
objectives and not be in conflict with other government objectives.

However, I would like to note again that the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA)
limits its application using the concepts of:

3. VLOPs – Very Large Online Platforms[7]

4. VLOSEs– Very Large Online Search Engines[8]

These concepts to me seem much more reasonable as they only burden the largest
platforms with compliance requirements, and the codes created by the industry bodies would
only apply to digital services meeting these definitions.

# Concern 4) Other laws are not fit-for-purpose in addressing challenges of misinfo/disinfo

## The News Media Bargaining Code

Under the previous Liberal government, and with the support of the Labor party, the News
Media Bargaining Code (NMBC) became law in 2021. This law allowed designation by the
Treasurer of defined digital services as “designated platforms”, which are required to bargain
with and enter agreements with eligible news media organisations.

The law defined “covered news content” essentially as the follows:

_●_ _Content that reports, investigates or explains:_

_○_ _Issues or events that are relevant in engaging Australians in public debate and in informing_
_democratic decision making_

_○_ _Current issues or events of public significance for Australians at a local, regional, or national_
_level_

_○_ _current issues or events of interest to Australians._

The law made it a discriminatory offence to show content meeting the definition above
anywhere on a designated platform[9] (even from non-eligible news organisations, fact
checkers, non-governmental organisations, or citizens), if that designated platform decided
not to participate in the local Australian news industry and thus did not show “covered news
content” from eligible news media businesses.

## Impacts on Misinfo/Disinfo

The Australian government must recognise their own culpability for limiting digital services
ability to address mis/disinfo through the enactment of the NMBC in its current form.

The NMBC forces a digital service that decides to not be part of the local Australian news
industry to remove all global content meeting the above definition in its entirety. They cannot
show any of this content or risk discriminatory offence under the law

The NMBC essentially uses content from non-eligible news organisations, fact checkers,
non-governmental organisations, or citizens that could be used to counter mis/disinfo as a
hostage to require digital services to pay money to eligible news organisations.

However this proposed bill is at odds with the NMBC as it hints at fact-checkers potentially
other methods involving news content as being beneficial to counter mis/disinfo.

## Required Modifications

The NMBC must be amended prior to introduction of this bill to exempt digital services from
discriminatory offences if the purpose of showing “covered news content” is to counter
misinfo/disinfo.

# Concern 5) Freedom of speech

I expect a lot of other submissions will cover the harmful restriction of freedom of speech in
Australia that this bill mandates be introduced. However, I would like to echo and add to
those concerns here as well.

That this bill exists makes it clear that the Government does not respect the freedom of
speech of Australian citizens.

## Two Classes of Citizens

The bill creates two classes of citizens:

  - **Class 1 (The” Truthy”/Free Class): Made up of politicians, journalists, members of**
educational institutions, all who will have the power to spread what is (correctly or
incorrectly) judged as false/misleading information online.

  - **Class 2 (The “Fake News”/Oppressed Class): The second group is everyone else;**
regular citizens in our democracy who often have more knowledge about topics than
anyone in the previous category, such as industry insiders.

As mentioned in my introduction, it is my strongly held belief that the Internet is the most
powerful democratic invention humanity has ever created. It has given a voice to regular
people, and this law risks harming the “Class 2” group of citizens disproportionately.

Due to the excessive fines, digital services will be much more restrictive of speech than even
the most restrictive digital services currently. The harm will be compounded by the fact that
the code applies across the entire industry and there are no “pressure escape valves” on the
system.

## Minorities Harmed

For a bill that's intended to protect minorities it very well may result in them being
persecuted. Often minorities are the ones oppressed by the current political realities, and the
way progress is achieved is through convincing people that what once was believed to be
fact is now untrue.

This bill mandates a single code be applied upon every digital platform in an industry, giving
minorities no shelter when the system pushes back on them.

## Judging Truth

It is an impossible task to accurately judge what is true or untrue. There is always new
information being discovered which contradicts what was once widely accepted fact.

For example, here is a list of things that at one point were stated as fact by authorities and
expert consensus (“Class 1” citizens), but were later found out to be false:

  - Masks don’t protect from COVID-19


-----

  - There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19

  - The COVID-19 vaccine stops you from catching the disease

  - The COVID-19 vaccine stops transmission

  - The COVID-19 vaccine is a 2-dose vaccine

  - The COVID-19 vaccine is a 3-dose vaccine

All of the above could very much be considered under this legislation to be public health
harm-causing misinformation. An industry-code, or a mandatory-code created by ACMA
would be very likely to require content similar to the above to be removed.

And to make matters worse, it’s not even provably false information that will be in scope for
removal. It is also true information which is “misleading” or “deceptive”.

Freedom of speech is so valuable as it allows open and honest discussions to take place
with no limits. It allows people to be wrong, and for truth to be debated for common ground
can be found.

Governments and people proposing bills like this like to pretend they are on the side of truth,
and not the side of censorship. However, even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, who was once a Deputy
Chief Medical Officer of Australia has raised serious concerns about the scope and
application of this bill via his personal Twitter account.

On 25th of June 2023, following the announcement of this bill, he posted the following tweet:

_“Misinformation is an accusation thrown so readily that such legislation would be_
_impossible to implement; and if it was implemented, would inevitably lead to fines_
_being levied on things that are not, or turn out not to be.”_

If expert consensus is so trustworthy then what does that say about the bill when one of
those very experts it appointed to be a steward of truth when it comes to health information
comes out with this scathing rebuke to it.


-----

## Required Modifications

At the very least, if the Government is insistent on passing some form of this law, the least
dumb thing to do would be to modify the definition of misinformation and disinformation,
reducing them both in scope to only include provably false information.

True information (e.g. that which can be considered to be misleading) must not be in scope
for this bill due to the large impact on free speech doing so would have. It must also not be in
scope due to the fact that there are large fines involved if mistakes are made – and at the
scale of almost all digital services it is inevitable a lot of mistakes will be made in judging
what kind of content could be considered “misleading”.

# Conclusion

Thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback in regards to this proposed bill.

I trust that my feedback, along with other submitters, will be given the time and consideration
required to address all concerns raised.
