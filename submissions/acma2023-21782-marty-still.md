 Re Misinformation and disinformation:

 Seems to me, our so called, government is hell bent on stopping freedom of speech altogether. Exactly who is it decides what is misinformation and/or disinformation? 

 We have the TGA, a supposedly government body, who are largely, (more than 90%) ‘self’ funded. A government body, self funded? And who funds them? The people who have the most to gain, the pharmaceutical companies. So, is the information given out by the TGA accurate or is it what they are told to say by their sponsors? Is it accurate information, misinformation or disinformation? I think the past three years has shown us exactly what they and our, so called, government are capable of. So, our, so called, government are sending millions of dollars to an overseas war that has nothing whatever to do with us, they are funding the WEF, a private organization, they fund the WHO and cower before the UN, all the while our TGA is funded by pharmaceutical companies. This is information, not misinformation or disinformation. 

 Let’s look at Scomo. ‘This is Australia, we don’t have mandates’. Righto, no mandates in Australia. I need say no more on that one. Our, so called, government have inflicted so much stress and hardship on its citizens through mandates, it doesn’t bear thinking about. Job losses, lack of productivity, mortgage defaults, the list goes on.

 It is also clear that the media has been manipulated and censored in order to promote a government agenda. Is deception by omission classed as disinformation? Are we to only believe that which our, so called, government tell us? Are our, so called, government therefore guilty of misinformation and disinformation? Yes, I believe they are.

 Our, so called, government have repeatedly claimed the covid 19 vaccine is safe and effective, they are saying it even now when it is blatantly obvious that this is not true. Where is their ‘information’ coming from? The TGA, who are largely funded by the pharmaceutical companies, and they have the most to gain by them promoting the vaccine.

# When it comes to hate speech, why do we not have the right to hate something equally as much as we may love something? Right now, I hate a particular group in our society, that group is called politicians. I absolutely believe our recent batch of politicians do not have the best interests of Australians at heart, I believe they are merely gaining power and following a personal agenda. I believe the world would be a better place if we were to get rid of Dan Andrews, Scomo, Albo and several other current and ex state premiers for their part in the reign of tyranny seen in Australia in recent times, is nothing short of Nazi.

 When all this is over, I am sure that Scomo, Andrews, Albo and others will go down in the history books alongside Stalin, Idi Amin, Pol Pot and, of course, our old mate Adolf Hitler. They all used the same proper gander tactics that you, our, so called, government are using now, all under the guise of preserving democracy and free speech. Mire misinformation!

 We have always known that politicians lie but I have never before seen the level of misinformation and disinformation coming out of politician’s mouths than I have seen in recent years. I am disgusted with the lot of you and will shed no tears if we see Australia’s first assassination of a political figure. As said Thomas Jefferson, ‘When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty’. Personally, I look forward to the day you are, our, so called, government, are held responsible for the actions you are performing today.

 As far as this amendment goes, I am absolutely against it as I am sure it will only be used as a vehicle to create yet another overpaid bureaucratic institution and to further withhold, suppress and censor free speech, all in the name of democracy. Perhaps you should be reminded that a democracy does not censor media.
