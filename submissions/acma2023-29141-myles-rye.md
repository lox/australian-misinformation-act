The Chair, Australian Cornmunications and Media Authority

Dear Chair,

I write in response to the ACMA's request for feedback on the [proposed ]Communications Legislation

Amendment (Combatting Misinforrnation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 [(the ]Bill)"

The Bill, despite the political rhetoric, is nothing short of [government ] censorship.

It is clearly apparent that this government DOES NOT WANT A COUNTRY OF CRITICAL THINKERS

WHO ARE CAPABLE OF THINKING FOR THEMSELVES. The ACMA as a government agent, through this

Bill seeks to purport that only governments know the truth and as such will control media [platforms]

through [punitive ] actions to stifle any information that a [government ] agency [does ]not [believe ] [meets]
the states' narrative. This a key fuature of totalitarianism.

Governments in this country and some other [previously ] democratic nations have completely
forgotten it is the people who run a democracy, and any such containment of information as
outlined in this bill, solely at the discretion of a government agency, is simply a tool for a transition
to totalitarianism, in which propaganda, misinformation and disinformation is controlled by the state

in order to control the people" lt is clearly undemocratic.

This is further exacerbated under the following extract of the Bill:

exeluded contentfor misinformution parposes means any of the following:
## (a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire; (b) professional news content; (c) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited by any ofthe
following:
# (i) the Commonwealth; (ii) a State; (iii) a Territory;
## (iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth. a State or a Teritory as att
accreditor of educational institutions;

The federal and state governments, their agencies and bureaucrats. as well as the "Professional

news content" have shamelessly lied to the people and provided so much misinformation, and
disinformation, [particularly ] over our recent history, [yet ]they are excluded from being held
accountable for misinformation under this Bill! lt is abhorrent that the federal [government ] would
think this acceptable to the people, Shame on any bureaucrat that assists this undemocratic, anti-
Australian law to pass, as its sole purpose is clearly to stifle free speech and the discussion of ideas,

{

This, in exchange for the notion that only the [government, ] [its ][politicised ] bureaucrats [and its]

supported mainstream media know the truth.

This condescending, dictatorial [piece ]of legislation [is ]an affront to our [democracy and ][collective]

intelligence. The oxymora and hypocrisy of including a definition of harm from [misinformation ] [as:]

"harm to the integrity of Australian democratic [processes ] or of Commonwealth, [State, ][Territory or]

local governrnent institutions;" when this bill itself is of [great ] [harm ] to our democratic [processes ] [of]

open debate and discussion, whereby the reasonable individual [is ][able ]to [make ][their ][own ][decisions]

and undertake their own research, uninhibited by [government ] [censorship.]

Where is the appeal process? When so called fact checkers [get ]it wrong, and where [it ][is ][clear ][from]

recent events here and particularly in the USA, where it [has ] been [proved ]that ["Fact Checkers" ] [were]

not checking facts, but checking compliance with [government ] narratives; where [is ]the accountability

of the ACMA for its decisions to curtail real facts from being [publlshed? There ] [is ][no appeal ] [process.]

The ACMA, ie, the government of the day, only, have the final say on what can [be ][discussed ]openly.

This Bill is not appropriate for a democratic society and should be withdrawn [in ]toto.
