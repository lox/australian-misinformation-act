Rather than a sudden chop of a feed. It could be more informative to have a rating number of factual
integrity in the headline of all feeds. Any automated system will be developing a rating of some sort
upon which any action would be taken. I see no reason why that could not be displayed. With
perhaps a drop down which states in brief how the rating was achieved. Possibly quoting the
sources it has been compared to. I believe that would be of great value to the general viewing
public and an incentive to those posting content.

At no time is the Government to have the last say on truth. This seems to be the case as I read the
information supplied. If the “code “ has the assumption that any government statements are true and
all that contradicts it therefore is false, if we have a situation like that it would in practice put the
government beyond accountability. All posts including those from government need to be check in
the same manor.
It is unclear how the ACMA will deem that the code of conduct adopted as inadequate. This leaves
concern that the lack of definition could lead to decisions being open to conjecture as to bias or
falsehood. This is the stuff that fuels misinformation and disinformation.

During the COVID pandemic it seemed the majority of the Mis/ Disinformation gained traction
from a distrust of the mainstream news and government announcements. This whole push is aimed
at media platforms. The other side is worth addressing. Firstly it seems that there is a major
assumption that the News publications being accountable to the ACMA will stop all Misinformation
and Disinformation? It is my option that the Government gave fuel, at least in part by not giving the
basis of its statistics. The number of COVID deaths was presented giving the impression that the
number given was people who literal died of COVID. Only quite some time later was it admitted
that if a person tested positive to COVID then their death was recorded as a COVID death. When in
fact no symptoms of COVID was necessarily a factor in their death. The range of impact of the
disease is vast. So it will never be known what number actually died from COVID. It could be as
low as 1/5 of the numbers stated. Some would say 1/20.

Have you tested positive for COVID but had no symptoms? Scientists find a
gene that could explain why

One in five people who test positive for COVID don't get symptoms. This could

be explained by a genetic variant and exposure to the common cold, a new

study suggests.

So straight up that puts the stat out by 20% before we look further.
The Government Needs to be as transparent as possible, giving full disclosure on how the stats
actually were arrived at.

When you consider the states of emergency imposed, and actions taken that would otherwise not
been considered justified apart from the pandemic, it is easy to see how an impression that some
thing is a miss in the corridors of power could be arrived at.

Even reading through the stats given in the recommended reading suggested regarding the proposed
bill, the nature and manner of questions asked to gain the data is not mentioned. You can make stats
support anything at all depending on how you frame the questions. One of the disturbing results of
the stats given was there was a group that did not appear to be aware of the fact that all media is
biased to some degree, and missed the skew on the COVID deaths.

I wore masks, had tests and took the vaccine, but how do you expect the general population to
believe a politician when the major election promises are totally disposable, and all sides of politics
goes to extreme lengths to discredit other, presenting info at the most opportune time in a manner
which has maximum damage on other parties even if they are doing a good job one party will
always find fault with other.

Then Suddenly we are to believe they are speaking totally with out bias?

I consider the presentation of COVID deaths by the government as misinformation, and it would be
appropriate for the government to be called out the same way as everyone else. It could appear that
the government overstated the deaths from COVID in order to generate greater acceptance and
compliance to its directives that would have been harder to justify if the numbers quoted were less.
Even if the actual numbers were given compliance would have been similar, but by being straight
and frank about how the numbers were derived could have reduced the disinformation problem.

So all media should be under the same directives. If it is not then it will fuel miss and
disinformation because of the apparent double standard leaving the door open for distrust.

No media platform could survive with the continuous threat of large fines. The ACMA could at any
time deem an organisation as non compliant, and impose penalties as to Guidance Notes 4.5.3 As
there is no objective determinant given as to what is enough. That would lead to fear of offending
and over censorship of a platform.
There seems to be much aimed at killing the propagation of misinformation, but very little on taking
action against over active censorship. Both should be an offence carrying similar penalty.

I consider it to be very hard to implement and an additional cost which the provider would have to
pass on to the consumer. The cost of living is skyrocketing and any additional cost should be
avoided. In the statistics given there was a high awareness of miss an dis information which
reduces it impact considerably. Although it is a concern the information presented indicates the
industry is already acting to reduce the impact, as the problem is already being tackled I see no need
for the government to step in at this stage.
As with any surgery there are always side effects and time required to absorb the pain and cost of
the change. In view of the industry changes already noted in the documents presented, I see no need
for this bill to be pushed through at all.
