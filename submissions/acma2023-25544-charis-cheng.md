The High Court of Australia has ruled that Freedom of Speech is allowed in Australia since it is
fundamental to a functional government and a cohesive society. Even though the right to Freedom of
Speech is not guaranteed or protected by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, it would violate every
state’s Bill of Rights, which all list Freedom of Speech as one of the protected rights. That means that any
speech, including hate speech, is permitted under the Bill of Rights. Unfortunately, bureaucrats and
corrupt officials in the Australian Government have removed our rights for their own benefit at the
expense of the rest of us.

And we don’t have to look far back in time to know the consequences of such actions.

In the US, the FBI knowingly told the media that the Hunter Biden Laptop Story was fake when they
knew it was true, having founded Hunter’s laptop all the way back in 2017. Only now does the FBI
officially claim that the laptop story was true. In Michigan, conservatives are being indicted for “falsely
claiming that the 2020 election was stolen.” Thankfully the Republicans are now back in the house thank
goodness. Every single time the victims of these so-called combatting “disinformation” bills are always
conservatives like me. I don’t want what the FBI did to twitter users who claimed that the Hunter Biden
Laptop story was real to happen to Australia. This is why I personally think that when the Republicans are
in the White House the United States of America is by far the best country on earth.

In Singapore, the government has only allowed citizens to exercise their right to Freedom of Speech
under their constitution in a small park called Speaker’s Corner. The government also gave itself the
power to determine what’s true and what’s not. Publishers of “false” information will face fines and/or
jail time and any time the government tells the publisher that what they wrote was false they must apply
these corrections to their pieces.

This is why I have zero confidence in the government not abusing their newfound powers. If this bill goes
through, it will lead to the weaponization of the government against conservatives, pro-life citizens and
the opposition. Just like what happened in the US, there will be a two-tiered justice system in this
country if this is the sort of stuff our elected representatives in government continue to do. In what
world does any of our state’s bill of rights allow the government to suppress Australians’ right to Free
Speech? I find this very disturbing.

Also, who on earth decides what’s the hell’s “disinformation?” We already know based on similar laws
passed in other western countries that it is always used to target people on the other side of the aisle
(particularly those on the right) and that most of the things that they censor turn out to be true. Instead
of suppressing free speech, our government should be working to stop big tech from censoring
conservatives who are just exercising their right to freedom of speech guaranteed under each state’s Bill
of Rights.

To be clear, removing child pornography from the internet is not the same as silencing someone because
they thought that an election was stolen, for instance. Child pornography is not “speech” – it is an abuse
of children’s rights. Removing child pornography from the internet I totally endorse. Unfortunately, the
radical Albanese Government’s agenda is making our country go woke and is failing all Australians,
silencing Christians, the opposition and conservatives by claiming that they are spreading
“disinformation” as a cover.

The government’s infrastructure website states that and I quote, “Misinformation and disinformation
pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and
economy.” That claim is disinformation and misinformation in and of itself. Misinformation and
disinformation do not in any way pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, or threaten
our country in any way. That’s the High Court’s opinion, not me. They stated in their ruling the complete
opposite to what the current government’s saying today.

I believe that any speech, no matter how extreme or offensive, should not be suppressed in any way as
everyone is subject to equal treatment under the law and each state’s bill of rights specifically
guarantees freedom of speech. It doesn’t say “Freedom of unoffensive or unhateful speech,” it just says
“Freedom of Speech.” Under no circumstances should the government strip citizens of their rights. I
would argue that each state’s Bill of Rights guarantees complete freedom of speech, which is a right our
government has never completely honoured and they’re certainly not trying to honour it now.

So when the government tells us that they want to seek the public’s opinion on an “Appropriate balance
on a range of issues,” that question has already been answered by each state and territory– freedom of
speech comes first.

We’re losing our identity as a nation. At the same time, we really are being laughed and scuffed at
throughout the world – they’re just not respecting and treating our country the way they used to. And
this bill will just further erode public trust and confidence in our government nor improve our image to
the rest of the world.

So yes, Anthony Albanese, we know what your true intentions are. We know that you are up to no good.
And we know exactly what you want to do.
