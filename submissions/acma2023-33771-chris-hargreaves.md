**SUBMISSION: THE COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING**
**MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION) BILL 2023 – HAVE YOUR SAY**

## Introduction
In a country where elected officials can’t even agree on how many pages long the Uluru
Statement from the Heart is, the Government should think twice before dropping a
hammer on things it considers to be “misinformation” or “disinformation”.

Misinformation began when the serpent whispered to Eve in the garden and hasn’t
slowed down since.

There is no real doubt that the rise of the internet and social media has inevitably
amplified its reach.

However, the “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation” Bill is a deeply
concerning legislative overreach that effectively mandates the active censorship of
Australian citizens.

The Bill is founded upon pandemic-specific research with woefully small cohorts that
ought not to be the foundation for a political, ideological tilt towards silencing open
discussion of issues in this country by its populace. The research itself fails to reach any
conclusion that would support the implementation of this legislation, despite the
apparent pretence otherwise.


-----

The Bill itself seeks to force already powerful companies to take even more control and
power over their users. This provides an easy foundation for obvious politically
motivated weaponization – a use that any cursory glance at the events of recent years
should confirm will readily be embraced.

Finally, the Bill offers a definition of “harm” that moves well beyond any possible
sensible interpretation of that word. The subject matter of this purported “harm” is
transparently political, overly broad, and fundamentally disinterested in protecting
users from actual harm in its ordinary sense.

Any well-meaning government seeking to serve its citizens diligently should abhor this
legislation. Government attention would best be focused on a self-reflective assessment
of why trust in government and news media is at an all-time low. If it did so, it would
more likely than not find that government mistrust is a function of the actions and
statements of the Government itself and that embracing so-called misinformation in the
manner sought to be addressed by this Bill is putting the cart before the horse. It is far
more likely that those who ALREADY lack trust in the Government and mainstream
media who seek out this information and spread it rather than the information being
the cause of that.

The predictable and inevitable impact of this Bill and its implementation, if passed, will
only be to lower institutional trust further, drive “misinformation” into other places
where it cannot be scrutinized as easily, and foster further malcontent among those
who already had it.

## The Underlying Research
The research that supposedly forms the foundation for the Code previously, and now
the Bill:

1. Is underpowered;
2. Is based on unproven assumptions;
3. Fails to establish the causation that the Bill depends upon for efficacy;
4. Demonstrates that the true concern is not really about “misinformation” as
much as it is about “did not accept the Government position”.

### The Research Cohort
To establish the supposed importance of this topic (which in turn notionally warranted
the development of the Code of Conduct previously, and now justifies the
implementation of the Bill), the ACMA report[1] substantially depends on an earlier
N&MRC report.[2]

The N&MRC report itself was a:

1. Quantitative study conducted via online survey on 2,659 people, half of whom
had done a near identical survey previously; and

2. Quantitative study conducted on merely 60 participants.

No obvious attempt (at least, not one that this mere mortal can find) was made in the
N&MRC data to express the statistical significance of the outcomes.

The ACMA report, for its part, included reference to and reliance upon the “We are
Social” report. Again, a quantitative report based on a tiny sample of data available, and
subject to limitations that even the ACMA report accepted as being relevant.

So the Bill is a piece of legislation drafted in substantial reliance on a survey or interview
conducted on something like 0.01% of the Australian population in terms of identifiable
numbers.

If the topic was less serious, then such an approach might be acceptable.

But where the topic involves not just handing power, but mandating it, to large
international tech companies who have a history of data theft, manipulation and
agenda-driven decision-making, then surely someone should be enquiring whether the
underlying report requires more questioning or broader research before it is given such
authorization?

In terms of the qualitative study, the sample size is frankly so small for such an
apparently important issue that the study barely qualifies as a pilot, and it is almost
outrageous that any action at all is being considered in reliance on it. If I was to ask 60
people I know their views on a complex topic (let alone 26m, the number of people who
will be impacted by this Bill), I am almost certainly going to receive a diverse range of
views and not ones that be boiled down to something as trite as “true” or “not true”,
even though that is fundamentally what this study has attempted to do.

### Unproven Assumptions
The ACMA report from 2021 commences its Environmental Assessment with the
dramatic declaration that “disinformation and misinformation has become an
increasingly overt threat to Australia, and of growing concern to nearly all Australians”.

The source for this bold proposition is, bafflingly, an ABC news article about how we
don’t trust Instagram influencers. The article does not discuss the “increasingly over
threat” nor even start to consider what “threat” actually means. And, in truth, the fact
that we don’t trust Instagram influencers is an indication that misinformation isn’t really
a threat at all, and that the majority of people have mechanisms in place to
automatically be sensitive to the potential for being misled by such people.

Is misinformation a “threat”? How? What precisely is meant by this word? How is it a
threat to the entirety of Australia? The drama inherent in the proclamation is clear, but
its backing is non-existent.

Surely these questions must be answered before government intervention on a topic is
even warranted for consideration, let alone taking the dramatic and concerning step of
encroaching on the ability of public discourse to occur?

No, instead the ACMA seems to have simply started from the underlying assumption
that the mere existence of misinformation and the exposure of people to it is, in fact, a
“threat” (whatever that means). That is neither proven nor is it demonstrably true.

What is demonstrably true, however, is that governments of the past who have
attempted to control information to the extent now contended for have been inevitably
governments we now consider to be fundamentally evil. The concept of controlling
misinformation in the way being encouraged here (albeit through the hands of
corporations that have no duty to the citizens of this country)) has been well tested

Page 04

through propaganda of the past and the results for the citizens of those countries have
always been bad.

### Causation
The underlying premise behind the Bill is this:

1. People are exposed to “misinformation” (in this case, meaning information that
does not accord with government messaging on a given topic);

2. As a result, this lowers trust in a government;
3. Therefore if we control (or force others to control) their exposure to the alleged
misinformation, that will lower the amount of mistrust and avoid the “threat”
(see above) that misinformation holds.

Nothing in either the ACMA report nor the N&MRC study begin to attempt to establish
this type of causation, despite it being foundational to the Bill.

### Defining Misinformation
The Bill itself defines misinformation broadly as set out in clause 7.

However, the ACMA report and underlying study give us slightly more insight into how
the concept of misinformation is more likely to be treated as a matter of practical
implementation.

What we see is that the idea of “misinformation” was not as much referred to a
standard of objective truth, but rather to whether an individual agreed with the
government's position. Thus our questions were:

1. I am confident that official medical guidelines and treatment for COVID-19 in my
State or Territory

2. COVID-19 vaccines that are approved by the health authorities in Australia are
safe

3. In most cases COVID-19 can be prevented or treated by simple remedies such as
taking vitamins and supplements;

4. The risks posed by COVID-19 are being exaggerated by people in power who
want to take advantage of the situation

5. Wearing a mask does not significantly reduce your risk of infection or spreading
the virus.

Page 05


-----

Those who answered “wrong” (ie – different from the government line) were
considered misinformed.

Of course, each question is so monumentally subjective that they are nearly useless for
any probative value. Dozens of studies exist on the medical aspects of each question
(with nuanced answers in each direction, sometimes supportive and other times not),
none of which were considered or referred to in the study.

No, the apparent “right” answer to these questions cannot lie in subtly or nuance –
what is right is, it seems, whatever the Government tells you (ignoring for a moment
that different governments took different views on some issues, and so two people in
different States could answer question 1 the same despite different recommendation in
their State).

The concept of objective truth as it relates to disinformation or misinformation was not
present in the study, at all. Nor is it present in the ACMA report, and that underlying
philosophy (as we will see) has flowed through to the Bill.

## The Bill
We have spent some time looking at the underlying basis for the Bill, because knowing
where something has come from gives us a good idea of how it will be used. Now we
turn to the language of the Bill itself.

Specifically:

1. The wide and political definition of “harm” (and the lack of any definition for
“serious”)

2. The baffling decision to give legislative power to tech companies;
3. The inevitable weaponization of the Bill.

### “Serious Harm”
The Bill, as discussed above, is predicated on the unproven idea that misinformation
itself constitutes a “threat”. Flowing from that, the Bill seeks only to combat
misinformation or disinformation where the “provision of the content on the digital
service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”.

Page 06

#### What is Harm?
Which begs the immediate question – what is harm?

Apparently, in this Bill, harm is something that is far more wide ranging than any normal
person would possibly define it. While the Bill follows the pattern of the Code previously
drawn, its definition of harm is, itself, deeply concerning.

Of course, if we look to the dictionary, it tells us that “harm” when used as a noun
means:

1. “physical injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted”[3] or
2. Physical or other injury or damage[4]

But harm, according to the Bill, means:

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality,
race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability;

(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;
(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth,
State, Territory or local government institutions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians;
(e) harm to the Australian environment;
(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of
the Australian economy.

First and foremost, using the word “harm” inside its own definition is nonsensical – four
out of six of these defined terms say “harm means harm”. Does the word “harm” in subclause (c) mean the defined term harm, or the ordinary dictionary definition of harm?
The former would make no sense, and simply send us on a neverending roundabout of
the same defined term being used to explain itself. The latter defeats the purpose of
defining “harm” in the first place, and given the requirement for physical injury also
makes no sense.

So right from the outset we have a core drafting problem with the definition.

Given the definition of “harm” is absolutely critical to the foundation of the Bill and its
impact, it is fundamentally important to define it properly, in a way that makes sense.
The drafters have failed to do that, and that isn’t even the biggest problem.

#### Everything is Harm
Even if we can make sense of the defined term at all, it seems that the drafters have
attempted to capture basically everything in the definition of harm.

The topics identified in the defined term “harm” range so widely that arguably any
discussion on any topic of any kind, ever, will ultimately fall within one of the categories.

And if nothing else seems to apply, you can feasibly rely on the stated concern about
harm to the category of “disruption of society in Australia”, whatever that means.

#### What is Serious?
Ah, but surely we are protected from trivial implementations of this mandated Code by
the defined term misinformation requiring a threshold of “serious” harm?

No, we’re not.

Serious, an undefined term, is near impossible to quantify, especially when apparently
something can apparently cause “serious” harm to “society in Australia”.

If I lose, or could lose, $10 is that serious harm to my finances? What if my unemployed
friend who has $15 total in his bank account loses $10 – is that serious?

What about $100? Or $1000?

What if a collection of 1,000 people each lose $10 – is that serious, even though each of
them is completely fine?

If someone gets upset because of something they read, is that harm? What if they get
REALLY REALLY upset?

What is serious is a subjective term, and applying it meaningfully to the word “harm” as
it is used in this Bill is practically impossible. It is open to wide ranging interpretation,

Page 08

and will be subject to the whim of the platform in question and the regulator that
notionally monitors them.

#### Caused or Contributed To
Finally, our definition of misinformation (and disinformation) require the content in
question to “cause or contribute to” serious harm.

The children’s story “Who Sank the Boat” by Pam Allen illustrates the principle well
enough. After the pig, the cow, the donkey and the sheep all alight on the vessel in
question, it remains afloat.

And yet the tiny mouse hops in, and the boat sinks.

Did the mouse “cause” the boat to sink? Probably not.

Did the mouse “contribute” to the boat sinking? Yes.

The threshold of “contributed to” is such a low one that it will be used to capture every
single incidence of content imaginable, irrespective of its reach or impact.

#### The Terms are All Encompassing
Based on these poorly defined terms, the situation the Bill is setting up is that any view
expressed on social media that does not accord with the government view (which, as we
have seen, will inevitably be used as the yardstick of what constitutes misinformation
irrespective of the language used in the Bill itself) on a given topic will be captured by
the legislation.

### Untrustable Tech Companies
The underlying research founded its findings on concepts that:

1. government was trustworthy;
2. authorized news was trustworthy (which is ironic given that media outlets
regularly report completely opposite things);

3. news on social media was not trustworthy.

So it is baffling that the Government is prepared to entrust to technology companies the
process of being arbiters of the concept of information and misinformation.

Page 09


-----

This is despite the fact that these same companies have a demonstrated history of
censoring information that did not accord with their corporate political alignment.

One classic example is the Hunter Biden laptop – a news story that was demonstrably
true, and has since been accepted as such, but was censored across the board by
technology companies in a critical time leading up to the 2020 United States presidential
election.

No justification has been given for how or why these companies are being empowered
in this way.

### The Weaponisation of the Bill
The definition of “harm” hits all the relevant debated political topics that exist now and
will likely exist into the foreseeable future.

Tech companies have a demonstrated history of political bias in one direction or
another.

Governments have made it clear, and this Bill seeks to legislate, that government
intervention and direction about what Tech companies who own these platforms should
and should not allow to be published is acceptable.

Government, of course, is exempt from the operation of the Bill – though it’s not clear
how that can be a functional exemption in circumstances where different individuals
within Government could well hold different views on the relevant topics covered by
“harm”.

It is, however, inevitable that the tools and codes set up by these companies, or if not
those set up by the Government of the day[5], will be utilized to advance a political
agenda. Already we have seen this occurring (together with the relevant platforms’
willingness to cooperate) in the United States.[6]

5 Bearing in mind the Bill allows the ACMA to inflict a Code if one is not implemented or
is not acceptable

This leads us to an inevitable problem – the changing nature of what constitutes
misinformation.

### Today’s Misinformation is Tomorrow’s Fact
_Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia._

We learn things over time. As a result, our views can change. Things we understood to
be true in the past we might now consider to be false. That is the nature of things.

For a few small examples:

   - From the 1930s to the 1950s, tobacco brands recruited medical professionals to
spruik their particular brand of cigarettes to patients and buyers generally as
being entirely fine for you medically. We now understand that was a bad idea.

   - During the pandemic it was widely stated by Governments of Australia, and
some News outlets, as definitive fact, that the COVID-19 vaccines developed in
2020/21 would prevent you from catching the virus. That was not true as we
now understand it.

   - Subsequently, it was stated that while it would not prevent you getting the
virus, it would prevent you spreading it. This, at least in part, was used as the
foundation for many of the restrictions faced by people in this country during
that time. That was also not true as we now understand it.

The Bill, however, seeks to declare an absolute truth at a point in time and require
enforcement and protection of it. It will inevitably be used to silence or prevent public
questioning, interrogation or even contrary hypotheses about the topic in question.

And yet, progression in studies and “truth” have only ever occurred through such
questioning that went against the status quo.

Things that people have taken absolutely for granted at a given point in time are now
considered preposterous by the majority of people on the planet.

What happens to those credible individuals who share contradictory information that
later turns out to be true?

That’s not clear. In the meantime, hopefully their careers and businesses have survived
the implementation of the “code” by the relevant tech company in question.

## Forceful Subjugation Decreases Trust
The reason that public trust of Government is low is because the Government of the day
has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy.

That’s the simple truth.

Every time government spin takes priority over frankness and candour, forceful
positions take priority over reasoned discourse, and name-calling takes priority over
issues – trust decreases even further.

Sadly, however, those things now form the mainstay of government communications.
Spin over candour, force over reason, names over issues.

If the Government wishes to increase public trust, and in doing so offer a real solution to
its concerns about “misinformation and disinformation”, then it should look harder at
itself in the mirror, put more effort into becoming a trustworthy institution, and worry
less about tactics to silence the voices of its own population.
