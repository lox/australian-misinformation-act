# I wish to voice my objection to this Bill. It is onerous; it breaches the Human rights of Australians. In particular the below paragraphs, clearly allow a broad scope of interpretation for manipulation, control and authoritarian censorship.

**_“7 Misinformation and disinformation_**

_(1)For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is misinformation on the digital service if:_
**_(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and”_**

There is no clear definition of false, misleading or deceptive. It is very clear now over the last three
years, that the allegedly reputable sources providing information that was allegedly true and safe,
was subsequently found to be false, harmful and baseless.

Thanks to Liberal Senator for South Australia Alex Antic, we discovered that the Australian
government is a member of a global censorship industrial complex. In December 2022 a request
from Senator Antic under Freedom of Information laws, the secretary of the Department of Home
Affairs Michael Pezzullo revealed on Monday that between January 2017 and December 2022, his
department had referred 13,636 posts to digital platforms such as Facebook, Meta, Twitter,
Instagram and Google to review against their terms of service. Of these, 4,213 were related to Covid.

**Bottom-line, the now proven truths (once deemed misinformation) of scientific evidence, experts**
**in many fields and professional doctors claims were ignored, silenced and censored. The**
**GOVERMENTS and GLOBAL BODIES, deemed their expertise as misinformation all because it was**
**against their agenda.**

**Example 2. Free speech triumphed:** 's stand against AHPRA censorship &

surveillance., an ethically-minded, patient-focused doctor faced unjustified scrutiny

from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Known for her passionate
advocacy of evidence-based, individualised care and her vocal stand against one-size-fits-all health
mandates, found herself in the line of fire, facing prolonged investigations and

potential regulatory action due to anonymous complaints.
AHPRA, despite lacking clear legal grounds, repeatedly requested explanations from

and threatened her professional standing, in response to her questioning and challenging the status
quo in the interest of public health. This problematic behaviour echoed AHPRA's tendency to silence
**any deviation from their prescribed medical communication norms, which threatened their**
**authority and control.**
It's worth noting that is not alone in her plight. A worrying pattern emerged among

medical practitioners, threatened by a publicised memo from AHPRA, which led to fear and were
effectively silenced.
The news is that, following a six-month-long investigation, which encompassed two comprehensive
responses - one of which was a notably extensive letter, the senior investigators from AHPRA,
elected not to proceed further. This marked a significant victory, underlining the defensibility of
**moderated free speech, even in instances of critical discourse regarding official strategy.**

I want the primary means of information showing in our current society to remain censorship free
and to retain open media platforms as a place of ideas so that we do not fall under a corrupt
**hegemonic sphere of influence and control by an internal government or by external international**
**governing bodies.**

The Australian Human Rights has a statuary right to examine this bill as it clearly impedes on
Australian Rights including the covenanted right with international treaty.

Australia has a longstanding commitment to human rights, having been an original signatory to
**the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. The Australian government is committed to**
protecting and promoting traditional rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, opinion,
**religion, association, and movement, through laws at the federal, state, and territory levels, the**
Australian Constitution, and the common law.
“The Proclamation of Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
**Article 19: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom**
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.

# It represents the universal recognition that basic rights and fundamental freedoms are inherent to all human beings, inalienable and equally applicable to everyone, and that every one of us is born free and equal in dignity and rights. Whatever our nationality, place of residence, gender, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status, the international community on December 10 1948 made a commitment to upholding dignity and justice for all of us.
