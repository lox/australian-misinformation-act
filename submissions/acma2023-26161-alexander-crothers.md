**Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinforma�on and disinforma�on (the Communica�ons**
Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023)

Dear officer,

I am wri�ng to express my profound concern at loss of freedom and human rights that the proposed
Australian Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on)
Bill 2023 will bring.

Freedom of expression and freedom to hear and boldly voice contrarian opinions, expression and
thought, and to openly debate ideas is the bedrock of a free, democra�c, scien�fic and civilized
country and society.

**Statement of Compa�bility**
I call on the Department to immediately, under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scru�ny) Act 2011,
release publicly the required Statement of Compa�bility which must accompany new Bills. The
statement must assess the compa�bility of the proposed legisla�on with the rights and freedoms
recognised in the seven core interna�onal human rights trea�es that Australia has ra�fied, including
the ICCPR.

Very simply put the Bill allows the ACMA too much power and I fundamentally oppose this Bill.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr Alexander Crothers.
