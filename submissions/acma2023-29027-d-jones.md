## Proposed new ACMA powers to combat misinformation & disinformation.

The announcement by the Minister for Communications that the Australian Government
would introduce new laws to provide the independent regulator, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat (noting the use
of military terminology here) ‘online misinformation and disinformation’ is totally and utterly
laughable.

If anything, it only seeks to further wrap the un-democratic tentacles of socialism /
communism around Australia’s throat by seeking to silence an intelligent, transparent, and
educated debate on topics impacting Australians – at the hands of a very controlled,
conditioned, and conflict-ridden few.

How on earth does any department or political establishment come up with the idea that
placing the ‘decision-making’ on what is appropriate and what is not for the 27 million people
in Australia, in the hands of only 6 people is a good idea?? You have got to be joking (that, or
_our entire political leadership is going for the title of ‘WEF groupie of the Year’)._

The exclusion of the Government, it’s funded (& complicit) educational institutions, presstitue
(erm, I mean professional) media, and international governments and their approved (i.e.
funded) educational bodies is also utter nonsense.

_(So glad to hear the WHO, WEF, UN, IMF etc. will be included … Yeah right.)_

To add to that, let’s look at what the last 3 years have proven.

Government has without doubt been THE SINGLE BIGGEST perpetrator of fake narratives,
misleading information, and disinformation – and HARM to the Australian people. The ‘safe &
effective’ mantra is just one of many which was relentlessly pushed down our throats (using
tax-payer dollars), which dissident voices – strongly censored, de-platformed and victimised
(at the request of Government) – continued to challenge, show concern for, and disprove
time & time again.

(And let’s not look into the ‘harm’ caused by Government misinformation and disinformation
as evidenced by the National Excess Mortality Statistics. Heck no… that would only open a
massive can of worms the Minister for Health couldn’t wheedle his way out of).

Given the passage of time, it has come to be proven that the majority of information deemed
‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ by the Government and professional media over the last
few years was in fact CORRECT (i.e. NOT misinformation or disinformation).

Now we have ‘the Voice’ – an ill-constructed stab at the Constitution which seeks to entitle
ethically & morally questionable politicians the push their own agendas (and that of their
global masters) even further – and the ‘achieving target inflation is good for Australian’s’
narrative, at the expense of every Australian - again.

SO… When you say you want even MORE power to monitor and silence those scientists,
doctors, researchers, critical thinkers, entrepreneurs, independent and ‘actual’ journalists
(not those Mockingbird news-shills you see on the MSM), specialists and others that actually
work for a living in the industries up for debate… So that six (6) bureaucrats sitting in cushy
Government jobs with virtually no experience in the topics they are making decisions on can
determine what is ‘true’ and what is not – we say…

NO. NO. NO. NO…. and NO. And maybe a few more NO’s.

Anytime Government gets involved in something, it stuffs it up! Period. The end.

That, and the whole industry of ‘Fact Checking’ involves a bunch of shills who align with the
highest bidder - not the ‘truth’.  Yes, we can do our homework on who owns the ‘fact
checkers’ and who benefits from the ‘views’ they provide.

SUMMARY:

Let the people decided what is right and what is wrong – FOR THEMSELVES.

And let the social-media platforms provide an avenue for FREE SPEECH so this world can
continue to expose corruption, greed, misinformation, and disinformation as a collective.

Even if you don’t like it – the very existence of Free Speech is critical to our democracy. It
means you get to have your say, I get to have mine, and no-one has to agree with anyone!
We are simply entitled to our thoughts, our opinions, and our voices - and entitled to accept
or ignore that of others. It’s a beautiful concept that works effortlessly.

Let all Australians employ critical thinking, triangulate their sources of information, hear from
both sides of the argument, do their own research, consider who is financially or otherwise
motivated to present a certain narrative (following the money is always enlightening), and
make their own mind up on what is in front of them.

The Minister isn’t seeking to combat misinformation and disinformation – he is seeking to do
his part to implement Communist rule (including, heaven forbid, the requirement for
individuals to ‘incriminate’ themselves). One cut at a time to the throats of the Australian
people, businesses, and international entities that once wanted to do business here.

Australia is fast becoming a country to ‘leave’ and risks becoming a banana republic should
Government over-reach such as this EVER be allowed to see the light of day. It is utterly
ridiculous that someone PAID by the people of Australia to represent THEM has wasted his
time and our hard-earned cash with a BS proposal like this.

One last comment, “If the ACMA registers a misinformation code, digital platform providers
in the relevant section of the digital platform industry must comply with the code” is the
biggest load of garbage I have ever heard.

The world has had enough of centralised governments and NGO’s trying to censor, control,
and program the people and their businesses into submission.

This proposed Legislation MUST NOT be allowed to see the light of day…

(UNLESS – ALL GOVERNMENT’s, MEDIA, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, OVERSEAS
INSTITUTIONS, and other currently excluded entities are unequivocally included).

I really hope Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Adam Mosseri etc. have sent a really loud and
ridiculously clear ‘F**K YOU’ message to the Australian Government over this one.

Yours in health and happiness,
D Jones
