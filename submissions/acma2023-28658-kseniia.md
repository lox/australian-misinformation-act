To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to make a submission on the proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment
(Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.

I believe this bill is a threat to Australian democracy and human rights, will mark an end to free
speech in Australia and will significantly limit government accountability. This bill will give
extraordinary powers to the government which in turn would be the ul�mate authority of truth. No
government should ever have such powers. Australians are able to think for themselves and analyse
informa�on independent of the government. We do not need a subjec�ve standard to be imposed
on us that would ul�mately define what people can and cannot say.

The defini�on of ‘misinforma�on’ and ‘disinforma�on in the Bill is so broad that it could capture
many statements made by Australians that are deemed problema�c for the government or the
mainstream narra�ve. For example, journalists commen�ng on digital pla�orms could have their
content removed as misinforma�on if ACMA decides it is misinforma�on; ordinary Australians will
not be able to make any comments on poli�cal maters for the fear of being silenced, blocked, or
fined. The defini�on of harm is also subjec�ve and quite vague under the bill. If the Minister has
favoured a par�cular digital pla�orm, then the pla�orm could be removed from the applica�on of
the bill, which is nothing else but a double standard. The government will be able to enforce any
ideology it seems fit, which will destroy free speech and democracy. ACMA will gain extraordinary
powers and might require any Australian to appear by their request at a �me and place to answer
ques�ons about a post or message they deemed as misinforma�on or disinforma�on.

This bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the public
square with no accountability or transparency. I cannot help but draw a comparison between what
will happen in Australia under this bill and what was happening in the Soviet Union under the
communist regime. The impacts of this bill will be devasta�ng.

This bill does not provide a sufficient standard of oversight and accountability for misuse of
censorship powers. The fact that the government-authorised content is excluded from the
censorship regime is hypocri�cal. The bill is also inconsistent with Australia’s interna�onal human
rights obliga�ons such as the Interna�onal Covenant on Civil and Poli�cal Rights as well as the UN
Declara�on of Human Rights.

The severity of the penal�es for failing to comply with the ACMA codes and standards is excessive
and can account to millions of dollars for digital pla�orm providers. That will inherently limit free
speech and freedom of expression.

I, therefore, oppose this bill.

Kind Regards
