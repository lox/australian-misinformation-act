In reading this bill and guidance notes I have had to stop and shake my head at almost everything I
have read. It seems to be the most misguided, Un-Australian and completely foreign bill I have ever
seen, with no upsides. For example, in “Table 4: Key examples of what is in scope of the ACMA
powers” it states “Unauthorised electoral or referendum content that is disinformation” is in scope.

Who will be in charge of “Authorising” electoral or referendum content? Silencing people at any
kind of election or referendum can only lead to an abuse of power and a dictatorship, a truly
terrifying thought.

Table 4 also states that “Digital platform services (excluding services in clause 6)” are in scope.
This includes search engines, news aggregators, instant messaging services, social media, webforums, dating sites, online peer-to-peer marketplaces and podcasting services (with an interactive
feature).

So, news must be “authorised” to be able to be shared, or it could be classed as disinformation,
removing all freedom of speech. Even dating sites.. is the Australian government really so
concerned that a women said she was thirty six when she is actually forty, or a man said he was 6
feet tall, when he is really only 5.7.. What kind of place will Australia become with such overreach
into peoples personal lives, I shudder to think.

“Table 1: Harms” categorises “Harm” as “Hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis
of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental
disability”.

However people have a god given right to religious freedom, If a Jewish Rabbi was to quote
publicly online was is stated in his holy scriptures, such as - Leviticus 18:22 “Thou shalt not lie
with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination”, Should this be considered “Hate Speech”
that causes “Harm” against the homosexual community, thus removing the Rabbi’s right to religious
practice and expression?. I can only then see this bill as antisemitic and discriminatory.

I have read this bill and seen no upside. I do not support this bill in any capacity. I see this bill and
extremely dangerous and believe it should be scrapped forthwith. I would also like to see where this
bill was drafted by the will of the constituents of the commonwealth of Australia. I don't believe it
was.

I do not support this bill.
