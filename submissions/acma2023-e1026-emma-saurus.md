Submission regarding the Exposure Draft Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting
Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023 (Misinformafion Bill)

I object to the Misinformafion Bill on the bases that:

1. The Misinformafion Bill interferes with High Court–established freedoms of polifical
communicafion.

2. In its voluntary form (the Australian Code of Pracfice on Disinformafion and Misinformafion
– the Voluntary Code), it has already been used to remove and suppress informafion that
was and is factually correct.

3. The proposed legislafion seems designed to censor public discourse, exposing the Australian
people to extreme risk from this and future governments by removing instruments of
government accountability.

4. Penalfies for digital plafforms that fail to monitor and suppress informafion idenfified by
government authorifies will have an unreasonably harmful effect on businesses that
facilitate communicafion.

The draft Misinformafion Bill represents an aftack on freedom of polifical communicafion, which has
been established as essenfial to democracy by the High Court.[1] The Australian Human Rights
Commission asserts that:

the High Court has held that an implied freedom of polifical communicafion exists as an
indispensable part of the system of representafive and responsible government created by
the Consfitufion. It operates as a freedom from government restraint […][ibid]

The Department of Home Affairs and the Health Department have already admifted to requesfing
the removal of factual informafion contradicfing government policy.[2] In more than 4,200 instances,
the policy contradicted was the asserfion that Covid-19 vaccinafions are and were “safe and
effecfive”. These incidents serve as a recent example of the abuse of the Voluntary Code to suppress
truthful informafion and valid opinions; expanding the applicafion of the code and the power of its
enforcers will create an Orwellian situafion where truth is defined by government policy rather than
the open considerafion of evidence.

The argument that Covid-related informafion was suppressed to prevent harms is contradicted by
the data showing massively increased presentafions to hospital emergency rooms[3] in the months
following Covid vaccine roll-outs – in the case of Western Australia,[4] in the absence of circulafing
coronavirus. Such data supports the argument that the vaccines caused harms comparable to Covid19, but in an age group that was not at significant risk of Covid-19 complicafions. Due to the
imposifion of mandates and aggressive promofional campaigns, various State governments, in
concert with the Federal government, can be seen as directly responsible for those recorded harms
against the Australian people.

Under your proposed Misinformafion Bill, the above informafion and reasonable opinion would be
tracked and removed, with penalfies for the digital plafform and no prospect of holding government
agencies accountable for their role in this debacle.


-----

The Misinformafion Bill will harm Australians’ freedom of polifical communicafion. It will harm
Australians’ ability to hold government agencies accountable for wrongdoing. It will further facilitate
the suppression of government crificism. The imposifion of penalfies will freeze and harm businesses
facilitafing communicafion.

I urge the rejecfion of the Misinformafion Bill in its enfirety as being against the interests of the
Australian people and the health of democracy in Australia.
