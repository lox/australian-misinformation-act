COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING MISINFORMATION &
DISINFORMATION) Exposure Draft BILL 2023
– Proposed new powers for the Australian Communications & Media Authority (ACMA)

I strongly object to the idea that the public interest is in anyway served by the substance and
intent of this Draft Bill, for the following reasons:

1. Freedom of speech is a hard-won human right and is enshrined in the U.S.

Constitution for good reason. The First Amendment provides that Congress protects
freedom of speech, the press, assembly and the right to petition the Government for
a redress of grievances. Australia has no such necessary protections.
This Bill has the potential to erode that right.

2. At a time of political dissatisfaction and dissent such as these times, governments

must seek to represent the peoples’ interest to regain their legitimacy and right to
govern rather than by suppressing, punishing or persecuting dissenters.

At the Nuremberg Trial, ‘Crimes against humanity’ included persecutions carried out
for political reasons in which vilification of dissidents played a large part. Highranking Nazi leader Hermann Goering said that the common people can always be
manipulated into supporting and fighting wars by their political leaders. “All you have
_to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of_
_patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any_
_country”.  Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s Minister for Public Enlightenment and_
Propaganda, said, ‘If you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it, and you will
_even come to believe it yourself.  A democracy must allow all views to be heard._

The Australian people are generally cynical about their political class as they watch
their living standards collapse under pressure of inept monetary policy and lack of
productive skilled jobs.

This is in direct contrast to President F.D. Roosevelt’s (FDR) message, “The only
_thing we have to fear is fear itself”. FDR’s solution to the menace of fascist_
repression was to build the optimism of a productive economy beginning with broadscale infrastructure development. Australia should do the same.

This Draft ACMA Bill has broad powers which would enable the government to
mandate persecution of those whose views on economic policy solutions differ from
their own, a risk Australia cannot afford to take. Debate on these matters is healthy,
not a threat as implied in this Bill.

3. The proposed Bill excludes the Government from its punitive powers. The idea that

the Government be the arbiter of ‘truth’ is abhorrent and clearly disproven by the
recent record of lies and unjust invasions propagated by Western Powers to justify
war and ‘regime change’ – There was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction
(yellow cake) in Iraq under Saddam Hussein who was a secular leader opposed to Al
Qaeda, despite Prime Minister John Howard’s disproven stance; atrocities were also
committed against long-standing Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddaffi who was
demonised in the lead up to his public slaughter, the country formerly wealthy, now
devastated; attempted regime change in al-Assad led Syria, yet Bashar al-Assad
presents as a mild-mannered man concerned for his people’s interest above all else,
not shown lately in our media; while with the destruction of Afghanistan and its
people over decades, including American and Australian war crimes and its opium

growing role for Western markets - now the Taliban has plenty of American weapons
at its disposal and has returned the country to a cultural dark age.
With this record it is no wonder that Russia’s leader Putin does not trust the Western
powers’ empty promises of ensuring food security via Crimea port, also on basis of
the U.N.’s broken 2014 Minsk security agreement of a buffer zone in Eastern
Ukraine.
Under this proposed ACMA Bill, the risk is that I be targeted, and penalised, as a
dangerous dissident for my views stated here, according to the dictates of the
U.S./U.K. AUKUS deal which targets China and expects Australia to follow suit.

This Bill has potential to overturn the public’s right to protest against another
unjustified war.

4. We are currently being primed for a proxy-war on behalf of the United States against

China, just as Ukraine has been used as proxy against Russia with an early
negotiated peace agreement undermined by the West. But China is our biggest
trading partner and is promoting ‘win-win’ economic development for all countries.
What then is our national and sovereign interest?

Sovereignty is counter to the ‘rules based order’, promoted by Morrison and now PM
Albanese which affirms the international standard-setting bodies (largely American or
British), “which create rules (regarding) Australia’s security, interests, values and
_prosperity”. Sounds like Doublespeak to me, like, ‘war is peace’ and ‘freedom is_
slavery’, or the ‘Newspeak’ state-imposed control of language, as identified in the
anti-totalitarianism book by George Orwell, 1984.  Orwell could see it coming:
Totalitarianism, Dictatorship, Corporate dominance of governments (Fascism
according to Mussolini), a ‘New World Order’ which is ‘not new and not order’, and a
subservient cowed population.

Some more relevant quotes from FDR:

“The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who
have much, it is whether we provided enough for those who have little.”
“Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to
choose wisely, the real safeguard of democracy therefore, is education.”
“In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned
that way.”

FDR knew that freedom of thought, speech and movement underlie our democratic
freedoms and must be safeguarded at all costs. He also understood the political methods
which may be used by think-tanks serving the Military Industrial Complex to control
governments and what the people think (planning and propaganda) to ensure political
agendas such as the drive for war are met.

Let’s not go down the road of fear, a cowed media, and thought-control (Orwell’s
‘doublethink’) overseen by a government which wants to manipulate and control the people
for dubious ends like staying in power for the sake of power itself. It can only end badly with
an underground movement whose rebellion stems from collapse of their individual living
standards, rapidly unfolding, an opposition which would only be reinforced by such dictatorial
methods used by government.

In sum, I respectfully ask the Senators reviewing the proposed ACMA Bill to throw it out in its
entirety to ensure full freedom of speech of the population as they seek to educate the
political class in how best they may represent the country’s interests. This is a bad Bill.
