**SUBMISSION**

**Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment**
**(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023**

I have serious concerns over the scope and very nature of this Bill. Put simply, it is overreach by the
government.

In this submission I identify the following concerns and issues:

1. Australia is a democracy, and our core defining values, amongst others, include _‘freedom_ _of_
_speech,_ _expression_ _and_ _religious_ _belief^_ _.We_ can not genuinely exercise these freedoms if
government effectively controls what our speech on a digital service is allowed to contain.
Obviously, there is no place for hate speech, and the government, appropriately, have existing
laws and protections in place to combat hate speech. But the draft Bill goes much further than
just hate speech, as it effectively silences any speech that is deemed as misinformation and
disinformation by the government.

2. Under subclause 7(1) and 7(2) of the Bill, _misinformation_ and _disinformation_ are defined, in
part, as ‘content containing] information that is false, misleading or deceptive’. But how and
who decides ‘false’, ‘misleading’ or ‘deceptive’ content? Is this by elected or unelected
government officials and if so, how are these people above reproach when it comes to
misinformation and disinformation? How is truth decided, by which the thoughts and opinions
expressed online of everyday Australians will be regulated? There are many unanswered
questions which the Bill does not provide answers for.

3. I draw your attention to another alarming aspect of this Bill: exemptions made for ‘professional
news content’ and ‘authorised’ government content. This leads to the obvious question of why
are these two entities exempt from the very things the Bill seeks to stamp out? Does the same
standard, applied to everyone else, not also apply to news media and government? History
speaks volumes on incidents where news media and government have not told the truth, and
disseminated, at best, misinformation. This double-standard exposes some serious hypocrisy.
Furthermore, it does not bode well that a quick Google search reveals opinion polls and articles
about how regularly Australian’s do not trust politicians and government departments.

4. The Bill shuts down genuine, healthy discussion and debate by silencing all other arguments
and opinions at odds with the government’s narrative. Rather than seeking to oppress voices
which are at odds with the ‘approved’ truth, we should be encouraging the diversity of views
and opinions shared on digital platforms, which generates robust debate and ultimately (and
hopefully), much improved outcomes.

5. Finally, the Bill fails to provide protections for valid expression of opinion or belief. There must
be clear and defined limits on what speech is and is not acceptable, and the Bill must provide a
sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of censorship powers.

This saying exists for a reason: _do_ _not_ _trust_ _everything_ _you_ _read_ _or_ _hear_ _on_ _the_ _internet._ It is not the
place of government to make this decision on behalf of Australians. We see the tragic fruits of these
kind of oppressed societies where communist governments dictate what is true. It is our very
democratic system of government and our valuing of free of speech that attracts so many people
seeking asylum here. I fear this Bill is a step towards an oppressive government, which is at odds with
the Australian democracy.

In conclusion, this Bill, masquerading as providing ‘protection for Australians’, will do little of the sort.
Instead, it seeks to censor conflicting voices and opinions, stifle debate, define its own ‘truth’ and
hypocritically, exempt professional news media and authorised government content from the same
standards imposed on everyone else. And most dangerously, it takes away the freedom of speech and
expression, a core value of Australian democracy.

I urge the Government to scrap this Bill as it is a blatant attack on freedom of speech.

Thank you for your time in reading my submission and I ask that the concerns I have raised on this matter
be genuinely considered.
