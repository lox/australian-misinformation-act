I write to submit my feedback on the draft bill titled "Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". I am deeply concerned and outraged
by the implications of this bill.

Firstly, the existence of this bill raises serious doubts about the government's commitment to
upholding the freedom of speech of Australian citizens. By creating two classes of citizens, with
one having the power to spread potentially false or misleading information online while the other
group is restricted, the bill undermines the principles of a fair and democratic society.

Furthermore, I firmly believe that the Internet is a powerful tool for democracy, giving regular
people a voice and empowering them to express their views. However, this bill poses a
significant risk to the ability of ordinary citizens to participate in public discourse. The imposition
of excessive fines will force digital services to become more restrictive and censor speech to an
extent that surpasses even the strictest platforms today.

One of the fundamental flaws of this bill is the impossible task of accurately determining what is
true or false. History has shown us that scientific consensus can change over time, and
information once considered factual can later be proven false. By criminalizing the
dissemination of information that may later be deemed false, this bill stifles open and honest
debates, preventing the search for truth and hindering progress.

The inclusion of true information that is deemed misleading or deceptive in the scope for
removal is deeply concerning. Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of any democratic society as
it allows for open discussions and the exchange of ideas. It is through this process that common
ground is found and truth is established. By limiting the ability to express diverse viewpoints, this
bill undermines the principles upon which our democracy stands.

Even experts are raising serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. Dr. Nick
Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has publicly criticized the
legislation, stating that the accusation of misinformation is thrown so readily that implementing
such a law would inevitably lead to fines being levied on information that is not false. If an expert
in the field raises such concerns, it calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of this bill.

Moreover, the broad definitions used in this bill inadvertently bring thousands of community
websites, including smaller platforms and independent media organizations, under its scope.
This lack of specificity and consideration for smaller websites and their potential legal risks
imposes an unreasonable restriction on freedom of speech and enterprise.

The proposed legislation also delegates significant lawmaking power to private entities, which
are not directly responsible to Parliament. This circumvention of parliamentary checks and
balances is an abdication of the fundamental legislative power granted to Parliament.

Additionally, the Bill's definition of harm and the potentially broad prohibition on content that
causes harm raise concerns about the violation of Australians' constitutional freedom of political
communication. Matters of public policy, scientific investigation, and debate are highly contested
among political parties and interest groups. Limiting legitimate discussions on these matters
unjustly curtails our constitutional freedom of expression.

This bill assumes that the government and its affiliated institutions are the sole arbiters of truth,
dismissing the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians. In doing so, it denies the
diversity of perspectives necessary for a comprehensive sense-making process.

Lastly, the threats and impositions on digital platform providers and ordinary users are
concerning. The potential consequences, including reputational damage, financial penalties,
and business inefficiencies, undermine the principles of fair and free communication that our
democracy upholds. Moreover, the requirement for citizens to report on their friends, family, or
political co-agitants raises concerns about the erosion of trust and the erosion of our cherished
Australian value of mateship.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 is deeply flawed and risks infringing upon our freedom of speech and
democratic principles. I urge the Department to reconsider the provisions of this bill and take
into account the concerns raised by various stakeholders. It is essential that any legislation
seeking to address misinformation and disinformation does not curtail our right to freedom of
speech or interfere with the diverse and robust public discourse that is the foundation of our
democracy.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the concerns
raised by citizens and work towards a more balanced and democratic approach to combatting
misinformation and disinformation.

Yours sincerely,
