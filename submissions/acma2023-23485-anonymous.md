Letter To ACMA

To whom it may concern.

This bill goes against many of our rights to have freedom of speech and freedom of expression,
(Section 16 of the Human Rights Act 2004) Everyone has the right to hold opinions without
interference. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in this country.

The corporate government should not even be entertaining the idea of given the power to ACMA
by our elected priminister to invoke a Authoritarian bill that if implemented will be the loss of our
human rights to have freedom of speech. This bill would amount to treason to the women, men and
children of this country.

To stop freedom of speech in this country based on keeping us safe,using terms disinformation,
misinformation and hate is a dangerous rout to be going down, we do not need government
corporations censoring alternate facts.

If this bill passes and the only avenues of supposed truth comes from corporate governance and
mainstream media how do we know that the supposed truth can be trusted. Who are the
adjudicators of this truth, what processes have they used in vetting this truth.

Does this corporate government truth have conflicts of interest where the sources of the truth are
being paid by vested interests, as we know some groups now are being offered community grants by
federal government to vote yes in the voice to parliament.

As we have seen in the last 3 years the suppression of opposing experts and facts from alternative
resources other then the corporate governments and corporate mainstream media, has left a lot of
Australians worse off.

As it turns out there was a lot of saturation of information from corporate governments, mainstream
media, media celebrity Drs that turned out to be misinformation or disinformation. What did the
corporate governments do nothing but try and sweep it under the mate.

There was a abundance of facts from high ranking Drs that were not allowed to have there voices
herd by politicians, governments and mainstream media and were also attacked with out even
allowing for debate.

This resulted in Australians not having Access to other forms of medications as those forms of
medications were denounced by the same mainstream media and politicians that will be the only
ones to give us the supposed truth if this bill is passed.

Now we are meant to trust the same corporations governments and so called experts to tell us the
truth going forward with no access to opposing facts.

In my book they call that communism when the corporate governments and the state owned media
ABC and paid mainstream media will only allow one side of the story, as there supposed facts will
not be fact checked by the the paid fact checkers who are more then likely been paid for by
governments tax payers money.

To deny Australian people the opportunity to have access to opposing facts, evidence and opinions
from anyone regardless of there profession and their expertise is total suppression of a balanced
debate.

For example the current federal government are reluctant to give details on the voice to parliament
and how it will effect ordinary Australians, until after the referendum is complete, is that not
suppression of information.

At the moment there are real facts that are telling us that a lot of the Aboriginal Elders have not
been considered or consulted in this process and will be voting no to the voice.

Why aren’t theses Aboriginal Elders been given the opportunity to speak against the voice, why
aren’t they being aired on mainstream media and allowing the majority of Australians to see that
there are two sides to the story, if it’s like this now it will be 10 times worse if this bill is passed.

We have the WHO treaty coming up in May 2024 if not earlier possibly this November 2023 to
finalise the pandemic treaty amendments which includes handing over our sovereignty, all public
healthcare including, forced vaccinations, quarantine and pandemic preparedness to a unelected
group of bureaucrats that meet in Davos.

These amendments can be found in Proposed Amendments to the International Health Regulations
(2005) submitted in accordance with decision WHA75(9) (2022).

Why is this not being reporting on channel 7, 9, or the state funded ABC, the same media outlets
that will be the only source of supposed truth with this Bill. My ability to be able to attain this


-----

information spread this information and any other factual information will be squashed if this Bill is
passed.

I as a parent I have a obligation to my children’s future grandchildren, my neighbours children and
the broader community and the men and women who died for this country freedoms to stand up
and questions any government bills that are detrimental to our freedoms going forward.

As it stands the last three years have shown me and the community that our freedoms and liberties
have been taken from us under the guise of keeping us safe, we as adults do not need governments
interfering in our ever lives as it stands the corporate governments know everything about us, but
we know little about them.

Politicians and government departments are meant to be public servants who serve-the public and
community for the betterment of the public, this is not the case as it stands.

If the government are confident in their democratic process for example with regards to the voice
referendum why do the feel the need to suppress information that goes against there narrative if
there is nothing to hide.

This goes for any bills, treaty’s or any government legislation going forward we need full
transparency and open debates so the Australian public can have both sides of the story and make a
balanced decision.

Kind Regards
