 Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I am totally opposed to the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 providing the ACMA with
powers to regulate online information for the following main reasons:

1. It is a gross abuse of our right to free speech. This right is a fundamental pillar of our democracy and

many other freedoms that we have enjoyed and fought to protect for hundreds of years. The
government has no reasonable role to play in attempting to regulate what may be shared online
based on vague assessments of "truth" and "harm".

2. Who will be the final arbiter of "truth"? It is very clear from events over the last few years that the

government cannot be trusted to determine what is true and what is not. In the past determination
of truth has prevailed after robust debate and even if consensus is never achieved, individuals are
left to make their own determination based on evidence provided. Even our judicial system at it's
core is based on a group of individuals reaching a joint conclusion (by jury) rather than a decision by
a faceless so-called "fact-checker" who lacks even the slightest appearance of being free from a
"conflict of interest".

3. Who will assess "serious harm" in this context? A significant number of our community consider that

the government itself has caused immeasurable harm to society over the last few years with
business failures, mental health issues, relationship damage, injury and death caused by invasive
pandemic response measures and a "one size fits all" medical intervention which forced people out
of jobs etc. How on earth can we trust the government to properly assess harm after all of this? Why
have they already been so unsuccessful in dealing with the harm caused to our community by online
pornography?

4. Unfair application of the proposed law. Apparently, the government and accredited media are

exempt from the restrictions of the bill. This obviously means that the government and media can
spread online misinformation with impunity. On what planet is this seen to be "fair"? Obviously, the
government and media are regarded as always being right and truthful. Who in their right mind
expects the ordinary man in the street to swallow this?

5. Unfair and unrealistic implementation of the proposed law. Given the amount of information that is

put online (on any server anywhere in the world) it would be impossible to legislate for service
providers to comply with an Australian law to "fact-check" every piece of information posted. It will
obviously be expected to work on a "complaints" basis where presumably anyone could question the
"truth" of a statement and raise a complaint which would then be forwarded to the service provider.
It is incomprehensible to consider how this would work in a general sense. Perhaps for a few of the
big online services (Meta, Twitter[or is it 'X' now?], YouTube, etc.) there might be some avenue to
process a complaint (tested and refined in the last few years) but the reach is unlikely to extend
much further in practice and many have already migrated to other platforms which will completely
ignore any attempts by authoritarian regimes to regulate content. All of this is also ignoring the
ability of online content generators to devise technical workarounds to the regulation of online
content. In addition, the implementation costs of this futile exercise will be borne by the taxpayer
and the end user of online services.

6. Attempts to restrict basic human rights of free speech will cause civil disobedience and further

erosion of trust in government institutions. The harm this will cause to our society will eclipse any
potential "harm" caused by the "misinformation and disinformation" this bill seeks to regulate. Any
part-time student of history will quickly realise that this bill is a typical totalitarian tool to control the
official narrative and implement censorship on a grand scale.

A healthy, democratic society is based on a free exchange of ideas that provide for individual responsibility
and mutual respect. This proposed bill is in direct opposition to this principle, and I call on the government
to drop it completely.
