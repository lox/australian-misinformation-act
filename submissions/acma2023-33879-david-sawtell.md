I put forward this submission, to express the grave concerns I hold in regard to the proposed
“Misinformation and Disinformation Bill”.

While I share concerns in regard to dangerous misinformation, I believe seeking to cancel or censor
such deliberate or ill-informed material, rather than addressing it with debate, is liable to proliferate
further rumour and speculation.

This proposed bill treats the public with contempt, assuming Australians to be incapable of
determining which information is and is not correct. Worse if passed into law this bill would reduce
the ability of individuals to make informed determinations.

Worse still this bill excludes government and media from scrutiny. This is extremely dangerous, these
bodies are as fallible to error as any other party, and are liable to contribute to misinformation to cover
mistakes or to achieve political bias.

The predominant social media platforms are all hosted offshore, placing the onus for content
censorship onto these platforms effectively becomes political interference. Australia is just one small
market for these platforms, they are liable to make rash broad-brush measures to satisfy impositions
from Australia, and or impose geo-blocks withdrawing Australian access. Proposed penalties are
ludicrous, excessive, and unlikely to be affected upon parties operating from outside of our borders.

The proposed bill is full of open language making interpretation able to vary to suit the bias of whatever
individual or body is implementing it. That may not be a concern with a government you favour but
could well be with a future government you do not agree with.

The assertion that I am unable to discern the validity of any piece of information, from any source is
insulting to me, and as such I implore that this bill be scrapped in full. We do not need ever more
government interference and intrusion into our lives. The only beneficiaries of this legislation are those
too lazy or whose arguments are too feeble to sustain debate.

Sincerely

David Sawtell
