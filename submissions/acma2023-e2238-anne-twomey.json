    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The legislation poses a risk to free speech by potentially suppressing alternative views and imposing a single view of 'truth'.",
      "The definitions of misinformation and disinformation are confusing and problematic, particularly concerning 'excluded content'.",
      "The legislation could lead to censorship of material regardless of its provenance, including 'excluded content'.",
      "The ACMA's role in determining misinformation and disinformation could lead to conflicts and inconsistencies.",
      "The legislation may burden the implied freedom of political communication and could be constitutionally invalid.",
      "The bill could exacerbate harm by being used by malicious actors to spread misinformation more widely."

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "There is a very real risk that such decisions may result in the suppression or deletion of alternative views on digital platforms and impose a single view of ‘truth’ in Australia.",
      "Parliament should take into consideration, therefore, that the likely effect of its legislation will be the censorship of material regardless of its provenance, including ‘excluded content’.",
      "The regime proposed by this Bill could be used by malicious actors for the purpose of spreading misinformation more widely than it might otherwise reach, resulting in greater harm.",
      "This exposure draft Bill is at best half-baked. While one can sympathise with its aim, it is hard to believe that anyone has seriously thought through how it would operate in practice and the likely consequences."
