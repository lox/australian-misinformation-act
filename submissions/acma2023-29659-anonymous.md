The Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill
2023 is a deeply concerning piece of legisla�on that poses significant risks to freedom of speech
and independent journalism. The bill's broad and ambiguous language raises serious concerns
about poten�al government overreach and censorship. By gran�ng authori�es the power to
determine what cons�tutes "misinforma�on" and "disinforma�on," the bill could be easily
manipulated to silence dissen�ng voices, s�fle independent journalism, and curtail legi�mate
public discourse. Moreover, the lack of clear safeguards and oversight mechanisms further
exacerbates fears of abuse of power. Instead of promo�ng open and informed public debate, this
bill threatens to create an environment of fear and self-censorship, undermining the very
principles of democracy it claims to protect. As ci�zens, we must defend our right to access diverse
informa�on and viewpoints, and this bill removes our fundamental democra�c values.

I will not accept any restric�ons on my freedom of speech. This bill should be cast aside and
replaced with one which enshrines our right to freedom of speech in law. Free speech is an
indispensable pillar of any democra�c society, fostering an environment where individuals can
express their thoughts, ideas, and opinions without fear of retribu�on. The right to free speech not
only promotes open dialogue but also enables the exchange of diverse perspec�ves, leading to
innova�on and societal progress. It empowers individuals to challenge prevailing norms, ques�on
authority, and advocate for change, ul�mately promo�ng social jus�ce and human rights.
Moreover, free speech is crucial for holding governments accountable, as it allows ci�zens to voice
concerns and demand transparency from their elected representa�ves. By safeguarding free
speech, we safeguard the principles of democracy, individual autonomy, and the pursuit of truth.
In embracing free speech, we embrace the essence of a free and pluralis�c society, where
everyone has the opportunity to be heard and contribute to a more inclusive and enlightened
world.
