Minister Michelle Rowland proposes powers that would:


enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or require them to keep certain records about
matters regarding misinformation and disinformation


plus


allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation), should a code of practice be
deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.


The matter of TRUTH and FACTS needs to be at the forefront of anything regarding misinformation.

In hindsight -- the facts now reveal that the health ministers, chief medical officers, conflicted academics, the media, and
politicians have been the BIGGEST purveyors of MISINFORMATION and DISINFORMATION. We could list probably 1000
examples over the years… from weapons of mass destruction, ivermectin is for horses, to vaccines are safe.

We were told the vaccines were “safe”. And the government and it’s agencies are still pushing this ‘safe’ so-called vaccine
despite 1291 side effects (including death) confirmed by Pfizer. The ‘vaccines’ are not safe. I can personally confirm that 50%
of my extended family had serious and not so serious adverse events – from, for example, myocarditis, bleeding tonsils,
excruciating and debilitating pain in legs, inability to breathe properly, etc. It is catastrophic … and for the government and
health departments to deny the injury and harm caused by these experimental ‘vaccines’ is gross misinformation that has
directly HARMED AUSTRALIANS.

We now know that excess deaths correlate with the vaccines – beyond the 80 year average.

Plus:

  - ivermectin was safe for humans but is no longer safe — it’s for horses now – despite over 90 studies proving it

effective.

  - that athletes dying suddenly on the field at 30 from cardiac failure is not misinformation

  - that boosters are better than your immune system is counter to science and is misinformation

  - that Covid-19 was a planned pandemic is misinformation – then could the minister please explain why Australia spent

$55 million on “Covid-19 PCR tests” in 2017 and 18.

  - that Covid-19 was from the lab is misinformation – then could the minister please explain the evidence of the Covid
19 patents

We are told to believe the FACT CHECKERS… We are expected to believe that a 22-year-old Fact Checker
(instructed by a political or corporate shadow) is more qualified to assess medical misinformation than, say, a
group of 100 doctors representing 2,500 years of medical experience.

It is unacceptable.

The last few years of bogus fact checkers and political bias to support the vaccine industry has destroyed democracy and has
directly HARMED Australians.

All the MISINFORMATION by government, ABC and media, and health organisations need to be identified, logged and
investigated.

The ACMA needs to get INDEPENDENT transparent and proper scientists and doctors to determine in the first instance what is
fact… so that truth can prevail. Those in government propagating misinformation should be held to account.
