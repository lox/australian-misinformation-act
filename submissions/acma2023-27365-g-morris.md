What is a truth? A truth is an opinion considered to be undeniable based on overwhelming
evidence or facts at a given point-in-time. However, some truths are only proven true in
time as we continue to learn and gather more evidence. Therefore, what is considered as
untrue today may actually be true tomorrow. Everyone in society has their own beliefs,
values and experiences, so different thresholds of evidence are required on any given
topic before an individual considers something as fact. This societal indifference is not a
problem that needs a misinformation and disinformation bill to police. It's actually a
strength.

Having the freedom to discuss alternate and descending views encourages critical thinking
and helps our own rationalisation of facts. As such, one official body is unlikely to ever be
completely aligned with all individuals in our society. The ability to make, and act, on our
own decisions is what makes us human and is often considered as a transition to
adulthood.

Disinformation and misinformation is the dissemination of alternate truths that for
someone, enough evidence has not yet been presented to sway them from their current
understanding of the truth. Who is to blame when we have a difference of opinion? The
answer is no one. Therefore, we should not aim to restrict either side of any conversation.

The introduction of this bill intends to stifle and penalize discussion on alternate views of
truth for topics that impact personal safety, humanity or the environment. The irony is that
these are the most important conversations that require the freedom to speak openly
without prejudice or fear of legal retribution. How else can we accumulate enough
evidence to change or solidify our understanding of facts?

This bill should be re-written to reinforce and bolster the protection of our right to express
our personal opinions as limiting this restricts our personal evolution and the overall
enlightenment of humanity, or is that the intent of this bill after all? Removing the ability for
someone to express their views is authoritarian and un-Australian.

Corralling humanity into a single version of truth treats people as nothing more than sheep,
incapable of thinking for themselves. This is akin to slowing a herd down to it's slowest
member or, consequently, to the least intelligent person within the community.

I humbly request that you reject this bill as the alternative is a world that I don't look
forward to.
