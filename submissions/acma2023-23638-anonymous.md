To Whom it May Concern,

As an Australian Citizen and Resident from birth, I am horrified at what the outcome of this Bill could
and would entail.

Having been raised with an understanding that Aussie’s are fiercely independent and outspoken
about their beliefs and that freedom and freedom of expression/speech was a fiercely held and
protected right, it horrifies me to think that our government will be the “sole arbiter of truth”.

This is totally against our ethics of “fairness” and “equality for all” when debate of all kinds will be
stifled and voices that “go against the grain” can be silenced.

How are we supposed to progress as a country and as individuals if we are denied the right to share
OPINIONS, VIEWS and KNOWLEDGE?

Please do not let our country REGRESS into an Orwellian propagandised shell of what once was a
vibrant and exciting country full of animated debate and free exchange of ideas.

This Bill, if passed, will have dire consequences for EVERY citizen.
