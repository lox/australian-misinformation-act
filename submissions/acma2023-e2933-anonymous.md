Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

This proposed bill is in breach of Australia's international human rights obligations under UDHR articles 18 and 19 and
is against our democratic values.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental and non negotiable human right of every Australian and our government should
be protecting this right not threatening to violate it like the proposed bill would do.
We need a balance of opinions and thoughts and this bill would cause a bias and prevent truth telling.

The government is attempting to place upon itself an impossible burden of objectivity. No government body has the
wisdom or ability to sort out what is true and what isn’t. We’ve never had so much information available at our
fingertips in all of human history. The amount of information that can be accessed online is incredibly vast. What
group of bureaucrats could possibly discern truth from falsehood.

I believe this bill is dangerous and must be rejected.
