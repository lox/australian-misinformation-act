Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage over the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I
strongly believe that this bill undermines the freedom of speech that is fundamental to our
democracy.

This bill sets out to create two classes of citizens, with certain individuals such as politicians,
journalists, and members of educational institutions granted the power to spread information
online, regardless of its accuracy. Meanwhile, regular citizens, who often possess valuable
knowledge and expertise, are placed in the second category, risking the suppression of their voices.

This bill puts the power of the internet in the hands of a select group, disproportionately affecting
regular people.

Furthermore, the excessive fines prescribed in the bill will coerce digital services into becoming more
restrictive with regards to speech, surpassing even the most stringent restrictions currently in place.

This will be detrimental to open dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. Additionally, the bill's
applicability across the entire industry without any room for flexibility only compounds the harm it
will cause.

One major flaw in this bill is the impossible task of accurately determining what is true or untrue.

Science and knowledge are always evolving, and what was once considered factual can later be
proved false. For example, we were told by the government and its departments many things about
COVID-19 and the vaccines that later proved to be untrue. ("It was a deadly pandemic", in fact
proved to be approximately as deadly as the seasonal flu, "That the vaccines prevented
transmission"        - patently untrue, "That it was only being spread by the unvaccinated", also patently
untrue, "Masks prevented the spread" also untrue)

Under this legislation, even true information deemed misleading or deceptive could be subject to
removal. This has already happened        - Facebook groups of vaccine injured people were removed with
no notice or opportunity to protest. Freedom of speech enables open and honest discussions to take
place, allowing for the exploration of ideas and fostering the search for truth.

It is concerning that even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia,

has expressed serious reservations about the scope and application of this bill. His critique highlights
the inherent risks of implementing such sweeping legislation that claims to combat misinformation.

Moreover, this bill, intended to protect minorities, may inadvertently result in their persecution.
Often, minorities need to challenge existing beliefs and consensus to achieve progress. By mandating

a single code to be applied to every digital platform, this bill denies minorities a safe space for
discourse, hindering progress.

Furthermore, the proposed delegation of legislative power to private entities and the ACMA violates


-----

the principles upon which our democracy is built. Parliament should be responsible for lawmaking,
not private entities or agencies. This arrangement undermines the balance of power and represents

an unconstitutional abdication of legislative authority.

The power granted to the ACMA to enforce Misinformation Codes and enact standards and rules
infringes upon the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. The definition of
"harm" in the bill encompasses highly contested public policy matters, stifling legitimate discussion
and limiting the freedom of political communication.

This bill asserts the Government's and accredited institutions' authority in determining the truth, the
government itself is exempt from scrutiny, it can publish as much dis/misinformation as it likes while
disregarding the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians. This smacks of totalitarianism,
not what should be happening in a democracy. By de-platforming certain views as misinformation or
disinformation, diversity in viewpoints is curtailed, impeding the essential process of a democratic
country, freedom of speech.

Not only does this bill disempower ordinary citizens by suppressing their viewpoints, but it also
threatens digital platform providers and individuals who dare to express dissenting opinions. The
threats of reputational damage, financial penalties, and interference with personal lives are
reminiscent of oppressive regimes and antithetical to Australian values.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 is deeply concerning and poses a threat to our fundamental rights and
freedoms. It divides citizens into classes, restricts speech, and stifles democratic discourse. I urge the
Department to reconsider this bill and take into account the legitimate concerns raised by experts
and ordinary Australians alike.

Thank you for considering my feedback.

Sincerely,
