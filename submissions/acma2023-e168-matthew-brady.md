I am horrified at this attack on free speech and the attempt to make the government and its approved outlets the single source of
truth.

This is not acceptable and to think my tax dollars will be used to silence my opinions or the ability to find wide ranging
information on topics is truly offensive.

Sincerely
A tax paying, voting Australian
