**Submission of Michelle Anderson – draft Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

I do not consent to this proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Under no circumstances should this Govt or any of their affiliated agencies seek additional
power to censor FREE SPEECH, freedom of thought or expression in this, what is meant to
be a FREE and DEMOCRATIC country. This is NOT communist China!


**Scrap this proposed legislation immediately!**


A true Australia is all about:

- freedom of expression

- freedom of speech

- freedom of movement

- freedom to protest unjust rules, laws and Govt activity

**DO NOT allow the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or require**
them to keep certain records about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation.

**DO NOT enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering**
measures to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA
could register and enforce

DO NOT allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of
regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation
and disinformation on digital platforms.

**I ask YOU. Who decides what is “misinformation” and “disinformation” anyway? Please**
_provide information on who these people will be and their credentials and qualifications to_
_make such judgements on content._
