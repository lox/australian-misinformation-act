# From: Julie Hoskin

 To: Information Integrity Subject: Opposition to the Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 Response requested: No Importance: High Sensitivity: Normal

I am writing to lodge a submission for the upcoming presentation to the Australian Parliament of the Exposure Draft of the
Communications Legislation Amendment ( Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation ) Bill 2023.

This Bill as I understand will be voted on sometime in the near future.

I want to lodge my complete opposition to this Bill going to a vote in any way shape or form or from becoming any kind of
legislation or regulation.

The last thing we want is more power given to corrupt politicians and powerbrokers to censor and dictate to us and to decide
what we can say, feel, think or do.

Who gets to decide what's deemed to be 'misinformation' or 'disinformation'? You've shown us over and over that YOU can't
be trusted.

Get out of our lives you freaking maniacs and take the monsters from the U.N, WEF and their cohorts and collaborators with
you, to prison preferably.

We see you now and we want you to pay for the crimes you've committed against humanity. Your time is very short.

I do NOT consent to any part of this proposed bill being legislated or imposed on Australians.

Julie Hoskin
