**SUBMISSION ON THE COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT**

**(COMBATING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION) BILL 2023**

**Introduction**

1. Women’s Forum Australia (WFA) is an independent think tank established in
2005 that undertakes research, education and policy advocacy on issues
facing women and girls. Our primary focus is advocating and promoting good
policies that will deliver strong economic, social and health policy outcomes
for Australian women and girls, with a particular focus on addressing
behaviour and practices that are harmful and abusive to them. We are a
national organisation with supporters across Australia.

2. Women’s Forum Australia welcomes the opportunity to address the
Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,

Communications, and the Arts in relation to the exposure draft of the
_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and_
_Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Bill), which is said to have been introduced to_
combat the harms that can arise from the propagation of misinformation and
disinformation online.

3. We are concerned that the proposed Bill will have unintended consequences
of limiting free speech and freedom of expression, stifling discussion on
important issues facing Australians. Legislation that inhibits these
fundamental democratic rights will result in poorer policy outcomes for all
Australians, particularly women and girls.

**Concerns regarding the Bill**

4. The Bill gives powers to the Australian Media and Communications Authority
(ACMA) to impose heavy penalties on social media companies (and other
digital platform providers) who fail to crack down on misinformation on their
platforms. This will inevitably lead to heavy-handed censorship on social
media – even more so than we already have – by companies afraid of incurring
millions of dollars in fines.

5. Companies without the means to contest decisions by ACMA will be
powerless to defend their publication and will be forced to remove or restrict
information even if it is factual. Alternatively, they will also be able to use the
legislation as a shield to shut down content they disagree with.


-----

6. Free speech and freedom of expression are cornerstones of all Western liberal
democracies. By its very design, this Bill gives ACMA, a government agency,
the power to determine and regulate ‘misinformation and disinformation’.
Essentially, this is an arm of the Federal Government giving itself the power
to decide what is true and what is not, and whether or not that information can
be made available to the public in Australia.

7. The definitions of harm, serious harm, misinformation, and disinformation are
broad and vague in the drafting of the Bill. Misinformation is described as
‘online content that is false, misleading or deceptive, that is shared or created
_without an intent to deceive but can cause and contribute to serious harm’._
**Disinformation is** defined as ‘misinformation _that_ _is_ _intentionally_

_disseminated with the intent to deceive or cause serious harm.’ The legislation_
does not define ‘serious harm’, but there’s a broad category of issues that it
relates to, including inciting hate towards citizens based on ethnicity,
nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental
disability.

8. The issue with broadly worded legislation is that it can be liberally applied to
ensure that there is no dissent to accepted ideological narratives when it
comes to social, health, and economic policies, giving ACMA the power to
suppress genuine discussion and robust debate across healthcare, human
rights, education, the environment, and our legal system where debate and
discussion are critical for producing better policy outcomes.

9. This will particularly disadvantage women fighting to have their voices heard
and rights protected in a time where many legislators, academics and parts of
the media are disregarding them in favour of gender identity and gender
expression. Would ACMA ban social media platforms from airing the voices
of lesbian women who reject self-identification as the opposite sex as harmful?
Given that the Human Rights Commission in Tasmania ruled that lesbians
could not hold female-only events, describing the rejection of biological males
who identify as lesbian ‘transwomen’ as discrimination,[1] we fear this is
possible with the Bill providing the mandate for it.

10. ‘Hate’ is a subjective term often weaponised by activists, politicians, and

journalists to shut down debate across various issues. Women’s Forum
Australia has had posts removed and censored on social media platforms
under the guise of combatting ‘hate speech’. For example, last year, we were
censored on Facebook for making a post including the factual statement that
men cannot give birth.[2] The post was deemed by Facebook to be hate speech,
was removed, and our page was subject to 30 days of reduced visibility with
the threat of being removed from the platform entirely. Facebook reversed the

ban after media reported on the unjust censorship restrictions,[3] but not before
our visibility and post engagement decreased dramatically, significantly
hampering the reach of our advocacy for women and girls on a wide range of
critical issues.

11. This Bill further empowers both social media companies to censor content

they disagree with, and activists within Government and the media to use the
law against social media platforms and organisations online that permit
opposing views to be debated and discussed on contentious issues. The effect
of all this is to ultimately suppress the voices of individuals who engage on
those platforms.

12. Since the passing of the Online Safety Act 2021, there has been an increase

in the forced removal of content under Australian law by the e-Safety
Commissioner in what appears to be extraordinary abuse of their powers to
combat crime and abuse online. The office of the e-Safety Commissioner sits
under the umbrella of ACMA.

13. An example of this is from May 2023, where the e-Safety Commission used

its powers to force the removal of tweets from long-term Australian
Breastfeeding Association counsellor Jasmine Sussex, which expressed
concern about biological men attempting to induce lactation to ‘breastfeed’
babies. Twitter advised Ms Sussex that they had been informed by an
Australian Government entity that her tweets had violated Australian Law and
would no longer be available in the country.[4]

14. Biological males attempting to feed infants is a new phenomenon. It cannot

be done without the support of drugs that stimulate lactation, and there has
been minimal scientific investigation into its impact on the baby, particularly
when a trans-identified male is attempting to feed while also on cross-sex
hormones. It is an important topic that requires discussion, research, and
debate, yet the e-Safety Commissioner determined discussion of it to be
harmful information to be banned.

15. This Bill creates two classes of citizens. Government, Government accredited

educational institutions and approved media outlets are exempt from the Bill.
This means politicians, journalists and academics have the right to publish and
share information regardless of whether it is factually correct. At the same
time, private citizens and independent organisations can be censored for
challenging the narrative. This creates a power imbalance and puts ordinary
people at a significant disadvantage.

16. The role of the media and the public is to scrutinise Government. The public

is also entitled to call out media bias and examine academia. The Bill has the
power to shut down this vital part of our democracy. Would opposition to a
government policy be deemed ‘misinformation’ or ‘harmful to democracy’ and
banned by the Government through ACMA? Would independent institutions
be restricted from calling out flaws in a study from a government institution? It
is deeply problematic that the Bill gives ACMA the power to enforce this type
of censorship.

17. Earlier this year, Queensland passed 'self-ID laws’, which allow individuals to

change their legally recognised sex and be protected as their newly identified
sex under discrimination laws. This means that men who self-identify as
women under the new laws can now access female-only spaces and services,
including bathrooms, changing rooms, prisons, and domestic violence
shelters. During the lead-up to the vote on the Births, Deaths and Marriages
_Registration Bill 2022, women's rights activists and organisations submitted_
volumes of evidence demonstrating the risk this legislation posed to the rights
and safety of women. During her speech, Minister for Women Shannon
Fentiman declared, "There is no evidence, from any jurisdiction, to suggest
that women will have fewer rights or be less safe as a result of these
changes."[5]

18. This statement is blatantly false. In our submission to the Legal Affairs and

Safety Committee[6] and in our supplementary evidence,[7] we provided welldocumented evidence that women were being harmed due to selfidentification laws and policies, both in Australia and overseas. If the
Government determines that our position is ‘harmful or misinformation’, should
it have the power to censor our work from being available online? Absolutely
not, and this is why the Bill is dangerous.

**Conclusion**

19. Neither politicians, government agencies, nor approved media outlets should

have the power to determine what is true or accurate. New information and
research are constantly emerging, challenging established facts. The power
to challenge the established positions has led to women being given the right
to vote and stand for parliament, it has resulted in ground-breaking medical
research and changes to societal attitudes particularly when it comes to social
justice causes.

20. While there is unfortunately a lot of false information online, there is sadly at

times also false information shared by both our governments and media. With
this Bill, ‘truth’ and ‘fact’ will be determined by the ideology of the Government
of the day.

21. The best way for Government to counter misinformation online is to be a

trustworthy and reliable source of information and to encourage free and open
discussion and debate. If the Government needs to censor its way into
managing ‘truth’, it will further erode the trust of the Australian people, despite
this being one of the very things the Bill seeks to promote.

22. This Bill seriously undermines our democracy, and Women’s Forum Australia

strongly urges the Government to abandon it altogether.
