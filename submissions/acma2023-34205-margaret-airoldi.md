# This proposed Bill is unjust.

 The onerous demands of the rules placed on digital platform providers and the penalties for breaches of those demands would cause those providers to avoid any content which could be interpreted by ACMA as “misinformation” or “disinformation”. 

 All those with whom I have discussed this proposed Bill disagree with the statement “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy”, which is the first of the key points on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 – Fact sheet.

 This proposed Bill attacks the principles of democracy.

 The proposed unwarranted curtailing, and/or removal of content on digital platform providers, assessed as “misinformation” causing “harm”, or “disinformation” causing “serious harm”, by an unelected body of people, ACMA, is unacceptable.

 The vast majority of Australians have the capacity to decide for themselves what is for their own common good, and do not need ACMA, or any other body for that matter, to be assigned the extreme degree of power which this Bill proposes.

 This proposed Bill would deprive ordinary Australian citizens of their right, under the International Agreements to which Australia is a signatory, to be informed of rigorous and healthy debate on controversial issues which affect our humanity.

 This Bill proposes that content authorised by our Government is to be excluded from this scrutiny. This is an unjustifiable decision, as a Government which cannot be held accountable for the statements they make, to the very people who elected them, fails the very essence of a Government which aspires to represent all the people. (The truth will set you free).

 I recommend that this Bill be withdrawn.
