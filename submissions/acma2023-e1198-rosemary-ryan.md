Please consider the following:
After reading the Bill I consider it is a significant overreach by the government. No government now or in the future should
wield this much say on its citizens, as has been seen the effects on many other countries whose government started for the people
and ended in dictatorship.

Under the UN Declaration of Humam Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political rights of which Australian
Government sign on to this proposed bill is not not in keeping and is inconsistent with that which we are covenanted to. Therefore
we would be breaking our own word in world rights. What a shame face on Australia before the world.

The Bill gives power to unelected bureaucrats with no accountability in public place and no transparency of what they have
chosen as their truth.

The Bill gives digital providers the opportunity to decide policing of speech and shut down who they choose with no
accountability.

The Bill can be used to weaponise and shut down those who call for free discussions to the betterment of society.

The Bill is being proposed on an idealogical "harm" definition.

We have seen other countries fall into this trap once a Bill is past, eg Hitler did that with groups in Europe and his ideologues
were not sound, however, he censored those who spoke for human rights. It gave ruinous reign over that nation once rulings
were put through parliament to use their regime's truth with no accountability.

I am shocked to read that government authorised content will not be shut down, scrutinised nor accountable. This is no different
than North Korea and Chinese regimes. That is out of balance completelyfor Australia to have one rule for government and
another rule for the people it is supposed to serve.

The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to intervene in a breech of privacy to users of private and digital platforms by requiring
information from them and evidence which is their own property.

There is insufficient accountability by any standard of misuse and abuse of censorship.

The few provision that are in the Bill are far from that to meet International law for the interference of fundamental rights of
freedom of speech and expression.

The severity of penalties for failing to comply are beyond belief and will cause a high level of loss of freedom of speech by fear of
penalties.

I request that this Bill be dissolved and if needed, a new bill be considered in line with the rights of the citizens of Australia to
express their opinions and values without censorship, so that healthy discussion can be held. As has been in years prior, on
slavery, children in workforce under age, working hours, work practices and safety etc etc.
