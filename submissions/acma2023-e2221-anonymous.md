As someone who loves our nation and appreciates our freedom, I am very concerned about the government’s proposed
“misinformation” law and the potential erosion of free speech in this country.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

Even when I disagree with information being presented, I acknowledge that the person presenting it has the right to do so. I value
the opportunity to carry out my own research, debate with others, and come to my own conclusions without being told what I
can or cannot think. The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media.
It is a violation of Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

The possibilities for control and the abuse of power that come with this proposed amendment are alarming. It is not the role of
the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think, and this entire bill smacks of authoritarianism.

Please reject this bill.
