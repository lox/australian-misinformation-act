# Government control of public discourse is not possible in a democracy. Mis/disinformation is an opinion. As has been evident throughout history and in our current times,what is not seen as being true,has come to be found in time to be indeed true.The only position a democratic government can take in preventing individual or group expression, is if the communication is urging violence or war, or abuse of children.
