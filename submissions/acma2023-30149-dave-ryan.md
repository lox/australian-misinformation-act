**Re:** New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)_

Dear Officer,

_“All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is_
_accepted as being self-evident.”_
This quote is often credited to the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Ironically, there is no evidence
to prove he said or wrote this statement, and the attribution to him is likely to be false – or
“misinformation”. Regardless, the sentiment behind it is valid: at first, some theories may be
contrary to commonly held beliefs and the science of the day, but over time they are backed by
evidence and accepted as the norm.

The following is a list of just a few people who could be censored under the proposed
_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023_
(the Bill):


Aristarchus, Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo
Ignaz Semmelweis
Clair Cameron Patterson
John Snow
Louis Pasteur
Charles Darwin
Voltaire


Ghandi
Emmeline Pankhurst
Martin Luther King
William Wilberforce
Dietrich Bonhoeffer
Nelson Mandela
Peter Lalor


Today the term ‘flat-earther’ is used to describe someone who stubbornly adheres to an outmoded
idea. Yet, if the Bill was in place when Pythagoras and Aristotle first suggested the earth was round,
their “misinformation” would most definitely have been censored as to avoid the apparent harm to
anyone who might go sailing and fall off the edge of the earth.

Once upon a time it was advertised that “more doctors smoke Camel than any other cigarette”, and
smoking was “refreshing” for your lungs. Science changes, and this can only be encouraged through
questioning and debate. Censorship will stifle that debate.

Where would the LGBTQI+ community be if their voices had continued to be censored? Would
Australia’s Indigenous population have a vote, let alone a Voice if there had been censorship on
commentary to their plight in the mid-1900’s?

What constitutes “serious harm”? Could it have been considered “serious harm”, at the time, to
abolish slavery, to allow women a vote, to recognise Aborigines as people? Could the impact on the
tobacco industry have been considered “serious harm” to the economy, and therefore objection
cigarettes been silenced?

Included in the definition of serious harm is “harm that … undermines the integrity of an Australian
democratic process”. Yet the censorship of its citizens does exactly that. I believe it is fair to say that,
if he was alive today, Peter Lalor would be against such a piece of legislation.

The Bill has potential for significant misuse. The Department needs to consider if they would be
happy for such legislation to be in the hands of other political parties – past, present or future. There
are some from around the world for whom this would definitely not be the case.

Similarly, putting the decision as to what is misinformation and what is truth in the hands of few
brings the spectre of corruption. Again, this may not be the case for the initial incumbents, but will it
always be so? It is important to consider the potential for this to occur.

The Bill introduces a “do as I say, not as I do” philosophy. While the general public will be censored
for comments, government, professional news content providers, and educational institutions are
exempt. How can it be that a person’s comment is considered legitimate based on their employer or
the position they hold? Is a doctor or a judge or any other member of society not as worthy to
express their opinion? Can a politician, a journalist or an academic not create the same level of harm
by making a false statement? On the contrary, it could be argued that they can create more harm
due to the nature of the position they hold and through the wide reach of their audience.

As an example of the above three points, when the Morrison government wanted to repeal the
Medevac law relating to refugees, Professor Jane McAdam, author of Refugee Rights and Policy
_Wrongs: A frank, up-to-date guide by experts said misinformation peddled by political leaders and_
certain segments of the media was feeding public disquiet and insecurity about refugees and people
seeking asylum. Launching the book Dr Kerryn Phelps AM warned that misinformation was now
political currency, claiming that the excuses from the Morrison government “…amount to a concerted
_campaign of misinformation … sadly and shamefully aided and abetted by elements of the_
_mainstream media who have published these claims.”_

It is my opinion that the Bill is the equivalent of book burning. There is a long history of attempts to
silence lines of thinking that disagree with those in power. Australia has historically fought to defend
the right to free speech. It will be a very sad day if this country switches to be the persecutor and
not the protector. As such, I ask that the Bill be dismissed.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide my opinion – it is an opportunity I feel a duty to take while I
can and before the introduction of the Bill no longer allows it.

Kind regards,
David Ryan
