Submission re Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

I object to the proposed legislation.

Instead of creating conditions that infantilise the citizenry, thwart the free exchange of ideas and
free expression, promote mistrust of government and institutions and drive hate and extremism
underground,let’s think about what would help create a thriving, mature, open, transparent public
square which is necessary for society to evolve and grow and solve an increasingly complex array
of problems.

Be visionary. Don’t allow this legislation to go through and further regress our society.

Thankyou
