To Whom it may concern

I think that the proposed legislation is extremely dangerous and a real threat to democracy. The first line reads: "Misinformation
and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”
The big question is “who determines what is misinformation and disinformation?” Who is going to decide what is true? Who
determines what is likely to cause “serious harm”? Certainly, the government does not have a good track record in regard to
harm and truth.

Threat to safety and wellbeing
The past few years have shown that the various government bodies and main stream media can not be trusted to tell the truth.
We were repeatedly told that the COVID vaccines were “safe and effective.” Data from around the world now clearly shows
that was not true. They are not safe. The number of adverse effects in VAERS, DAEN, the Yellow Card system etc. rocketed
after the rollout began. VAERS had more adverse effects from the COVID vaccines reported in the first four months post
rollout, than all other vaccines together over the previous 30 years.

Excess mortality statistics clearly showed a dramatic rise after the rollout began. So many people are suddenly dropping dead
that a new malady (SADS) has been invented to explain it. Once rare, myocarditis and pericarditis are now common among
people who took the COVID vaccine, especially young people. The COVID vaccines are clearly not safe, yet highly
credentialed experts in cardiology, immunology, virology etc. who raised concerns about potential dangers, were accused of
misinformation and disinformation, censored, discredited and cancelled.

In August 2021, the ABC released a COVID vaccine campaign video called ‘Vax Facts!’ Dr Swan told Australians that when it
came to COVID vaccines,“We know what their side effects are already. There are no surprises around the corner.” That was a
lie. Almost two years on and there is still much that we don’t know about how the COVID vaccines affect people. Research is
still being done, and new and grave potential side effects are being discovered all the time.

The COVID vaccines are not effective either. They do not stop infection or transmission. Data from the NHS in the UK clearly
shows that the more doses people received, the more likely they were to be hospitalised and die. So far, 93% of recorded
deaths from COVID in the UK were people who were triple jabbed. Despite this, in Australia, we are still being advised in TV
campaigns to get another booster shot.

The TGA banned Ivermectin. There was a media campaign referring to it as “horse paste.” However, there are now at least 90
peer reviewed studies which confirm that Ivermectin was extremely effective in dealing with COVID. The statistics from India
alone were outstanding.

It’s impossible to determine how many people were harmed due to medical misinformation and disinformation promulgated by
official government and news sources throughout the pandemic. It is noteworthy that people disagreeing with the government
narrative would be subject to ACMA’s proposed legislation; however, content posted by the government (and the government’s
approved media and educational institutions) is excluded. Accordingly, mis- and disinformation disseminated by official sources
will not be subject to the laws intended to stamp out mis- and disinformation online.

Threat to democracy.
A healthy democracy requires freedom of speech and full disclosure of facts relating to a matter. Ideas and views from the whole
ideological and political spectrum should be discussed, without resorting to name-calling, references to “harm” and “hate speech”
and words like misinformation and disinformation to close down debate.

influence from stakeholders, such as was rife when the tobacco industry funded research to show that smoking is good for you.
In a healthy democracy, debate is encouraged with the hope that good arguments, based on truth, will win. Transparent debate is
always preferable to censorship.

Threat to society
Official government and news sources informed the public that we needed to be locked down and wear masks. Experts who
stated that lockdowns and mask-wearing do more harm than good were accused of misinformation, but there are now multiple
reports confirming that they were correct.

We will probably never know the full extent of the harm caused to our society by government misinformation during the
pandemic. However, we do know that many businesses and relationships were destroyed and many suicides occurred. Only time
will tell how many children were adversely affected in their education and to what extent.

Harm includes “Hatred against a group in Australian society.” There is already evidence that speaking against such topics as
gender reassignment surgery, men playing in women’s sports or men accessing female facilities such as toilets or changing rooms,
is considered hateful. If this legislation is passed, any debate concerning topics such as the high rates of trans gender regret or
defending traditional marriage or possible negative results of voting “no” in the upcoming referendum on “The Voice” could be
stifled by labelling information as mis- or disinformation.

Threat to the economy
Under the category “Harm to the Australian environment,” will content complaining about ripping out natural habitat to build solar
or wind farms be considered mis- or disinformation? What about suggestions that solar or wind energy is unreliable and pushes
power prices up, or that windmills kill birds? Or that solar panels and windmills cause a disposal problem when they no longer
work? Will expressing concern that the Net Zero agenda will give economic advantage to our competitors and damage our
economy be considered mis- or disinformation under the pretext of protecting us from climate change?

After the past few years, confidence in government and the main stream media is at an all-time low. People are realising that they
have not been given all the facts about many issues. Power prices are rising despite promises. People are getting COVID after 3,
4 or more jabs. Most people know someone who died or suffered adverse effects after a COVID shot.

People are searching for facts online from social media and alternate news sources. ACMA’s proposed legislation appears to be
a mechanism to control information and, as a result, the Australian people. I think that the proposed legislation should be
scrapped, or Australia will cease to be a democracy and become a totalitarian dictatorship.

I am happy for this submission to be made public, but I prefer to remain anonymous.
