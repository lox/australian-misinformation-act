# Objec�on to censorship of informa�on by classing it as misinforma�on.

Summary

The introduc�on of any piece of legisla�on that in any way tries to restrict the freedom of ideas,
thoughts, in any format, ins�tutes a totalitarian form of control over every area of life to human
beings. We currently have laws that deal with certain areas of thought and ac�ons that are deemed
as illegal and against the moral judgement of the people. But to have a department that is
specifically designed to silence what it may perceive as misinforma�on and that department is not
controlled by a majority public view is only trouble. That will be because it will be controlled by a few
people pushing their own agenda (as proven in the last 3 years).

It is not possible to list all the reason that this bill should not be enacted, and the pure fact that it
even exists raises serious concerns over the leadership of the people who proposed it. Now do they
have the right to propose it? The answer has to be yes. Do the majority of people have the right to
say no and choose not to consent? The answer to this is also yes. Are the people who proposed this
bill doing the right thing for their cons�tuents, that they work for, is definitely in conten�on.
Ironically this very bill is designed to stop people from raising that concern as it could be classed as
disinforma�on.

History as so many examples of thoughts and ideas that were considered radical and crazy that over
�me proved to be a generally accepted truth. Things like the earth is round, Gravity, medical
advancement and so on. With out the ability propose an idea you are restric�ng the ability of Free
thought.

I ask this ques�on, who gives you the power to tell the Australian people what is right or wrong
about informa�on that my be dispersed? The answer is the very people that you are trying to censor
by threats of fines and punishment. If you can’t, see the disastrous circular reference here then you
are not service the very Australian that put you in that posi�on.

# What is the right to freedom of opinion and expression?

## The right to freedom of opinion is the right to hold opinions without interference, and cannot be subject to any exception or restriction.

 The right to freedom of expression extends to any medium, including written and oral communications, the media, public protest, broadcasting, artistic works and commercial advertising. The right is not absolute. It carries with it special responsibilities, and may be restricted on several grounds. For example, restrictions could relate to filtering access to certain internet sites, the urging of violence or the classification of artistic material.

# Mul�ple Court Cases Rela�ng to this ma�er.

_Wills._

In the 2019 cases of Clubb v Edwards and Preston v Avery

In Lange v Australian Broadcas�ng Corpora�on

I could spend mul�ple days finding heaps of reference of history and legisla�on. But to what avail if
you cant see this as morally wrong then you should not be in the posi�on you are in.

Summary

Generally it should be understood that this legisla�on is a bad idea at bests and a totalitarian
concept at worst and I personally as a free person do not consent to this piece of legisla�on even if it
is enacted.
