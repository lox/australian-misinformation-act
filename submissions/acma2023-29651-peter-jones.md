Canberra ACT 2600

**Re: Proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Misinforma�on and**
**Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.**

I strongly oppose this proposed Bill. The proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment
(Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023 is vague in its defini�ons and intent and
accordingly consider that it poses a threat to our democracy, society, and economy.

The ACMA Fact sheet is misleading. While sta�ng that “Misinforma�on and disinforma�on
pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society
and economy” it fails to state how exis�ng Legisla�on is inadequate. Legisla�on and
Regula�ons dealing with the Harm described by the Bill includes Telecommunica�ons Act
(without this amendment), Online Safety Act, Criminal Code and Crimes Acts, Australian
Consumer Law, Australian Security & Investments Commission Act, Foreign Interference
(Countermeasures) Act and environmental, an�-discrimina�on and an�-terrorism
legisla�on. This list does not purport to be exhaus�ve; I am not a lawyer.

This then begs the ques�on as to why is this Bill necessary? Misinforma�on and
disinforma�on are defined in part as “the content contains informa�on that is false,
misleading or decep�ve; and the content is not excluded content for misinforma�on
purposes;” It is noted that Government authorised misinforma�on and disinforma�on is
excluded content.

A clue to the expanded powers sought can be found in the document “A report to
government on the adequacy of digital pla�orms’ disinforma�on and news quality
measures” (ACMA June 2021).

“Over the previous 18 months, we have seen increasing concern within the community over
the ‘infodemic’ of online disinforma�on and misinforma�on, par�cularly in rela�on to the
real-world impacts of COVID-19. The propaga�on of these falsehoods and conspiracies
undermines public health efforts, causes harm to individuals, businesses, and democra�c
ins�tu�ons, and in some cases, incites individuals to carry out acts of violence.”

“Belief in COVID-19 falsehoods or unproven claims appears to be related to high exposure to
online informa�on and lack of trust in news outlets or authorita�ve sources”

This is an unfounded opinion. Misinforma�on? A report by the Museum of Australian
Democracy in 2018, preCOVID-19, states that “levels of trust in government and poli�cians
in Australia are at their lowest levels since �me series data has been available.” Could a
further decline in trust in Government and news outlets be due to lack of transparency
around the factors driving decisions or failure of news outlets to properly inves�gate media
releases? Or innate Australian scep�cism of poli�cians?

Recalling 2021, the Government was running a scare campaign but with no defini�ve data or
evidence jus�fying its posi�on. This was a novel virus; the vaccines had “emergency
approval”. It was guessing. Anyone ques�oning its narra�ve or voicing scep�cism was
accused of spreading misinforma�on and disinforma�on and called derogatory names. In
fact, the word “scep�c” came to be used as a derogatory term. AHPRA was threatening and
deregistering medical professionals for asking ques�ons. The media ran in lock step telling us
to believe “The Science”. It appears ACMA considered any informa�on contrary to the
Government narra�ve were “falsehoods”.

Two years later, the narra�ve has changed; the vaccines do not prevent transmission (Dr
Nick Coatsworth: this was an assump�on), do not prevent one ge�ng COVID-19 but reduce
hospitalisa�ons. We also now know the risk of serious but rare adverse events from the
vaccines – unknown to the public at the �me of vaccine mandates. The Senate Select
Commi�ee on COVID-19 report has cri�cised the lack of transparency around the factors
driving decisions. Government has not acknowledged nor apologised for the harm to the
economy and social cohesion caused by its secrecy, adver�sing campaigns and lack of trust
in the community to form opinion based on facts.

In June 2021, the Federal Court ruled ROBODEBT unlawful. It took a Royal Commission to
reveal how good governance was compromised.

We have also learnt that the Australian Pes�cides and Veterinary Medicines Authority
(APVMA) was "captured" by industry interests and subject to regular complaints of
misconduct. It called its cri�cs conspiracists spreading misinforma�on and disinforma�on
harmful to the economy - repea�ng agricultural chemical industry lobby misinforma�on.

One expects that informa�on is based on sound data, facts, or at least some form of
evidence. Otherwise, it is just an opinion. Everybody has at least one. Scien�fic knowledge,
however, is not based on belief or opinions. There is no such thing as “The Science”. A
hypothesis is tested by rigorous observa�on and analysis of data. It is subject to scep�cal
review and challenge before it can enter the realm of scien�fic informa�on. We rely on
scien�fic method to debunk the hypotheses of Eugenics. Science underpins all engineering.
Unpublished works purpor�ng to be science but not submi�ed for peer scru�ny and review
are s�ll just hypotheses – opinions. Modelling the effec�veness of a vaccine to reduce
transmission in the absence of any data, based on invalid assump�ons is not science. In
adver�sing, it is disinforma�on -intended to deceive. It is alarming when poli�cs steps in to
make a mockery of science.

When dealing with uncertainty and a dearth of data to frame Public Policy, one would expect
a thorough, open and transparent assessment of risks to public health, wealth and
happiness (considering the “effect of uncertainty on objec�ves” :ISO 31000) and proposed
risk mi�ga�on strategies across the whole of government. The Government failed to
recognise the risk of locking people in aged care facili�es, apartments and hotels with
inadequate infec�on management and recirculated unfiltered air. This resulted in a
“dispropor�onate number of deaths”. In my professional field of engineering, failure to
conduct a comprehensive risk analysis has been deemed to be a breach of duty of care Negligence.

ACMA claims “The Bill includes strong protec�ons for privacy and freedom of speech”. “The
Bill is directed at encouraging digital pla�orm providers to have robust systems and
measures in place to address misinforma�on and disinforma�on on their services, rather
than the ACMA directly regula�ng individual pieces of content”. Do I trust the technology
pla�orms to judge what is misinforma�on and disinforma�on when they profit from
dissemina�ng opinions on anything and everything but have penal�es for misreading the
Government narra�ve of what cons�tutes harm? What a dilemma. Who decides what is “(d)
harm to the health of Australians”? The pharmaceu�cal industry lobby paying for adver�sing
on the digital pla�orms? Who decides what is “(e) harm to the Australian environment”?
The chemical industry lobby also paying up? Who decides what is “(f) economic or financial
harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy”? The
Defence Industry lobby? The Coal lobby? The climate-change lobby? Or all the above?

I have no problem with digital pla�orm providers having robust systems and measures in
place to detect content that breaches or incites a breach of Australian laws. The term
“misinforma�on” is subjec�ve and open to abuse by Government, lobbyists, and special
interest groups. Informa�on is based on facts and evidence and open to scep�cal scru�ny;
otherwise, it is a belief or opinion. Some parts of Government (Federal, State and Local
Government) appear quite capable of arbitrary and selec�ve use of “facts” - and ge�ng
them wrong - influenced by lobbyists and special interest groups. Why does a ci�zen have to
rely on Freedom of Informa�on requests and Royal Commissions to penetrate the veil of
secrecy behind Government decision making?

A defini�on of Harm that would be capable of being tested by the Judicial process would be
content that breaches Australian laws. Why does ACMA seek powers to limit content beyond
this? I would have thought that exis�ng legisla�on provides the necessary defini�ons,
framework and safeguards to deal with the Harm envisaged by this proposed Bill.
Administra�on of the Criminal, consumer, pruden�al, environment, an�-discrimina�on, and
an�-terrorism legisla�on is obviously not within ACMA’s remit. Perhaps it needs to develop
“robust systems and measures” to liaise with those parts of Government that do have
responsibility for those Acts.

We do not know if this proposed Bill is a child of the Parliament or the bureaucracy.
However, ACMA might want to review its objec�ves. Is it intended to protect an assumed
undiscerning general public incapable of reasonable thought? Is the inten�on to restrict
debate – to further lower the veil of secrecy over Government narra�ves? Is the inten�on to
censor opinions the Government does not like? It should consider the A�orney-General’s
Department Public Sector guidance on Right to freedom of opinion and expression.
(https://www.ag.gov.au/.../right-freedom-opinion-and-expression). ACMA might also
consider the Royal Commission into the ROBODEBT debacle, lessons learned and its duty of
care to provide “frank and full advice”.
