# Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

**What is, and what isn’t misinformation and disinformation and who decides?**

The ACMA’s current setup has contributed to the implementation of media restrictions that have been
preventing freedom of expression by professional health and medical people many of whom have
genuine provable concerns about the damage being done to the public by the Covid vaccines.

Since Covid, and the demands by ATAGI (Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation), that
everyone must receive the covid vaccines or suffer consequences that included loss of job, loss of access
to public and medical facilities, loss of access to stores that were not supplying essential needs etc.

The real travesty and denial of human rights by ATAGI is revealed when consideration is given to the fact
that the Covid vaccines were experimental – never before has the Australian public been forced to be
medicated with experimental drugs that were approved after only months of testing rather than years –
that type of action is the domain of totalitarian rule reminiscent of WW2 and the resultant agreement at
the Geneva Convention in 1949:

‘No prisoner of war may be subject to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments
of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner
concerned and carried out in his interest. Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners
of War, Geneva, 12 August 1949, Article 13.’

**ATAGI ensured freedom of expression was taken away from every medical and health professional.**
Doctors, nurses, health researchers and natural health professionals have not been allowed to speak out
publicly regarding the covid vaccines and some of the disastrous health results – only those medical
people who agree with ATAGI have been given the freedom to speak. Those Doctors who have
attempted to inform the public or who have disagreed with ATAGI and who, in following their
conscience, refused to follow ATAGI’s demands, have been deregistered. To date the ACMA has accepted
and enforced the demands of ATAGI regarding media exposure of any knowledge that disagrees in any
way with ATAGI’s stance. ATAGI, the government decision-maker regarding all issues regarding vaccines
is not made up of Health professionals – rather they are government personnel who, in a totalitarian
move, have effectively gagged those people who, unlike the government personnel, have spent years
training and working in the health industry in order to be qualified to make decisions regarding the
health and wellbeing of the public!

Social media has become the only way those who follow the concepts of the Hippocratic Oath ‘to do no
harm’ have been able to voice their concerns. Since social media platforms have been forced to remove
all material that relates to the dangers of the covid vaccines, many medical professionals have gone to
the expense of setting up websites and supplying knowledge and peer reviewed research along with
figures accumulated by various countries that definitely do not confirm the claims by ATAGI that the
covid vaccines are safe. Such conscientious people have been labelled ‘Conspiracy theorists’ and while
there are real conspiracy theories, the voices of those seeking to provide factual information are
suppressed.

Yes, there is misinformation, but government bodies are not lacking in bias and misinformation
themselves. Before any movement is made towards changing the misinformation and disinformation

laws, there needs to be a Royal Commission that investigates the decisions made by ATAGI especially
regarding the following:

a) What evidence there is to support the claim that those who were not vaccinated, were more

likely to infect others than those who had been vaccinated when those who were vaccinated,
also infected others. It was on the basis of this claim that the following was required:

b) ATAGI demanded that each adult person was required to receive a series of experimental covid

vaccines if they wished to continue to be employed or work in a government or health related
occupation BUT what sort of vaccine does not prevent infection or re-infection in anyone?

c) How valid was the justification by ATAGI that the covid vaccines reduced the intensity of the

symptoms in those who contracted covid. Since covid itself mutates to lesser and lesser intense
infections, and each individual varies in their reactions, how can the vaccine be named as the
cause of lesser symptoms in some people?

d) Why were a number of basic human rights laws illegally ignored by ITAGI when they brought in

their mandates? Is ATAGI above the law?

Government bodies can be dangerous when they take on too much power. Freedom of choice should be
a basic right in a developed and humane society and that includes the right to offer and view differing
points of view especially by professionals in the field in question. A blanket approach to contradictory
and opposing viewpoints is suppression.

A much better system of what is, and what isn’t misinformation needs to be developed before the
powers of ACMA are increased.
