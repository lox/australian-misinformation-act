**Misinformation & Disinformation Bill 2023**

At my age I didn’t think I would ever need to make my voice heard regarding issues
the Government is proposing. But here I am….

The Mis- and Disinformation Bill 2023 on the table is a huge overreach by
Government into the everyday lives of the citizens of Australia. We should be able to
decide for ourselves what is mis- or disinformation and that can only be achieved by
information from various different sources – being the basis of democracy.
By shutting down a huge part of information and only feed the people one side of a
story, is just the beginning of the start of true tyranny.

I have lived alongside a country where the Government’s beliefs were forced upon
the people and their lives were incredibly impacted by those in power. Everything
was controlled, forbidden, criminalised with NO free speech – unless one toed the
Party Line!

We should never be put into a situation like this and I strongly oppose the
implementation of this crazy bill.
