To whom it may concern,

I would like to make a submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I feel that this should not proceed as it will severely
restrict freedom of speech and lead to serious unintended consequences. Regardless of the supposedly
noble grounds for this legislation it is going to be a major restriction on the proper functioning of
society. We have achieved the current level of civilisation because of constant questioning and
adherence to the scientific method and the scientific method relies on questioning your assumptions
and beliefs. Science is never settled.

I have noted that the government is excused from this legislation. There are many examples where
government has been wrong or have deliberately deceived the public. It cannot be assumed that
government is always benign or correct. Electoral communications from digital providers are not
exempt, this may result in electoral communications being restricted. You may find that another political
party attains power and uses this bill against providers that are sympathetic to the opposition. This
could come from all sides of politics. It is also stated that private messages are exempt from the rules
but the last paragraph under clause 3.1.2 contradicts this. This paragraph will lead to monitoring and
censorship of private messages by providers to ensure they don’t contravene the legislation

In reference to clause 3.3.1, using fact-checkers and other third party contractors to monitor
communications is a case of introducing politically biased organisations in to this process. There is a
great deal of evidence to show that so called fact checkers have strong political biases and are
themselves guilty of spreading mis- and disinformation. It also opens the possibility of activists making
vexatious complaints about a provider, even if these complaints are ultimately rejected, the mere
making of them and the considerable time a provider must use to fight them will effectively silence any
alternative views to the activist belief.

Regarding clause 3.3.2, abrogating the right against self incrimination is a dangerous step in the
direction of removing traditional legal protections that have underpinned our society, the consequences
of which are hard to predict. It puts people in a very difficult position, where they can be charged with a
crime whether they speak up or not. It should be up to the judicial system to find and present evidence
in a court of law that a crime has been committed.

The size of the fines are going to be a very effective deterrent on speech that will go way beyond the
scope of this legislation. Digital platform providers can be fined up to $1.375 million, individuals up to
$275,000k, or daily fines of $11,000 to corporations and $8,250 for individuals and 12 months gaol. This
is blatantly excessive and is going to be a very effective brake on all communication due to fear of non
compliance, even into areas not meant to be covered by the code.

Many beliefs in the past have turned out to be incorrect and this is only due to small numbers of people
questioning established “facts”, that turned out to be untrue. Examples are, the earth is flat, blood
letting is a cure for disease, exercise is bad for you, ulcers are caused by worry and treated by antacid.
Anyone who questioned these beliefs would fall under the scope of mis- and disinformation legislation if
it existed at the time. And there have been versions of such legislation in the past, and it is only with the
overturning of restrictions on free speech that many established beliefs have been overturned.
Questioning, challenging, refuting, arguing and debating established beliefs is crucial to getting closer to
a genuine truth. And the best way to refute mis- and disinformation is to allow debate, and to explain


-----

the government beliefs and the facts and logic behind that belief. Just banning speech is going to be the
best way of fostering conspiracy theories and mis- or disinformation, these things are usually
exaggerated in a low information environment. I hope that the current government can see the danger
of this bill and cancel their plan to introduce it.

Lance Smart
