# The preposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the preposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 It seems to me that the bottom line to consider is - do we want to live in a democratic Australia or a dictatorship? To appoint the ACMA to monitor the misinformation or the disinformation of social media and the general public places a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of a single group of people. To believe that any group of people can be totally unbiased in their decision making, as well as being infallible in their judgement a hundred percent of the time is clearly unrealistic and frankly impossible. People should be allowed to have their own opinions and feel free to express them without fear of reprimand in the form of heavy fines and unjust behaviours.  Ultimately, such behaviours would result in the freedom of speech being denied to the general public and in my opinion the bill is dangerous and unjustifiable.
