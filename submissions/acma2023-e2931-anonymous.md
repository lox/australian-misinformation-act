Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian people that it
does not trust us but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Who do they think they are! Do they
think they are wiser or better than us? Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is undemocratic and will prove devastating for
our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that
responsibility away. So much we hear from them, and the media is fiction and fear mongering. An informed and
discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its citizens from ideas. Australians must
exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them. That is totalitarianism

We are all prone to making mistakes. No one is infallible or able to be the sole source of truth, most definitely not a
group of unelected bureaucrats in Canberra. The thought that an unelected body has that level of discernment is a
joke.

This bill should be laughed out of existence.
