# Please DO NOT take steps to remove our rights to have an opinion, a discussion, to have a democracy, to reduce our VOICE, to give the government free reign to continue to lie and use propaganda to shove false information on us, unchecked and unaccountable. This is a massive step towards totalitarianism. Australians can surely manage to disseminate truth from lies, to have our opinions challenged, to use our own knowledge, enquiring minds, and common sense to make our decisions on what we believe and hold dear. God forbid, we go down a path of being made into brainless zombies, with zero autonomy, independent thought or rights. This is Australia. Isnâ€™t it???

 A supposed democratic country. Who do you think you are to decide for us what we can learn about, talk about?

 Our government is teaching our small children about anal sex, masterbation and more, destroying any chance at innocence. Don't perpetuate this madness by more interference in OUR LIVES.

 Butt out. Keep our children safe from online predators but leave us the hell alone from more governance.

 NO NO NO
