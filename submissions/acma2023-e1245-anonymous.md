As my submission to the inquiry into the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding this draft legislation.

Personally : I am Highly Disagreed Of This Bill because it will take away my Freedom Of
Speech.

Whilst some may believe that the solution to “misinformation” or “disinformation” is more centralised control, I believe that it is far
better to let people share their beliefs, respectfully disagree, debate on issues, and make up their own minds about matters.

This draft bill, however, will effectively shut down the sharing of many ideas and create so much legal uncertainty for online
platforms that they will be forced to censor anything which might be considered controversial.

This would be disastrous because throughout human history, hotly contested or even nearly universally disbelieved ideas have
turned out, years later, to be the truth. For example, many scientific discoveries now enshrined as facts – such as the spherical
Earth, the circulation of blood through the body, the sun as the centre of the solar system, etc. – were nearly unanimously
opposed by almost all the leading scientists of the time. Who is to say that similar things do not occur today?

This is why we cannot trust the ability of a mere handful people to make decisions about what should or should not be classed as
misinformation or disinformation – and why this draft bill must either be dumped or at least heavily revised to remedy the major
flaws it is built upon.

Yours sincerely,
