Dear Submissions group,

Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on Bill - submission regarding this proposed bill

I am grateful to have the opportunity to voice some of my concerns regarding this proposed
legisla�on.

  - While I understand some of the inten�ons of this bill and what government is hoping to
achieve, I am concerned that the bill does not provide enough checks, balances and required
scru�ny of ac�ons taken by ACMA when it comes to determining what is free speech and
what is misinforma�on/disinforma�on speech. Transparency and control are desperately
lacking in the bill.

  - Once again, this proposed Australian legisla�on is out of step with interna�onal legisla�on.
The UN Declara�on of Human Rights and the Interna�onal Covenant on Civil and Poli�cal
Rights are clear on fundamental freedom of speech and communica�on. This bill exerts what
I call an over-reach of government control on what is considered misinforma�on or
disinforma�on. The right to voice an opinion or cri�cise government is a democra�c freedom
we as Australians should have. This bill will certainly curtail that basic right.

  - As with other recent legisla�on in Australia, this bill is incredibly vague as to what is defined
as “harmful” speech and how this defini�on is arrived at. This vagueness does not protect
legi�mate speech, cri�cism and voicing of opinion in the public square. There is no
protec�on for people, organisa�ons, and groups in expressing their opinion or thoughts on
maters that pertain to life, society and government. There is a real concern that this bill will
silence those who have a right to speak out on public maters.

  - To require policing of this legisla�on by digital service providers when the bill itself has not
defined clearly what “harmful” speech is or what cons�tutes misinforma�on/disinforma�on
is irresponsible. The vagueness of the legisla�on will coerce digital service providers into
silencing everything that could see them breech the law. This will include legi�mate
informa�on, ideas, concerns, and viewpoints. This will silence freedom of speech.
Responsible and democra�cally elected government owe it to their ci�zens to ensure that
freedom of speech, freedom of associa�on and beliefs are upheld in legisla�on not silenced.

  - This legisla�on further exempts government from the same rules it is desiring to apply to the
public square. Government authorised content is therefore to be seen as the only truth on a
mater. This is self-defea�ng and borders on poli�cal control of what ci�zens can say or think
on public issues. The role of government must have the same checks and balances as those
imposed on its ci�zens. Without these checks and balances a government could be seen as
dicta�ng what the public must think and adhere to. This is not democracy.

  - Giving the ACMA power to compel digital pla�orms and private pla�orms to provide
informa�on and evidence about misinforma�on/disinforma�on is in my opinion a breech of
privacy. The vagueness of this bill’s defini�on of what is truly misinforma�on/disinforma�on
has the poten�al to see private individuals’ informa�on made available when in fact it should
be kept confiden�al. It is worrying that a government would require this and poten�ally
breech our own privacy laws. A clear framework with clear checks and balances needs to be
in the bill to ensure that privacy is not breeched.

  - There must be scru�ny, accountability, oversight and transparency to prevent the misuse of
censorship powers. This bill does not provide any such requirement or framework. I find it
hard to believe that this important aspect of this legisla�on is lacking. Without these checks

and balances the ACMA and government have the poten�al to over-reach the power given
them in this bill. This is definitely not democra�c, and it would be irresponsible for
government to enact this bill without this framework of accountability and scru�ny.

  - The proposed penal�es for failing to comply with the misinforma�on codes and standards is
excessive. I suspect they are made excessive in this bill to ensure digital service pla�orms are
“frightened” into submission. Given that digital service pla�orms are required to police this
legisla�on this could result in the complete shutdown of free speech on these pla�orms.
Once again, the vagueness of this bill and what cons�tutes legi�mate
misinforma�on/disinforma�on that is “harmful” will prevent legi�mate free speech. Without
scru�ny and accountability to control censorship, this bill is likely to cause more harm than
good, and I personally cannot agree with it. It is one thing to have good inten�ons, but a
totally different mater to implement well thought out legisla�on that actually meets the
requirements for which is created.

I sincerely hope that my concerns are considered, and this legisla�on is suitably improved or dropped
completely. In its current format this bill is more problema�c than of any good.
