**ABSTRACT: All-cause mortality by week in Australia shows that there**

was no detectable excess mortality 13 months into the declared

pandemic, followed by a step-wise increase in mortality in mid-April

2021, synchronous with the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine prioritizing

elderly, disabled and aboriginal residents. The excess mortality in the

vaccination period (mid-April 2021 through August 2022; 14 % larger

all-cause mortality than in recent pre-vaccination periods of same time

duration; 62 million administered vaccine doses) was 31±1 thousand

deaths, which is more than twice the deaths registered as from or with

COVID-19. In addition, a sharp peak in all-cause mortality (mid-January

to mid-February 2022; 2,600 deaths) is synchronous with the rapid

rollout of the booster (9.4 million booster doses, same time period), and

is not due to a climatic heatwave. We give thirteen numbered

arguments as to why we conclude that the excess mortality in Australia

is causally associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. The corresponding

vaccine injection fatality ratio (vIFR) is approximately 0.05 %, which we

compare to estimated vIFR values from the USA Vaccine Adverse

Event Reporting System (VAERS) and from all-cause mortality data for

India, Southern states of the USA, Michigan (USA) and Ontario

(Canada).

Australia experienced a significant and sustained increase in all-cause mortality, starting

with its COVID-19 vaccine rollout aimed at high-risk residents in mid-April 2021,

whereas it saw no detectable excess all-cause mortality up to that point during 13

months of a pandemic that was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on

11 March 2020.

Starting in mid-April 2021, the all-cause mortality per week in Australia shows a

sustained increase of >10 %, during which it never returns to its seasonal low value (of

approximately 3,000 deaths/week) and attains highs of >4,000 deaths/week in June
2


-----

July-August 2022. The step-wise increase in all-cause mortality remains large up to the

final date of presently consolidated official government statistics (week-34 of 2022,

week ending 28 August 2022) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022a).

Over the measured period of the step-wise increase in all-cause mortality (mid-April

2021 through August 2022; 14 % larger all-cause mortality than in recent pre
vaccination periods of same time duration; 62 million administered vaccine doses) there

are 31±1 thousand excess deaths of all causes in Australia, whereas no excess deaths

are detected in the prior 13-month period since a pandemic was declared (mid-March

2020 through mid-April 2021).

The excess all-cause mortality following the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (31,000 deaths,

mid-April 2021 through August 2022) is more than twice the total number of deaths

registered as being from or with COVID-19 (14,014 deaths, 1 January 2020 through

29 August 2022; WHO, consulted 20 December 2022,

https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/au).

The above points are corroborated and illustrated in the following figures.

**Australia. (Source: https://www.covid19data.com.au/vaccines, accessed 20 December 2022.)**

The step-wise increase in mortality is evident in Figure 1 (A through C), and it is

synchronous with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (Figures 2, 3 and 4).

The step-wise transition to a regime of larger all-cause mortality is also seen in the

different states of Australia. The example of Victoria is shown in Figure 4. The same

phenomenon occurs in the all-cause mortality of all the eight states of Australia,

although not clearly in NT (Northern Territory) (Appendix 1).

In addition to the above-described step-wise change in regime of all-cause mortality,

there is a prominent peak in all-cause mortality, having a full duration of seven weeks,

from mid-January to mid-February 2022. It is not consistent with a seasonal feature and

it is synchronous with a large burst in COVID-19 vaccine dose delivery (Figures 1, 3B

and 4), which was the rollout of the booster (3rd doses) in Australia. The said 7-week
duration peak in all-cause mortality is prominent in the states NSW, QLD and VIC, but is

essentially not present in the other states (Appendix 1). The booster rollout is shown in

the following Figures 5 and 6.

**Figure 5: Daily and cumulative booster (3rd doses) rollout in Australia. The time axis is from 10**

Direct comparisons between all-cause mortality by week for the mid-January to

mid-February 2022 peak and booster delivery by week are shown below, for Australia

and for the states NSW, VIC and QLD (Figures 6A through 6D).

The integrated excess mortality in the 7-week-duration peak, relative to its baseline, is

approximately 2,600 deaths, compared to approximately 9.4 million booster doses

delivered over the duration of the mortality peak. This corresponds to a vaccine injection

fatality ratio (vIFR) of approximately 0.03 %, which in turn is not too different from the

vIFR of 0.008 % for 65+ year old USA subjects injected with the Janssen vaccine,

calculated from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data by Hickey

and Rancourt (2022) (their Table 1).

An alternative hypothesis for the 7-week-duration mortality peak would be that it was

caused by an Australian summer heatwave affecting Eastern Australia. This hypothesis

is not tenable with the climatic and mortality data, which we demonstrate in Appendix 2.

For the following reasons (presented as numbered points), taken together, we conclude

that the 16-month (mid-April 2021 through August 2022) sustained regime of large

excess all-cause mortality in Australia may largely or predominantly be caused by its

vaccine rollout, including the booster (3rd doses).

1 - There is a clear temporal association between the new regime of heightened

all-cause mortality and the vaccine rollout, whereas Australia did not have detectable

excess mortality up to the start of the rollout, during 13 months of a pandemic that was

declared by the WHO on 11 March 2020. (Figures 1, 2, 4 and 6; and Appendix 1)

2 - The excess mortality in the vaccination period (mid-April 2021 through August 2022)

for Australia (all ages) is 31,000 (±1,000) deaths (Figure 1A), which is more than twice

the total number of deaths registered as being from or with COVID-19 (14,014 deaths, 1

January 2020 through week ending 29 August 2022; WHO, consulted 15 December

2022, https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/au).

Note that the percentage of total COVID-19-assigned deaths that are “with COVID-19”

(rather than “from COVID-19”) varies between approximately 10 % and 30 %, in the

period January 2022 through August 2022 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022b; their

figure entitled “Proportion of deaths from and with COVID-19 during the Omicron wave”,

and see “Proportion of deaths from and with COVID-19 during the Omicron wave by

state of registration”). Here, death “from COVID-19” means that COVID-19 is assigned

as “the underlying cause of death as the disease or condition that initiated the train of

morbid events leading to death”, whereas other diseases and conditions reported as

contributing to death are “referred to as associated causes” (Australian Bureau of

Statistics, 2022c). In fact, 95.4 % of deaths “from COVID-19” in Australian death

certificates had non-COVID-19 “causal sequences of events” and/or “pre-existing

chronic conditions” (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022c; their table entitled “Number

of deaths due to COVID-19 that has associated conditions”).

The question is unavoidable: Why would Australians suddenly (at the start of the

vaccine rollout) start dying in excess of something mostly if not entirely other than

COVID-19, after 13 months of a declared pandemic during which there was no

detectable excess all-cause mortality?

3 - The mean vIFR in the vaccination period (mid-April 2021 through August 2022) for

Australia, therefore, would be:

31 K deaths / 62 M vaccine doses[1] = 0.05 %

which is larger than the vIFR of 0.008 % for 65+ year old USA subjects injected with the

Janssen vaccine, calculated from the VAERS data (Hickey and Rancourt, 2022; their

Table 1), and smaller than the estimated 1 % calculated for the excess mortality event

in India (Rancourt, 2022), and for excess mortality peaks for several Southern states of

the USA (Rancourt et al., 2022). As such, the 0.05 % estimated mean vIFR for Australia

is within an expected range for real-world circumstances.

4 - In addition to the above-described vaccination-period regime of all-cause mortality

(mid-April 2021 through August 2022), there is a prominent peak in all-cause mortality

from mid-January to mid-February 2022, having a full duration of seven weeks, which is

synchronous with a large burst in COVID-19 vaccine dose delivery (Figures 1, 3B, 4 and

6). The said large burst in vaccine dose delivery was the rollout of the booster (3rd

doses) in Australia (Figures 5 and 6).

We stress that Figure 6, showing a high degree of synchronicity (in both position and

width) between the mid-January to mid-February 2022 all-cause mortality peak and the

booster (3rd doses) delivery pattern, with the booster delivery surge generally leading

the mortality surge by approximately 1 week, represents strong evidence for a causal

relation; the strongest we have seen in all-cause mortality data.

5 - The said prominent peak in all-cause mortality from mid-January to mid-February

2022 has an integrated excess mortality in its 7-week duration, relative to its baseline, of

approximately 2,600 deaths, compared to approximately 9.4 million booster doses

delivered over the duration of the mortality peak. This corresponds to a calculated vIFR

for the specific mortality peak:

2.6 K deaths / 9.4 M vaccine doses[2] = 0.03 %

which is comparable in value to that obtained (0.05 %) for the mean vIFR in the

vaccination period (mid-April 2021 through August 2022) for Australia.

6 - The impact of the rollout would be sudden, as observed (Figures 1, 2, 4A and 6; and

Appendix 1), because Australia prioritized elderly, disabled and aboriginal residents

(Australian Government - Department of Health and Aged Care, 2021).

7 - The step-wise increase in all-cause mortality, into the regime of excess all-cause

mortality (mid-April 2021 through August 2022) occurs simultaneously in mid-April 2021

across all of Australia, in the eight states (see Appendix 1), rather than showing any

distribution of starting times, which would be compatible with a spreading infectious

disease seeding different regions at different times and spreading at different rates

depending on regional differences of social and health conditions.

In this regard, theoretical models of spreading and emerging pandemics show high

sensitivity of dynamic outcomes to seeding, societal population size, and inferred social

and health conditions (Parham and Michael, 2011; Hasegawa and Nemoto, 2016; Ma et

al., 2022).

8 - The VAERS data of the USA unambiguously shows excess all-cause deaths

immediately following injections with each of the three types of COVID-19 vaccines

used in the USA, with a prominent peak within 5 days of injection and an exponentially

decaying excess mortality extending 2 months following injection (Hickey and Rancourt,

2022; see their Figs. S3 through S5). The integrated mortality by number of injections

following injection (injection toxicity or vIFR) increases exponentially with age, as does

the batch to batch variability of toxic effect (Hickey and Rancourt, 2022; see their

Fig. S6). The latter observations of exponential increases with age mean that the

injections represent fatal challenges in proportion to frailty of the subject.

9 - Detailed histopathological and immunohistochemical autopsy studies have

demonstrated that the COVID-19 vaccines are causes of death, both in otherwise

healthy subjects and in elderly subjects with comorbidities (Choi et al., 2021; Schneider

et al., 2021; Sessa et al., 2021; Gill et al., 2022; Mörz, 2022; Schwab et al., 2022;

Yoshimura et al., 2022).

10 - The Australian Government interprets both test results (cases) and the mortality as

occurring in four “waves”, which it describes by time period as follows (Australian

Bureau of Statistics, 2022b):

  - “Wave 1: as occurring between March and May 2020. The predominant variant during

Wave 1 was the original virus strain.

  - Wave 2: as occurring between June and November 2020. Wave 2 predominantly

occurred in Victoria. The variant during Wave 2 was the original virus strain.

  - Delta wave: as occurring between July and December 2021.

  - Omicron wave: as occurring during 2022 (until the end of September 2022). Due to the

length of this wave and the higher number of deaths […].”

We have not found any study establishing a scientific basis for the Australian

Government’s assignation of these waves. Furthermore, the said Government’s

assignation is irreconcilable with:

i. the absence of detected excess mortality in March-May 2020 (Figure 1; and

Appendix 1),

ii. the absence of detected excess mortality in Australia (Figure 1A) and in Victoria

(Figure 4A) in the period June-November 2020 (and see Appendix 1),

iii. a Delta-variant wave (July-December 2021) that would have missed both the

mid-April 2021 step-wise surge in excess all-cause mortality and the 7-week
duration mid-January to mid-February 2022 peak in excess all-cause mortality,

and

iv. an Omicron-variant wave (2022) that would have caused two distinct and

prominent features in excess all-cause mortality, namely the mid-January to

mid-February 2022 7-week-duration peak and the large surge that followed

starting in May 2022 (Figure 1A).

The official interpretive situation is similar, although less sophisticated, to that employed

by Dhar et al. (2021) who postulated that the April-July 2021 “second wave” event in

Delhi (the capital city of India) was due to the Delta variant, which would have quickly

20


-----

swept Delhi to become predominant because it would have higher transmissibility and

larger immune escape than concomitantly circulating variants. However, Dhar et al.

estimate the needed characteristics of Delta by fitting a model to the epidemiological

data and to the variant predominance estimated by genomic measurements from small

non-randomized cohorts. Leaving aside the large known and unknown uncertainties

throughout their exercise, basically, the inferred characteristics of Delta are obtained by

fitting to the data, rather than being independently measured in a controlled clinical trial.

Under such circumstances, the mortality event creates an illusion of the needed Delta

for Delhi, but an actual Delta cannot be concluded to have caused the mortality event.

Likewise, the Australian Government’s assignation of COVID-19 waves for Australia is

merely a naming exercise of reported test results (case statistics), coupled to sparse

and unreliable genomic measurements (Australian Government - Department of Health

and Aged Care, 2022). The Australian Government’s assignation is contradicted by

hard data of all-cause mortality by time.

11 - A similar synchronicity between vaccine dose delivery and excess all-cause

mortality is observed in connection with the so-called “vaccine equity” campaigns in the

USA. An anomalous fall-2021 peak was interpreted as being caused by the vaccines,

and is prominent in the 25-64 years age group in 21 states of the USA, most notably

including Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana (Rancourt et al., 2022).

The data for Mississippi is shown below (Figure 7).

21

**Figure 7: Rancourt et al. (2022), their Fig. 11B. All-cause mortality by week (light-blue), cumulated**
**number of people with at least one dose of vaccine (dark-blue), cumulated number of fully**
**vaccinated people (orange) and cumulated number of people with a booster dose (yellow) by week**
**from 2019 to 2022, for 25-64 years age group in Mississippi. Data are displayed from week-1 of**
**2019 to week-5 of 2022.**

In the study by Rancourt et al. (2022), it was concluded that significant (detectable by

all-cause mortality) vaccine-induced mortality occurred primarily among fragile groups,

characterized by high degrees of poverty, disability, obesity, diabetes, and high

medication rates. The vaccine injection was seen as an additional challenge, often

accelerating and causing death in residents with comorbidities.

12 - Another example of probably causal synchronicity between a rapid COVID-19

vaccine rollout prioritizing elderly, frail and disabled residents and large excess

all-cause mortality is that of India (Rancourt, 2022). In that case, the early rollout of the

vaccine in April-July 2021 was devastating, causing the deaths of approximately 3.7

million residents, on administering approximately 350 million doses of the vaccine (in a

population of 1.39 billion). This corresponds to an effective vIFR (per-dose toxicity) of

approximately 1 %. It is also approximately the same vIFR (1 %) as is consistent with

the anomalous fall-2021 peak in excess all-cause mortality occurring in high-poverty

22


-----

states of the USA, which was interpreted as being caused by the vaccine (Rancourt et

al., 2022; and see the data for Mississippi shown in Figure 7).

Clearly, frail residents are susceptible to being fatally harmed by the injection and

should be protected against state-run injection campaigns implemented without

stringent individual clinical risk assessment. It appears that the population-wide COVID
19 vIFR can be as large as 1 % (India, Southern USA states), and is approximately

0.05 % in Australia.

Both India and Australia had virtually no detectable excess all-cause mortality after a

pandemic was declared by the WHO, until their respective COVID-19 vaccine rollouts,

which makes the synchronicity association relatively easy to assign.

13 - Two more examples of synchronicity between a rapid COVID-19 vaccine rollout

prioritizing elderly and vulnerable residents and large excess all-cause mortality occur

for Michigan, USA (Rancourt et al., 2022) and Ontario, Canada.

Key figures for Michigan, USA are as follows (Figure 8). The COVID-19 vIFR in the

main rollout of the vaccine in Michigan is comparable in value to that for the vaccination

period for Australia (0.05 %).

A key figure for Ontario, Canada is as follows (Figure 9).

**dose of vaccine (dark-blue), cumulative number of fully vaccinated people (orange) and**
**cumulative number of people with a booster dose (purple) by week from 2010 to 2022 (upper**
**panel), and from 2019 to 2022 (lower panel), in the province of Ontario, Canada. Both mortality and**
**vaccination are for the age group 65-84 years. (Rancourt et al., manuscript in preparation)**

25


-----

A clear non-seasonal peak is seen in this age group (65-84 years) in Ontario, which is

synchronous with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to this age group (Figure 9); and a

particularly large and sharp mortality peak is synchronous with the booster rollout to this

age group the following winter season (Figure 9). Here, again, the corresponding

COVID-19 vIFRs are comparable in value to that for the vaccination period for Australia

(0.05 %).

As further discussion, we make the following observations and comments.

As outlined above, less than and approximately half of the excess deaths of all causes

in the vaccination period are deaths registered as COVID-19 deaths. The COVID-19
registered deaths have the following properties (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022c):

i. Attribution of death “from COVID-19” versus “with COVID-19” is based

on a qualitative evaluation susceptible to bias

ii. 95.4 % of deaths “from COVID-19” in Australian death certificates had

non-COVID-19 “causal sequences of events” and/or “pre-existing

chronic conditions”

iii. The deaths statistics by age and sex are typical of all-cause old-age

deaths statistics in Western societies

iv. The three “most commonly certified acute disease outcomes of

COVID-19” were: pneumonia (61.4 %), respiratory failure (15 %), and

other infections (11.2 %)

v. The three most common pre-existing conditions in certified “with

COVID-19” deaths were: chronic cardiac conditions (39.0 %), dementia

(30.5 %), and chronic respiratory conditions (17.8 %)

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the vaccine injections caused death by providing

an additional and significant challenge to already chronically frail or vulnerable subjects,

26


-----

and that COVID-19 itself may not have provided a significant contribution, as we already

demonstrated for the Southern states of the USA (Rancourt et al., 2022), and as is

apparent for India (Rancourt, 2022).

In this context, and given the “most commonly certified acute disease outcomes of

COVID-19”, it is important to note that Australia, like virtually all Western jurisdictions,

dramatically reduced its antibiotic prescriptions after a pandemic was declared by the

WHO (Gillies et al., 2021; Rancourt et al., 2022). This would mean that, not only were

chronically frail residents challenged with the toxic injections, but they may also not

have been provided the normal treatments against respiratory bacterial infections.

Finally, we note that there is starting to be some acknowledgement in the mainstream

media suggesting that vaccine harm in Australia may be much larger than generally

admitted by the medical establishment. The recent public testimony and submission to

Parliament of former federal MP and former Australian Medical Association (AMA)

president Dr. Kerryn Phelps stands out in this regard (Chung, 2022).

In conclusion, the declared pandemic would have had to entirely spare Australia any

detectable deaths for more than a year, while it raged in many other places around the

world, before it showed any virulence, suddenly in mid-April 2021, when vaccines

coincidentally were being rolled out to the elderly and most vulnerable. In addition, a

sharp peak in all-cause mortality (mid-January to mid-February 2022) would be

synchronous with the rapid deployment of the vaccine booster (3rd doses) purely by

coincidence, without any explanation (plausible or not) being provided.

On the contrary, our analysis leads us to conclude that the excess mortality in the

vaccination period (31±1 thousand deaths, mid-April 2021 through August 2022; 14 %

larger all-cause mortality than in recent pre-vaccination periods of same time duration;

62 million administered vaccine doses), which is more than twice the deaths registered

as from or with COVID-19, and the sharp peak in all-cause mortality (mid-January to

27


-----

mid-February 2022; 2,600 deaths), which is synchronous with the rapid rollout of the

booster (9.4 million booster doses, same time period) are causally associated with the

COVID-19 vaccine. We give thirteen numbered arguments as to why we make this

conclusion.

The corresponding vaccine injection fatality ratio (vIFR) is approximately 0.05 %, which

is intermediate between the value from VAERS for ages 65+ years with the Janssen

vaccine in the USA (0.008 %) and the value for India’s vaccine rollout and for Southern

states of the USA subjected to “vaccine equity” campaigns (1 %).

Of course, this is diametrically opposite to the proposal that the COVID-19 vaccine

would have saved any lives; a proposal that is not substantiated by extensive study of

all-cause mortality data (Rancourt et al., 2022).

# APPENDIX 1: 
### Step-wise increase in all-cause mortality occurs in mid-April 2021 in all the states in Australia

Here, we show the all-cause mortality data for Australia and for each state of Australia

(as labelled in the panels of Figure A1-F1), and including the 72-week vaccination

period integrations, described in the present article.

We also provide the following table of corresponding vaccine-period excess mortalities.

- The baseline-period 72-week-integrated mortality was estimated from an inspection of the
values on the graphs (Figure A1-F1) for periods prior to the vaccination period, in such a way as
to be representative of the value that would be predicted in the absence of the vaccination
campaign and its effects.

# APPENDIX 2: 
### Mid-January to mid-February 2022 mortality peak not caused by a heatwave

This appendix is concerned with the question of whether the mid-January to

mid-February 2022 prominent peak in all-cause mortality in Australia (occurring in NSW,

VIC and QLD; see Appendix 1) can be due to a climatic heatwave.

It is important to address this question because sharp all-cause mortality peaks are

often associated with exceptional summer heatwaves in mid-latitude countries (e.g.

Rancourt et al., 2022, cited in the present article).

The most important heatwave to affect Eastern Australia over more than the last three

decades was in 2009. The government report [Australian Government - Bureau of

Meteorology, Special Climate Statement 17: The exceptional January-February 2009

heatwave in south-eastern Australia (issued 4 February 2009, updated 12 February

2009), http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17d.pdf, accessed 18

December 2022] describes it this way:

“An exceptional heatwave affected south-eastern Australia during late January and early
February 2009. The most extreme conditions occurred in northern and eastern
Tasmania, most of Victoria and adjacent border areas of New South Wales, and
southern South Australia, with many records set both for high day and night time
temperatures as well as for the duration of extreme heat.

There were two major episodes of exceptional high temperatures, from 28-31 January
and 6-8 February, with slightly lower but still very high temperatures persisting in many
inland areas through the period in between.”

This exceptional 2009 heatwave did not cause any significant peak in all-cause

mortality, as shown in Figure A2-F1, below. In fact, heatwaves essentially do not cause

peaks in all-cause mortality in Australia, presumably because it’s always hot in the

38


-----

summers. Figure A2-F1 does not show any peaks, 1980-2022, which could be

interpreted as summer heatwave peaks.

Also, there are no Australian Government, Bureau of Meteorology, Special Climate

Statements (SCSs) 2006-2022, which can be interpreted to be associated with or

similarly associated to the mid-January to mid-February 2022 prominent peak in

all-cause mortality occurring in Eastern Australia (NSW, VIC, QLD) (see Appendix 1).

See the list of SCSs here: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/ . Archived

on 18 December 2022 here: https://archive.vn/WDlPA

And the Australian Government, Bureau of Meteorology, “Monthly Weather Review,

Australia, January 2022” report [Product code IDCKGC1AR1. Prepared on 27 April

2022. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/mwr/aus/mwr-aus-202201.pdf ] makes no mention

of any climate or weather event that could be associated with the mid-January to

mid-February 2022 prominent peak in all-cause mortality occurring in Eastern Australia

(NSW, VIC, QLD).

That the 2022 all-cause mortality peak of concern is not due to a heatwave is again

corroborated by the fourteen maximum daily temperature maps for Australia shown

below, for the years and dates as indicated on the maps.

[Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ . Specifically:

http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/temp/rmse_archive.jsp?map=maxave&period=daily&y

ear=2022&month=1&day=12 ]

The mid-January to mid-February 2022 prominent peak in all-cause mortality occurring

in Eastern Australia (NSW, VIC, QLD) (see Appendix 1) — seen in Figure A2-F1 and in

Figures 1, 2, 4A and 6 of the present article — is not due to any climate, weather or

temperature event or anomaly.
