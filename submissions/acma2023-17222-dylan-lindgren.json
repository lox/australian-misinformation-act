      "The legislation could have anti-competitive effects, favoring large digital platforms and stifling smaller competitors.",
      "Existing laws, such as the News Media Bargaining Code, are not fit for addressing misinformation and disinformation challenges.",

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "I could not be more opposed to a bill. It is naive, reckless, and incredibly damaging to the global free and open Internet.",
      "The law is so ignorantly broad that it feels akin to the Australian government setting a speed limit on every road around the globe.",
      "The concept of extraterritoriality, along with the scope of the digital services that this law applies to, is a completely unworkable concept.",
      "It is an impossible task to accurately judge what is true or untrue. There is always new information being discovered which contradicts what was once widely accepted fact."
