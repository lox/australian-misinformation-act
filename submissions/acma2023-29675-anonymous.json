      "It is my sincere opinion that the Aus Governmentâ€™s Misinformation bill is a poorly drafted piece of proposed legislation that poses a threat to the rights of free expression, self-determination, and freedom of thought, conscience and religion.",
      "This bill places unacceptable restrictions on individuals posting content online, while excusing government and the press from the same standards.",
      "If such law is allowed to pass, it will not only signal the death knell of the internet as a free marketplace of ideas in Australia, but it will signal to Australian citizens, and to citizens of the globe, that the Australian Government seeks total control of the dissemination of information within its borders."
