**NO GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE WHAT IS TRUE, AND THEN FORBID ANY DISCUSSION OF IT.**
Our Law Courts require us to “Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” That is a good rule,
and we all need to insist that private people, our businesses, and our public media must also obey it.

To do that, they need to first seek out and consider all of the facts that are accessible to them, in a balanced
way.  They must also be open to adjusfing their view when extra facts become known to them.

Daily experience in our parliaments and in our law courts shows that differing opinions can be honestly and
sincerely held. They should be respected.

However, many people are not willing to examine all of the relevant known facts, and weigh up the pros and
the cons. Sadly, in the last few decades we have seen a definite increase in the number of people who are
unwilling to think deeply on a subject. Instead, they are latching onto some shallow view that excites them,
without undertaking any serious study of the whole subject. They then refuse to engage in unbiassed
debate, and it becomes their ideology. This muzzles the truth. It produces warped viewpoints, that in effect
become lies, that do more harm than good. This is very bad for our nafion.

We are seeing this happening more and more, as the big media giants around the world propagate biased
views on various subjects – and not necessarily because they think it is true, but just because there are
people who will pay money for informafion that is slanted that way.

Polifics is a very obvious one. The “global warming” issue (decepfively referred to as “climate change”, which
is a quite different mafter), is another. The whole issue of pornography is another.  Aberrant sex is another.
But if anyone openly menfions its problems, they are branded “homophobes” who are aftacking them with
“hate speech”—neither of which accusafions is true. (One of the Ten Commandments says that you must
not tell lies about your fellow-man. The Woke people are doing it all the fime.)

Such people are demanding that they be given freedoms which they then refuse to give to anyone who
disagrees with them. They have already lost all sense of democracy, and the right to freedom of speech, and
have become authoritarian dictators. But you can never have a free and democrafic society unless you allow
open respecfful discussion of all the known facts, and try to get to the truth, if there is any disagreement.

Yet
the head of a university linguisfic department I know claims proudly to be an “ALLY” of the LBTQI etc
movement, and rejected my claims, as if they were not true. Obviously her view of “truth” is quite irrafional.

After having established all of the relevant facts on a subject, there can be sfill be different opinions as to the
best course of acfion to take in any given circumstances. Those different opinions must then be respected,
weighed up, and discussed freely between reasonable, rafional people. That is why we need parliaments.

No government must ever impose restricfions on what intelligent people are allowed to say.  Otherwise
Australia will be locked into a dictatorship, against its consfitufion, against its will, and without its consent.
China would love nothing befter!
