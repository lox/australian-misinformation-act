I write regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

In the study of history, it is clearly seen that the first step towards tyranny is the
stripping of free speech from the _hoi_ _polloi._ Whether the established authority
demanding the silence of the masses is the church or state, knowledge expansion is
stifled. Some examples of tyranny perpetrators are:- the inquisition, Hitler, Stalin, Pol
Pot, and examples of victims of censorship:- Socrates, Galileo, Martin Luther,
Bertrand Russell and Martin Luther King Jr.

There is nothing to commend this proposed bill.

It is now public knowledge that most of the government mandated medical protocols
used for covid 19 lacked scientific merit. The restriction of the free flow of information
from credentialled medical professionals led to questionable and dangerous
treatment protocols that cost the lives of many citizens.

The experiences of the last three years demonstrate how dangerous, to the “greater
good” is the restriction of free speech.

Would the Labor government want this Bill to be made law and, in the future, used
against their members and their political ideology if an extreme right-wing
government was elected? Labor is rarely in government for more than one term.

Let us do a thought experiment. Imagine this law was in place, and that social media
was the town square during the Howard government. All assertions on social media
that the narrative of “weapons of mass destruction” in Iraq was a lie, would be
labelled disinformation and suppressed.

Simply put, if we don’t have free speech, we don’t have a democracy.
