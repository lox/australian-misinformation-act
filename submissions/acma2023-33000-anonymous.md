## New ACMA powers with misinformation and disinformation. New ACMA powers with misinformation and disinformation.New ACMA powers with misinformation and disinformation.New ACMA powers with misinformation and disinformation.

 To combat misinformation and disinformation requires first and foremost that one knows the truth, and clearly nobody does.

 So, just who decides what is misinformation and disinformation in any given situation? To be fair, this will be impossible to achieve.

 We know from the propaganda on the regular media that successive Australian governments have been directly and indirectly imposing their viewpoint on Australians for years.

 This draft Act of legislation is an insult to people’s intelligence as it directly reflects the failure of the government narrative during the recent covid event, to mislead the public about disease and “vaccines”; so now they seek remedy by imposing censorship on dissenting voices. Thus implying that this will be needed between now, and when they next drive fear into the hearts and minds of this nation with another “emergency” event.

 Talk about scamming the Australian people!

 The scale of this type of behaviour was best revealed by the Twitter files, and what was described as the Virality Project, where government, media, Big Tech and academia colluded to mislead the public over vaccines.

 It is obvious that controlled media (TV, radio, etc) can and will manipulate information to fit their particular needs, agenda, or obligations. Whereas free public arenas enable all viewpoints to be aired without a prescribed narrative driving the outcome or answer that some special interest group or authority wishes. Free speech enables all individuals to be heard equally, no matter how anyone feels about that opinion.

 I’m sure individuals are constantly being misinformed, especially by all manner of advertising, publications, and communication platforms, with set agendas to promote. This will always occur where freedom of speech prevails, otherwise any censorship is naturally biased and deigns any sort of balanced debate or view.

## Seeking the truth in any matter is almost impossible because even regular science is now questionable, and just follows the money like everything else today. Dare I say, even this draft Act has questionable motive.

 What are the real motives and benefits to this misuse of power by the ACMA? Obviously censorship, and manipulation of information to further the aims of some elite groups in high society. They will entrench still more the “nanny-state” mentality of this country, and enable more lies by public figures that will not be revealed until too late, as with the whole covid19 scam and deceit, at all levels of government, which of course, they refuse to investigate or denounce.

 We are seeing too much perceived democracy in this country, and what is really missing is true liberty for the individual.

 I hereby denounce this Act as a direct attack on the liberties of all living individuals, and that it be scrapped. All the people involved in formulating this should be ashamed of themselves, particularly after what has transpired in the last 3 years.  As with so many governmental initiatives that are happening, this response will, along with all others that are in disagreement, be ignored and the Act will be encouraged to proceed regardless.  I wonder if you will prove me wrong?
