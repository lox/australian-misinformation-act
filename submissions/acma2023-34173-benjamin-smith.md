Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

Please find below my feedback on the exposure draft of the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 (the Bill).

I am opposed to this Bill which would allow the Australian Communications
and Media Authority to censor, control and define free speech in Australia.
That any agency could define truth (the alternative to misinformation or
disinformation) is repugnant. Stifling debate stifles knowledge, innovation
and fact finding and can lead to discontent on one hand and an overall
narrowed intelligence on the other.

The Bill as it stands allows sweeping powers to the ACMA to govern all forms
of media with the exception of professional news content, accredited
educational institutions, governmental bodies and those producing
entertainment, parody or satire. I must say I am glad that comedians are
protected in this Bill, but the huge concern is that it gives power to bodies
that already carry it and takes power away from individuals who may hold
them to account.

This Bill effectively protects the opinion of the Government, educational
institutions and the press from community debate. This on it's own would
most likely create harm in the community. The opinions and information
issued by Governmental bodies, educational institutions and the press need
challenging in a healthy society especially where such bodies are often
beholden to their own political and commercial masters. That they be held as
the benchmark for 'truth' is deeply concerning for if history proves correct
'truth' is a moveable feast.

If we paraphrase Karl Popper, a statement can only be considered scientific if
it were open to being disproved. The act of challenging an idea can either
add to the weight of the theory or disprove it. Denying free speech and
debate through censorship will stagnate the collective intelligence of society,
not improve it.

Government and media in particular are well known to publish and
disseminate information which is designed to manipulate. Educational
institutions can be corrupted by commercial and political pressures.
Protecting such entities may introduce more societal harm than protection.
