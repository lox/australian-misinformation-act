## The common law

3.1 Freedom of speech has been characterised as one of the ‘fundamental values
protected by the common law’[1] and as ‘the freedom par excellence; for without it, no
other freedom could survive’.[2]

3.2 This chapter discusses the source and rationale of the common law right of
freedom of speech;[ 3] how this right is protected from statutory encroachment; and when
laws that interfere with freedom of speech may be considered justified, including by
reference to the concept of proportionality.[4]

3 Heydon J has observed that ‘there are many common law rights of free speech’ in the sense that the
common law recognises a ‘negative theory of rights’ under which rights are marked out by ‘gaps in the
criminal law’: Attorney-General (South Australia) v Corporation of the City of Adelaide (2013) 249 CLR
1, [145].

3.3 The High Court of Australia has stated that freedom of speech ‘is a common law
freedom’ and that it ‘embraces freedom of communication concerning government and
political matters’:

The common law has always attached a high value to the freedom and particularly in
relation to the expression of concerns about government or political matters … The
common law and the freedoms it encompasses have a constitutional dimension. It has
been referred to in this Court as ‘the ultimate constitutional foundation in Australia’.[5]

3.4 In Australian law, particular protection is given to political speech. Australian
law recognises that free speech on political matters is necessary for our system of
representative government:

Freedom of communication in relation to public affairs and political discussion cannot
be confined to communications between elected representatives and candidates for
election on the one hand and the electorate on the other. The efficacy of representative
government depends also upon free communication on such matters between all
persons, groups and other bodies in the community.[6]

3.5 Free speech or free expression is also understood to be an integral aspect of a
person’s right of self-development and fulfilment.[7] Professor Eric Barendt writes that
freedom of speech is ‘closely linked to other fundamental freedoms which reflect ...
what it is to be human: freedoms of religion, thought, and conscience’.[8]

3.6 This freedom is intrinsically important, and also serves a number of broad
objectives:

First, it promotes the self-fulfilment of individuals in society. Secondly, in the famous
words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), ‘the best test of truth is the power of
the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market’. Thirdly, freedom
of speech is the lifeblood of democracy. The free flow of information and ideas
informs political debate. It is a safety valve: people are more ready to accept decisions
that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them. It acts as a brake
on the abuse of power by public officials. It facilitates the exposure of errors in the
governance and administration of justice of the country.[9]

3.7 Freedom of speech has, of course, been defended and advocated in the works of
leading philosophers and jurists from Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, [10] John Milton

Dworkin and Eric Barendt in the 20th century.[13]

## Protections from statutory encroachment
#### Australian Constitution

3.8 Beginning with a series of cases in 1992,[14] the High Court has recognised that
freedom of political communication is implied in the Australian Constitution. This
freedom ‘enables the people to exercise a free and informed choice as electors’.[15] The
_Constitution has not been found to protect free speech more broadly._

3.9 The Constitution does not protect a personal right, but rather, the freedom acts
as a restraint on the exercise of legislative power by the Commonwealth.[16]

The freedom is to be understood as addressed to legislative power, not rights, and as
effecting a restriction on that power. Thus the question is not whether a person is
limited in the way that he or she can express himself or herself, although identification
of that limiting effect may be necessary to an understanding of the operation of a
statutory provision upon the freedom more generally. The central question is: how
does the impugned law affect the freedom?[17]

3.10 The freedom is not absolute. For one thing, it only protects some types of
speech—political communication.[18] In Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation it
was held that the freedom is ‘limited to what is necessary for the effective operation of
that system of representative and responsible government provided for by the
_Constitution’.[19]_

form of the right to freedom of speech is shared by the United States and other common law countries,
where ‘constitutional rights are thought to have an exclusively negative cast’: Adrienne Stone, ‘The

by providing for the fundamental features of representative government’: Lange v Australian
_Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520, 557. Sections 7 and 24 do not ‘confer personal rights on_
individuals. Rather they preclude the curtailment of the protected freedom by the exercise of legislative or
executive power’: Ibid 560.
18 Political communication includes ‘expressive conduct’ capable of communicating a political or
government message to those who witness it: Levy v Victoria (1997) 189 CLR 579.

60 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.11 While the scope of the implied freedom is open to some interpretation, it does
not appear to extend to non-political communication and non-federal communications
concerning discrete state issues.[20]

3.12 Chief Justice French has advocated a broader understanding of the meaning of
‘political communications’ to include ‘matters potentially within the purview of
government’,[21] but this interpretation has not commanded support of a majority of the
High Court.[22]

3.13 In Lange, the High Court formulated a two-step test to determine whether a law
burdens the implied freedom. As modified in Coleman v Power,[23] the test involves
asking two questions:

1. Does the law, in its terms, operation or effect, effectively burden freedom of
communication about government or political matters?

2. If the law effectively burdens that freedom, is the law nevertheless reasonably
appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner which is compatible
with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and
responsible government, and the procedure prescribed by s 128 of the Constitution for
submitting a proposed amendment of the Constitution to the informed decision of the
people?[24]

3.14 The limited scope of the communications covered by the implied freedom are
illustrated by the decision of the High Court in APLA Ltd v Legal Services
_Commissioner (NSW).[25] This concerned whether prohibitions, in NSW legislation, on_
advertising by barristers and solicitors offended the Constitution. The High Court held
that the prohibitions were not constitutionally invalid.

3.15 Kirby J, in dissent, held that as a matter of basic legal principle, a protected
freedom of communication arises to protect the integrity and operation of the judicial
branch of government, just as it does with regard to the legislature and executive
branch.[26] The laws in question, he said, amounted to ‘an impermissible attempt of State
law to impede effective access to Ch III courts and to State courts exercising federal

20 See George Williams and David Hume, Human Rights under the Australian Constitution (OUP, 2nd ed,
2013) 184. However, the High Court has stated that the ‘complex interrelationship between levels of
government, issues common to State and federal government and the levels at which political parties
operate necessitate that a wide view be taken of the operation of the freedom of political communication’:
_Unions NSW v New South Wales (2013) 304 ALR 266, [25]._
21 _Hogan v Hinch (2011) 243 CLR 506, [49]. French CJ has said that the ‘class of communication protected_
by the implied freedom in practical terms is wide’: Attorney-General for South Australia v Corporation of
_the City of Adelaide (2013) 249 CLR 1, 43 [67] (French CJ). The case left open the possibility that_
religious preaching may constitute ‘political communication’.

jurisdiction’, which ‘cannot stand with the text, structure and implications of the
Constitution’.[27]

3.16 The constitutionality of provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth), concerning using
a postal or similar service to menace, harass or cause offence, [28] was considered by the
High Court in Monis v The Queen.[29]

3.17 The High Court divided equally on whether s 471.12 of the Criminal Code
exceeded the limits of the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament because
it impermissibly burdens freedom of communication about government or political
matters.[30]

3.18 Three judges held that the provision was invalid on the basis that preventing
offence through a postal or similar service was not a ‘legitimate end’, as referred to in
the Lange test.[31] The other judges read down s 471.12 as being ‘confined to more
seriously offensive communications’ and aimed at the legitimate end of preventing a
degree of offensiveness that would provoke a more heightened emotional or
psychological response by a victim.[32] Read this way, the law went no further than was
reasonably necessary to achieve its protective purpose. [33]

3.19 The freedom of political communication doctrine in Australia applies to a
narrower range of speech, as compared to protections in other countries (including the
United States, Canada, the UK and New Zealand). Australia is the only democratic
country that does not expressly protect freedom of speech in its ‘national Constitution
or an enforceable national human rights instrument’.[34]

#### Principle of legality

3.20 The principle of legality provides some further protection to freedom of
speech.[35] When interpreting a statute, courts will presume that Parliament did not
intend to interfere with freedom of speech, unless this intention was made
unambiguously clear.[36]

62 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.21 For example, in Attorney-General (South Australia) v Corporation of the City of
_Adelaide, French CJ said:_

The common law freedom of expression does not impose a constraint upon the
legislative powers of the Commonwealth or the States or Territories. However,
through the principle of legality, and criteria of reasonable proportionality, applied to
purposive powers, the freedom can inform the construction and characterisation, for
constitutional purposes, of Commonwealth statutes. It can also inform the
construction of statutes generally and the construction of delegated legislation made in
the purported exercise of statutory powers. As a consequence of its effect upon
statutory construction, it may affect the scope of discretionary powers which involve
the imposition of restrictions upon freedom of speech and expression.[37]

3.22 In Monis, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ held:

The principle of legality is known to both the Parliament and the courts as a basis for
the interpretation of statutory language. It presumes that the legislature would not
infringe rights without expressing such an intention with ‘irresistible clearness’. The
same approach may be applied to constitutionally protected freedoms. In such a
circumstance it may not be necessary to find a positive warrant for preferring a
restricted meaning, save where an intention to restrict political communication is plain
(which may result in invalidity). A meaning which will limit the effect of the statute
on those communications is to be preferred.[38]

#### International law

3.23 International instruments provide for freedom of expression including the right,
under art 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to
‘seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers’. [39]

The UN Human Rights Committee provides a detailed list of forms of communication
that should be free from interference:

Political discourse, commentary on one’s own and on public affairs, canvassing,
discussion of human rights, journalism, cultural and artistic expression, teaching and
religious discourse.[40]

3.24 The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law stated that common law ‘protection
of free speech at the Commonwealth level essentially dates back to 1992, and is very
limited compared with the equivalent protection under international law’.[41]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 63

3.25 International instruments cannot be used to ‘override clear and valid provisions
of Australian national law’.[42] However, where a statute is ambiguous, courts will
generally favour a construction that accords with Australia’s international
obligations.[43]

#### Bills of rights

3.26 In other countries, bills of rights or human rights statutes provide some
protection to certain rights and freedoms. Bills of rights and human rights statutes
protect free speech in the United States,[44] United Kingdom,[45] Canada[46] and New
Zealand.[47] For example, the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) gives effect to the
provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, art 10 of which provides:

Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to
hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by
public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from
requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.[48]

3.27 This legislative right may not necessarily be different from the freedom
recognised at common law: several members of the House of Lords expressed the
opinion ‘that in the field of freedom of speech there was in principle no difference
between English law on the subject and article 10 of the Convention’.[49]

3.28 The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides significant
protection to free speech. In New York Times v Sullivan, Brennan J spoke of a
‘profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be
uninhibited, robust and wide open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and
sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials’.[50]

3.29 There are also protections for free speech in the Victorian Charter of Human
_Rights and Responsibilities and the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT).[51]_

## Laws that interfere with freedom of speech

3.30 A wide range of Commonwealth laws may be seen as interfering with freedom
of speech and expression, broadly conceived. Some of these laws impose limits on
freedom of speech that have long been recognised by the common law, for example, in
relation to obscenity and sedition. Arguably, such laws do not encroach on the

64 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

traditional freedom, but help define it. However, these traditional limits are crucial to
understanding the scope of the freedom, and possible justifications for new
restrictions.[52]

3.31 Commonwealth laws prohibit, or render unlawful, speech or expression in many
different contexts, and include:

- criminal laws;

- secrecy laws;

- contempt laws;

- anti-discrimination laws;

- media, broadcasting and telecommunications laws;

- information laws; and

- intellectual property laws.[53]

3.32 These laws are summarised below. Some of the justifications that have been
advanced for laws that interfere with freedom of speech, and public criticisms of laws
on that basis, are also discussed.

#### Criminal laws

3.33 A number of offences directly criminalise certain forms of speech or expression.
Some of these have ancient roots in treason and sedition, which since feudal times
punished acts deemed to constitute a violation of a subject’s allegiance to his or her
lord or monarch.

3.34 Following the demise of the absolute monarchy and the abolition of the Star
Chamber by the Long Parliament in 1641, the law of sedition was developed in the
common law courts. Seditious speech may, therefore, be seen as falling outside the
scope of traditional freedom of speech. However, the historical offence of sedition
would now be seen as a ‘political’ crime, punishing speech that is critical of the
established order. Prohibiting mere criticism of government that does not incite
violence reflects an antiquated view of the relationship between the state and society,
which would no longer be considered justified.[54]

52 In fact, freedom of speech has been said to represent the ‘limits of the duty not to utter defamation,
blasphemy, obscenity, and sedition’: Glanville Williams, ‘The Concept of Legal Liberty’ [1956]
_Columbia Law Review 1129, 1130. See also Ch 1._
53 Other laws that interfere with freedom of speech include the uniform defamation laws: Defamation Act
_2005 (NSW); Defamation Act 2005 (Qld); Defamation Act 2005 (SA); Defamation Act 2005 (Tas);_
_Defamation Act 2005 (Vic); Defamation Act 2005 (WA); Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 (ACT) ch 9;_
_Defamation Act 2006 (NT). As this Inquiry is concerned with Commonwealth laws, it will not be_
considering the operation of these state and territory laws.
54 Australian Law Reform Commission, Fighting Words: A Review of Sedition Laws in Australia, ALRC
Report 104 (2006) rec 3–1. This followed an earlier recommendation of the Gibbs Committee that, given
its similarity to the then existing treason offence, the offence of treachery should be repealed and a new
provision created, making it an offence for an Australian citizen or resident to help a state or any armed
force against which any part of the Australian Defence Force is engaged in armed hostilities: See


-----

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 65

3.35 Offences that may restrict speech or expression include the modern offences of
treason, urging violence, and advocating terrorism contained in the following
provisions of the Criminal Code (Cth):

- s 80.1AA (Treason—materially assisting enemies);

- s 80.2 (Urging violence against the Constitution);

- s 80.2A (Urging violence against groups);

- s 80.2B (Urging violence against members of groups); and

- s 80.2C (Advocating terrorism).

3.36 In addition, the offence of treachery contained in s 24AA of the Crimes Act
_1914 (Cth) covers the doing of any act or thing with intent: to overthrow the_
_Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage; or to overthrow by force_
or violence the established government of the Commonwealth, of a state or of a
proclaimed country. In 2006, in the context of its review of sedition laws, the ALRC
recommended that the treachery offence be reviewed to consider whether it merited
retention, modernisation and relocation to the Criminal Code.

3.37 There are other terrorism-related offences that may involve speech or
expression, such as providing training connected with terrorism, making documents
likely to facilitate terrorism, and directing the activities of, recruiting for, or providing
support to a terrorist organisation.[55] The power to prescribe an organisation as a
‘terrorist organisation’ under div 102 of the Criminal Code—which triggers a range of
these offences—may also be seen as infringing rights to freedom of speech.[56]

3.38 Counter-terrorism offences were criticised in some submissions on the grounds
that their potential interference with freedom of speech is not justified.[57]

In the context of counter terrorism, the pursuit of national security is quintessentially a
legitimate aim. However, a number of provisions risk burdening free speech in a
disproportionate way. The chilling effect of disproportionate free speech offences
should not be underestimated, nor should the normalising effect of gradually limiting
free speech over successive pieces of legislation.[58]

**_Advocating terrorism_**

3.39 A number of stakeholders submitted, for example, that the scope of the
‘advocating terrorism’ offences in s 80.2C of the Criminal Code is an unjustified
encroachment on freedom of speech.[59]

66 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.40 Section 80.2C makes it an offence if a person advocates the doing of a terrorist
act, or the commission of a terrorism offence, and is reckless as to whether another
person will engage in that conduct as a consequence. A person ‘advocates’ the doing of
a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence if the person ‘counsels,
promotes, encourages or urges’ the doing of it. A defence is provided covering, for
example, pointing out ‘in good faith any matters that are producing, or have a tendency
to produce, feelings of ill-will or hostility between different groups, in order to bring
about the removal of those matters’.[60]

3.41 In relation to proportionality in restricting freedom of expression, the statement
of compatibility with human rights stated:

The criminalisation of behaviour which encourages terrorist acts or the commission of
terrorism offences is a necessary preventative mechanism to limit the influence of
those advocating violent extremism and radical ideologies.[61]

3.42 The parameters of the offence were considered by the Parliamentary Joint
Committee on Human Rights (the Human Rights Committee) and the Senate Standing
Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills (the Scrutiny of Bills Committee) in their
deliberations on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill
2014.[62]

3.43 The Human Rights Committee concluded that the provision was ‘likely to be
incompatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression’.[63] In reaching this
conclusion the Human Rights Committee noted that a number of existing provisions in
the Criminal Code contain offences that may apply to speech that incites violence and
expressed concern that, despite the good faith defences, this offence was ‘overly broad’
in its application:

This is because the proposed offence would require only that a person is ‘reckless’ as
to whether their words will cause another person to engage in terrorism (rather than
the person ‘intends’ that this be the case). The committee is concerned that the offence
could therefore apply in respect of a general statement of support for unlawful
behaviour (such as a campaign of civil disobedience or acts of political protest) with
no particular audience in mind. For example, there are many political regimes that
may be characterised as oppressive and non-democratic, and people may hold
different opinions as to the desirability or legitimacy of such regimes; the committee
is concerned that in such cases the proposed offence could criminalise legitimate
(though possibly contentious or intemperate) advocacy of regime change, and thus
impermissibly limit free speech.[64]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 67

3.44 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee highlighted the definition of ‘advocates’ and
stated that this is a broad definition that ‘may therefore amount to an undue trespass on
personal rights and liberties as it is not sufficiently clear what the law prohibits, and
have a ‘chilling effect on the exercise of the right of free expression’.[65] It also noted
existing offences in the Criminal Code which may already cover conduct intended to
be captured by the proposed offence.[66]

3.45 The Attorney-General responded to these concerns by emphasising that terrorist
offences generally require a person to have three things: the capability to act, the
motivation to act, and the imprimatur to act (for example, endorsement from a person
with authority).

The new advocating terrorism offence is directed at those who supply the motivation
and imprimatur. This is particularly the case where the person advocating terrorism
holds significant influence over other people who sympathise with, and are prepared
to fight for, the terrorist cause.[67]

3.46 In relation to the availability of other offences, the Attorney-General advised
that where the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has sufficient evidence, the existing
offences of incitement or the urging violence offences would be pursued. However,
these offences require the AFP to prove that the person intended the crime or violence
to be committed. There will not always be sufficient evidence to meet this threshold
because ‘persons advocating terrorism can be very sophisticated about the precise
language they use, even though their overall message still has the impact of
encouraging others to engage in terrorist acts’. [68]

It is no longer the case that explicit statements (which would provide evidence to meet
the threshold of intention) are required to inspire others to take potentially devastating
action in Australia or overseas. The cumulative effect of more generalised statements
when made by a person in a position of influence and authority can still have the
impact of directly encouraging others to go overseas and fight or commit terrorist acts
domestically. This effect is compounded with the circulation of graphic violent
imagery (such as beheading videos) in the same online forums as the statements are
being made. The AFP therefore require tools (such as the new advocating terrorism
offence) to intervene earlier in the radicalisation process to prevent and disrupt further
engagement in terrorist activity. [69]

3.47 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee acknowledged these points but concluded that,
on balance, it would be appropriate to further clarify the meaning of ‘advocate’ to

assist people in ‘prospectively knowing the scope of their potential criminal liability’. [70]

The Bill was not amended in this respect.

3.48 A number of stakeholders to this Inquiry raised concerns about the advocating
terrorism offences. The Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law submitted that s 80.2C
directly infringes the right to freedom of speech as it ‘limits the capacity for individuals
to voice their views and opinions on terrorism and overseas conflicts’. It observed that
the offence goes beyond the concept of incitement by criminalising the ‘promotion’ of
terrorism and by requiring only that the person is ‘reckless’ as to whether their words
may result in terrorism (as opposed to intending that result).

The offence could apply, for example, to a person who posts online that they support
the beheadings of hostages by Islamic State. Such a comment would be highly
disagreeable, and it could legitimately attract the attention of the security services and
law enforcement to ensure that the person does not become involved in terrorism.
However, the law has not traditionally treated such actions as criminal acts unless the
person encourages another person to commit an unlawful act, and intends that the
unlawful act should be committed.[71]

3.49 The Gilbert and Tobin Centre stated that the broader approach adopted in the
offence of advocating terrorism is unjustified because of its significant impact on free
speech, and because it ‘may contribute to a sense of alienation and discrimination in
Australia’s Muslim communities if they feel like the government is not willing to have
an open discussion about issues surrounding terrorism and Islam’. [72]

3.50 The Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) questioned the need for the new
offence, in view of the offence in s 80.2 of the Criminal Code (criminalising ‘urging
violence’ against the Constitution or a Commonwealth, state or territory government)
and the offence of incitement, which covers urging another person to commit a terrorist
act.[73] They also questioned the assertion that the provision is proportionate.

The new advocacy offence is far wider in scope than the targeted offence of
incitement, requiring a person only to be reckless as to whether their expression of a
view ‘counsels, promotes, encourages or urges’ another to commit a terrorist act,
rather than intending them to do so.[74]

3.51 The Law Council of Australia (Law Council) observed that div 80 and s 80.2C
are framed broadly, and may have the ‘potential to unduly burden freedom of
expression’. The good faith defence ‘may not address concern of criminal liability
experienced by those engaged in publishing or reporting on matters that could
potentially fall within the broad scope of the offences’.[75]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 69

**_Prescribed terrorist organisations_**

3.52 Similar concerns about overreach have been identified in relation to prescribed
terrorist organisations under div 102 of the Criminal Code. These provisions allow an
organisation to be prescribed by regulations as a terrorist organisation where it is
directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing
of a terrorist act, or advocates the doing of a terrorist act.[76] Professor George Williams
has commented that, while it is understandable that the law would permit groups to be
banned that engage in or prepare for terrorism, ‘it is not justifiable to ban an entire
group merely because someone affiliated with it praises terrorism’.[77]

3.53 The Gilbert and Tobin Centre stated that, as a result, members of an organisation
may be exposed to serious criminal offences for expressing radical and controversial
(but not necessarily harmful) views about terrorism and religion.

An organisation may be proscribed on the basis of views expressed by some of its
members, which means that other individuals may be exposed to liability when they
do not even agree with those views. Indeed, an organisation may even be proscribed
on the basis that the views it expresses might encourage a person with a severe mental
illness to engage in terrorism.[78]

**_Using a postal service to menace, harass or cause offence_**

3.54 Another provision of the Criminal Code that received comment in submissions
was s 471.12, which provides that a person is guilty of an offence if the person uses a
postal or similar service in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being, in all
the circumstances, menacing, harassing or offensive. This provision was the subject of
the High Court’s deliberations in Monis v The Queen.[79]

3.55 The University of Melbourne Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies
submitted that s 471.12 unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech, and political
communication in particular for the following reasons:

- application to core political speech—the broad scope of the provision means that
it can operate to suppress core political speech; and

76 _Criminal Code (Cth) s 102.1. Related criminal offences include those in relation to being a member of,_
training with, or providing support or resources to a terrorist organisation: Ibid ss 102.3, 102.5, 102.7.
77 Williams, above n 34, 220.
78 Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law, Submission 22. Section 102.1(1A)(c) of the Criminal Code
provides that an organisation advocates the doing of a terrorist act if it ‘directly praises the doing of a
terrorist act in circumstances where there is a substantial risk that such praise might have the effect of
leading a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment that the person might suffer) to
engage in a terrorist act’. The notion of proscribing speech based upon a reaction of someone who suffers
from a mental impairment is ‘extraordinary’ and a ‘radical departure from the normal, accepted legal
standard of a “reasonable person”’: Williams, above n 34, 220.
79 _Monis v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 92._


-----

70 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

- the ‘offensiveness’ standard is not sufficient to justify a law that criminalises
political speech.[80]

3.56 The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies suggested that s 471.12
should include ‘clear exceptions for communication pertaining to matters that are in the
public interest in order to protect core political speech’ and that offensiveness should
not be used as a criterion of the offence, leaving only ‘menacing’ and ‘harassing’. [81]

Alternatively, the provision could specify matters that the court must consider when
determining whether the communication was offensive.[82]

**_Other criminal laws_**

3.57 Many other Criminal Code provisions potentially engage with freedom of
speech, including those creating offences in relation to providing false or misleading
information or documents;[83] distributing child pornography material; and counselling
the committing of suicide.[84]

**_Incitement and conspiracy laws_**

3.58 The concepts of incitement and conspiracy have a long history in the common
law. Traditional freedom of speech has never protected speech inciting the commission
of a crime.

3.59 Under s 11.4 of the Criminal Code (Cth) a person who urges the commission of
an offence is guilty of the offence of incitement. Incitement may relate to any offence
against a law of the Commonwealth and is not limited to serious offences, such as
those involving violence. Therefore, a person may commit the offence of incitement by
urging others to engage in peaceful protest by trespassing on prohibited
Commonwealth land.[85]

3.60 Similarly, a person who conspires with another person to commit an offence
punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units
or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence.[86]

3.61 The Law Council observed that various features of the terrorism offences in
div 101 of the Criminal Code—including the preparatory nature of some offences, and
the broad and ambiguously defined terms on which the offences are based, when
combined with the offence of incitement may ‘impact on freedom of speech more than

80 Cf Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) s 18C. Unlike s 471.12, s 18C does not create a criminal offence

is necessary to achieve the putative objective and is not specific enough to avoid
capturing less serious conduct’.[87]

#### Secrecy laws

3.62 The secrecy of government information has a long history. [88] The notion that the
activities of government should be secret goes back to a period when monarchs were
motivated by a desire to protect themselves against their rivals and official information
was considered the property of the Crown, to be disclosed or withheld at will. Two
principal rationales for secrecy in the modern context are the Westminster system of
government and the need to protect national security.[89]

3.63 The exposure of state secrets may be seen as falling outside the scope of
traditional freedom of speech. However, while the conventions of the Westminster
system were once seen to demand official secrecy, secrecy laws may need to be
reconsidered in light of principles of open government and accountability—and
modern conceptions of the right to freedom of speech.

3.64 Many Commonwealth laws contain provisions that impose secrecy or
confidentiality obligations on individuals or bodies in respect of Commonwealth
information. Statutory secrecy provisions typically exhibit four common elements:

- protection of particular kinds of information;

- regulation of particular persons;

- prohibition of certain kinds of activities in relation to the information; and

- exceptions and defences which set out the circumstances in which a person does
not infringe a secrecy provision.

3.65 In its 2009 report Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia (ALRC
Report 112), the ALRC identified 506 secrecy provisions in 176 pieces of primary and
subordinate legislation.[90]

3.66 Provisions in Commonwealth legislation that expressly impose criminal
sanctions for breach of secrecy or confidentiality obligations include, for example:

- _Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 70, 79;_

- _Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 (Cth) ss 191, 193S, 200A;_

- _Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth) ss 86-2, 86-5, 86-6, 86-7;_

- _Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth)_

- _Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) ss 18, 34ZS(1) and_
(2), 35P(1) and (2), 81, 92(1) and (1A).

3.67 Other provisions impose secrecy or confidentiality obligations but do not
expressly impose criminal sanctions. Such provisions create a ‘duty not to disclose’,
which may attract criminal sanctions under s 70 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). These
include, for example:

- _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) ss 189B,_
251(3), 324R, 341R, 390R;

- _Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 (Cth) s 87(4); and_

- _Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth) s 114._

3.68 The ALRC recommended, among other things, that the general secrecy offences
in ss 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act should be repealed and replaced by new offences that
require that the disclosure of Commonwealth information did, or was reasonably likely
to, or intended to cause harm.[91]

3.69 The ALRC concluded that specific secrecy offences are only warranted where
they are ‘necessary and proportionate to the protection of essential public interests of
sufficient importance to justify criminal sanctions’ and should include an express
requirement that the unauthorised disclosure caused, or was likely or intended to cause,
harm to an identified essential public interest.[92] These recommendations have not been
implemented.

3.70 PIAC endorsed, in the context of freedom of speech, the ALRC’s earlier
recommendations with regard to reform of secrecy offences and observed:

Blanket restrictions on the dissemination of information regarding government
activity should generally be viewed with a critical eye. Australia’s constitutionallymandated system of democratic, responsible government requires transparency and
openness and, as such, any such restrictions are only justifiable if they are tightly
defined and closely tied to a legitimate purpose.[93]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 73

**_Australian Border Force Act_**

3.71 The scope of secrecy and disclosure provisions enacted in the Australian Border
_Force Act 2015 (Cth) have been criticised by the Law Council because the provisions_
‘may discourage legitimate whistle-blowers from speaking out publicly’. [94]

3.72 Part 6 of the Australian Border Force Act makes it an offence to record or
disclose any information obtained by a person in their capacity as an entrusted person,
punishable by imprisonment for 2 years.[95] An ‘entrusted person’ is defined to include
the secretary, the Australian Border Force Commissioner and any Immigration and
Border Protection Department worker.[96] The latter category of person may, by written
determination of the secretary or Commission, include any consultant, contractor or
service provider—such as a doctor or welfare worker in an offshore immigration
detention centre.[97]

3.73 Sections 42–49 of the Act provide an extensive range of exceptions. In
summary, however, unauthorised disclosure is only permissible if it is ‘necessary to
prevent or lessen a serious threat to the life or health of an individual’ and the
disclosure is ‘for the purposes of preventing or lessening that threat’.[98]

3.74 The Law Council submitted that the relevant provisions of the Bill should be
amended to include a public interest disclosure exception; and that the secrecy offences
should include an express requirement that, for an offence to be committed, the
unauthorised disclosure caused, or was likely or intended to cause, harm to an
identified essential public interest.[99]

**_ASIO Act secrecy provisions_**

3.75 Particular secrecy provisions have been subject to criticism for interfering with
freedom of speech or expression including, for example, in the Australian Security
_Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) (ASIO Act), where secrecy offences have_
been extended to apply to the unauthorised disclosure of information relating to a
‘special intelligence operation’.[100]

3.76 Section 35P(1) of the ASIO Act provides that a person commits an offence if the
person discloses information; and the information relates to a ‘special intelligence

contractual or general law remedies: Australian Law Reform Commission, Secrecy Laws and Open

operation’.[101] Recklessness is the fault element in relation to whether the information
relates to a special intelligence operation.

3.77 Section 35P(2) provides an aggravated offence where the person intends to
endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a
special intelligence operation; or the disclosure of the information will endanger the
health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special
intelligence operation.

3.78 The Explanatory Memorandum stated that these offences are ‘necessary to
protect persons participating in a [special intelligence operation] and to ensure the
integrity of operations, by creating a deterrent to unauthorised disclosures, which may
place at risk the safety of participants or the effective conduct of the operation’. [102]

3.79 The Human Rights Committee examined provisions of the ASIO Act in its
consideration of the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014, and
concluded that these offence provisions had not been shown to be a reasonable,
necessary and proportionate limitation on the right to freedom of expression. [103] The
provisions were incompatible with the right to freedom of expression because they
appeared to impose disproportionate limits on that right.[104]

3.80 While the statement of compatibility highlighted the existence of defences and
safeguards, the Human Rights Committee observed that because s 35P(1) ‘applies to
conduct which is done recklessly rather than intentionally, a journalist could be found
guilty of an offence even though they did not intentionally disclose information about a

[special intelligence operation]’.[105]

As [special intelligence operations] can cover virtually all of ASIO’s activities, the
committee considers that these offences could discourage journalists from legitimate
reporting of ASIO’s activities for fear of falling foul of this offence provision. This
concern is compounded by the fact that, without a direct confirmation from ASIO, it
would be difficult for a journalist to accurately determine whether conduct by ASIO is
pursuant to a [special intelligence operation] or other intelligence gathering power.[106]

3.81 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee also considered these provisions and criticised
the broad drafting:

First, they are not limited to initial disclosures of information relating to a [special
intelligence operation] but cover all subsequent disclosures (even, it would seem, if
the information is in the public domain). In addition, these new offences as currently
drafted may apply to a wide range of people including whistleblowers and journalists.

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 75

Second, the primary offence (unlike the aggravated version) is not tied to the
underlying purposes of the criminalisation of disclosure. This means that the offence
(under subsection 35P(1)) could be committed even if unlawful conduct in no way
jeopardises the integrity of operations or operatives.[107]

3.82 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee added that its concerns were heightened by the
fact that the application of the offences depends on whether or not the information
relates to a special intelligence operation, which in turn depends on an authorisation
process which is internal to ASIO.[108]

3.83 The Attorney-General provided a detailed response to these concerns, restating
that the wrongdoing to which the offences are directed is the harm inherent in the
disclosure of highly sensitive intelligence-related information; and that the provisions
were ‘necessary and proportionate to the legitimate objective to which they are
directed’. For example:

- the offences need to be capable of covering information already in the public
domain because risks associated with disclosure of information about a special
intelligence operation (including its existence, methodology or participants) are
just as significant in relation to a subsequent disclosure as they are in relation to
an initial disclosure;

- the offences need to be capable of applying to all persons, consistent with
avoiding the significant risks arising from disclosure, and it would be contrary to
the criminal law policy of the Commonwealth to create specific exceptions for
journalists from legal obligations to which all other Australian persons and
bodies are subject; and

- the policy justification for adopting recklessness as the applicable fault element
is to place an onus on persons contemplating making a public disclosure to
consider whether or not their actions would be capable of justification to this
standard.[109]

3.84 Section 35P of the ASIO Act was enacted unchanged. [110] In December 2014, the
Prime Minister announced that the newly appointed Independent National Security
Legislation Monitor would review any impact on journalists of the provisions. [111]

76 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.85 Stakeholders in this ALRC Inquiry expressed concerns about the secrecy
provisions of the ASIO Act.[112] The Joint Media Organisations expressed a range of
concerns about s 35P, including that it

- criminalises journalists for undertaking and discharging their role in a modern
democratic society;

- does not include an exception for journalists and the media for public interest
reporting; and

- further erodes the already inadequate protections for whistle-blowing and has a
chilling effect on sources.[113]

3.86 Free TV Australia expressed concern that the offences remain capable of
capturing ‘the activities of journalists reporting in the public interest’. Section 35P, it
said, appears to capture circumstances where a person does not know whether the
relevant information relates to an intelligence operation; or knows that the information
relates to an intelligence operation but does not know it is a special intelligence
operation.[114] Free TV Australia wrote that problems with the provisions include that:

     - It is unclear whether [special intelligence operation] status can be conferred
retrospectively;

     - It appears to apply regardless of who the disclosure is made to, for example, if a
journalist discloses the material to his/her editor and the story is subsequently not
published, the offence provision may still apply;

     - If a number of disclosures are made in the course of preparing a story, it appears
to apply to all disclosures (for example, it could apply to the source, the journalist
and the editor, even if the story is not ultimately published);

     - It applies to whistle-blowers, further discouraging whistleblowing.[115]

3.87 The Law Council stated that s 35P may not include sufficient safeguards for
public interest disclosures, ‘suggesting a disproportionate infringement on freedom of
speech’.[116] The Human Rights Law Centre submitted that the offences in s 35P
‘disproportionately and unjustifiably limit freedom of speech and expression and
should be repealed’.[117]

114 Free TV Australia observed that the impact of s 35P may be ‘amplified in the context that information
relating to SIOs is unlikely to be readily identifiable as such’, so that journalists reporting on intelligence
and national security matters will not necessarily know whether or not information ‘relates to’ a special
intelligence operation or not: Free TV Australia, Submission 48.

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 77

3.88 PIAC observed that the ‘natural and ordinary meaning of the provision suggests
a broad scope: it could apply, for example, to a journalist publishing information in
circumstances where there may well be an overriding public interest to do so’. PIAC
recommended that s 35P be repealed.[118]

3.89 The UNSW Law Society stated that the lesser offence under s 35P(1)
‘unnecessarily restricts the freedom of communication’ because there is ‘no public
interest defence for unauthorised disclosure, which is likely to restrict legitimate
scrutiny of security agencies’,[119] and because there is no harm element.

The prosecution has to prove that the accused was reckless as to whether the
information related to a [special intelligence operation], and consequently a person
can face up to 5 years imprisonment for disclosure that does not endanger lives or
prejudice the [special intelligence operation].[120]

**_Other secrecy provisions_**

3.90 Other provisions identified as raising freedom of speech concerns included:

- _Criminal Code s 105.41, which provides for a range of offences in relation to_
disclosing that a person is in preventative detention; [121]

- _Criminal Code s 119.7, which prohibits the advertising or publishing of material_
which discloses the manner in which someone might be recruited to become a
foreign fighter;[122]

- _Crimes Act s 3ZZHA, which prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of_
information in relation to the application for or execution of a delayed
notification search warrant;[123] and

- _Crimes Act ss 15HK, 15HL, which prohibit the disclosure of information_
relating to a ‘controlled operation’.[124]

**_Public interest disclosure_**

3.91 The Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (Cth) is intended to encourage and
facilitate the making of public interest disclosures by public officials and, in some
circumstances, provides public officials with protection from liability under secrecy

disclosure (external or otherwise)—and therefore unjustifiably interfere with freedom
of speech’.[125]

#### Contempt laws

3.93 The law of contempt of court is a regime of substantive and procedural rules,
developed primarily within the common law, whereby persons who engage in conduct
tending to interfere with the administration of justice may be subjected to legal
sanctions.[126] These rules may be seen as interfering with freedom of speech.

3.94 In addition, s 195 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides that a person must
not, without the express permission of a court, print or publish any question that the
court has disallowed nor any question in respect of which the court has refused to give
leave under pt 3.7 (in relation to credibility). This is a strict liability offence.

3.95 A range of other legislative provisions protect the processes of tribunals,
commissions of inquiry and regulators. These laws interfere with freedom of speech
by, for example, making it an offence to use insulting language towards public officials
or to interrupt proceedings, and include:

- _Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) s 63;_

- _Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) s 264E;_

- _Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) s 173;_

- _Defence Act 1903 (Cth) s 89;_

- _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) s 119;_

- _Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) s 674;_

- _Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Act 2012_
(Cth) s 61;

- _Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 (Cth) s 94;_

- _Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth) s 6O; and_

- _Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) s 170._

3.96 Some of these same laws also make it an offence to use words that are false and
defamatory of a body or its members; or words calculated to bring a member into
disrepute.[127]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 79

3.97 The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies submitted that such laws
unjustifiably interfere with freedom of speech—and may in some cases be
unconstitutional—having regard to

- the content-based nature of the laws—that is, the laws regulate speech because
of the harm caused by the communication of a message rather than being
directed to the ‘time, place and manner’ in which speech occurs;

- the provisions directly target criticism of public officers engaged in performing
public functions, affecting ‘core political speech’; and where

- less restrictive means are available to achieve the ends pursued by these laws,
such as existing defamation law and powers to exclude individuals from
proceedings.[128]

3.98 The Human Rights Committee in its consideration of the Veterans’ Affairs
Legislation Amendment (Mental Health and Other Measures) Bill 2014 requested
further advice from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs as to the compatibility of s 170
with the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In particular, the Committee asked
whether the measure was rationally connected to its stated objective; and proportionate
to achieving that objective.[129]

3.99 The Minister responded that the provision was likely to be effective in achieving
the objective of protecting the Board and its hearings because it would act as a
deterrent to inappropriate and disruptive behaviour. As to the question of
proportionality, it was noted that, on occasion, the Board operates from non-secure,
non-government premises, and protections are required to ensure the safety and proper
function of the Board and its members.[130]

#### Anti-discrimination laws

3.100 Commonwealth anti-discrimination laws may interfere with freedom of speech
by making unlawful certain forms of discrimination, intimidation and harassment that
can be manifested in speech or other forms of expression. At the same time, such laws
may protect freedom of speech, by preventing a person from being victimised or
discriminated against by reason of expressing, for example, certain political or
religious views.

3.101 The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (RDA) makes unlawful offensive
behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. [131] The Sex

_Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) makes sexual harassment unlawful in a range of_
employment and other contexts.[132]

3.102 The Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth) and Disability Discrimination Act 1992
(Cth) make it an offence to advertise an intention to engage in unlawful age and
disability discrimination.[133] Each of these Acts also makes it an offence to victimise a
person because the person takes anti-discrimination action.[134]

3.103 More generally, these Acts, together with the Australian Human Rights
_Commission Act 1986 (Cth), prohibit breaches of human rights and discrimination on_
the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, social
origin, age, medical record, criminal record, marital status, impairment, disability,
nationality, sexual preference and trade union activity. The conduct prohibited may
include speech or other forms of expression.

3.104 Similarly, the general protections provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)
provide protection from workplace discrimination because of a person’s race, colour,
sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or
carer’s responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or
social origin.[135]

**_Racial Discrimination Act_**

3.105 There has been much debate over the scope of s 18C of the RDA. Section 18C
provides that it is unlawful to ‘do an act’, otherwise than in private, if:

(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or
intimidate another person or a group of people; and

(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other
person or of some or all of the people in the group.

3.106 Importantly, s 18C does not create a criminal offence. Under s 46P of the
_Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth), a person may make a complaint_
about an unlawful act to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Where the
complaint is not resolved, an application may be made to the Federal Court or the
Federal Circuit Court. If the court is satisfied that there has been unlawful
discrimination, the court may make orders, including for compensation. [136]

3.107 Section 18D provides exemptions. It states that s 18C does not render unlawful
anything said or done reasonably and in good faith for various purposes, including
artistic work and reporting on events or matters of public interest.[137]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 81

3.108 On 25 March 2014, the Attorney-General, Senator the Hon George Brandis QC,
announced that the Government proposed amending the RDA to repeal s 18C and
insert a new section prohibiting vilification and intimidation on the basis of race,
colour or national or ethnic origin.[138] This announcement followed controversy about
s 18C occasioned by the decision of Eatock v Bolt.[139] On 6 August 2014, after
consultation on an exposure draft Freedom of Speech (Repeal of s 18C) Bill, the Prime
Minister, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, announced that the proposed changes to s 18C had
been taken ‘off the table’.[140]

3.109 A number of submissions to this ALRC Inquiry presented views on whether
s 18C unjustifiably interferes with freedom of speech. Some stakeholders raised
concerns about the breadth of s 18C.[141]

3.110 Professor Patrick Parkinson AM observed that s 18C is broader in its terms than
art 20 of the ICCPR, which provides that any ‘advocacy of national, racial or religious
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be
prohibited by law’.[142] In his view, s 18C should be similarly confined and not extend to
matters likely only to offend.[143]

3.111 FamilyVoice Australia submitted that s 18C does not fall within the ‘justifiable
limitations of protecting personal reputation, national security, public order, public
health or public morals’ set out in the ICCPR and, therefore, constitutes an
unjustifiable limitation on freedom of speech.[144]

3.112 The Church and Nation Committee submitted that the state ‘cannot legislate
against offence and insult without doing serious damage to wide-ranging freedom of
speech’.[145] The Wilberforce Foundation stated that s 18C is flawed because it
‘essentially makes speech and acts unlawful as a result of a subjective response of
another or a group or others’. The flaw, it said, is compounded by s 18D, which does
not make truth a defence.[146]

3.113 Others submitted that the scope of the provision does strike an appropriate
balance between freedom of speech and other interests, including the right to be free

from racial discrimination,[147] or should be extended to other forms of speech.[148] For
example, the Law Society of NSW Young Lawyers (NSW Young Lawyers) submitted
that s 18C of the RDA, as it currently stands, ‘finely balances fair and accurate
reporting and fair comment with discrimination protections’.

The ‘reasonably likely’ test provided for in section 18C allows for an objective
assessment to be made, and ensures that the threshold for racial vilification is
appropriate. Section 18D of the RDA provides adequate safeguards to protect freedom
of speech by imposing a list of exemptions for ‘anything said or done reasonably and
in good faith’. The Australian Courts have historically interpreted sections 18C and
18D in a fair and reasonable manner, and with the public interest in mind.[149]

3.114 NSW Young Lawyers considered that, rather than going too far, s 18C only
limits freedom of speech to the extent required to ensure that communities are
protected from racial vilification:

Racial vilification can have a silencing effect on those who are vilified. In the absence
of a federal bill of rights and constitutional guarantees of human rights, the need to
strike a clear and equitable balance between the right to free speech and the right to be
free from vilification is obviously all the more pressing. Protection from racial
vilification is key to the protection that underpins our vibrant and free democracy, and
therefore its abolition cannot be seen as a reasonable or proportionate response to
‘restrictions’ on freedom of speech.[150]

3.115 PIAC stated that s 18C is an example of a justifiable limitation of free speech,
because the need to protect against harmful speech is clearly contemplated in
international law.[151] It observed that, in relation to racial vilification, ‘the law must
strike a balance between permitting the expression of views that might be disagreeable
or worse, but draw a line to prohibit speech that causes unreasonable harm to others’.
One of the key motivations for PIAC’s opposition to the proposed rollback of
restrictions on racist speech, in 2014, was said to be evidence of the wide-ranging
impact of racially motivated hate speech on PIAC’s clients.[152]

3.116 Jobwatch stated that s 18C should remain unchanged as it does not
‘unnecessarily restrict free speech, restrict fair comment or reporting of matters that are

_Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, opened for signature 21 December 1965, 660 UNTS_
195 (entered into force 4 January 1969). In this regard, art 4 is not fully implemented because it does not

in the public interest’.[153] The Law Council observed that, while there is a case for
amendment of the current provisions of the RDA ‘from a civil and political rights
perspective’, there is also ‘a strong view among a number of constituent bodies of the
Law Council that the balance was correctly struck in the existing legislation’. [154]

3.117 Australian racial vilification laws have long been the subject of academic and
other criticism. For example, in 2004, Dan Meagher found Commonwealth, state and
territory laws, including s 18C of the RDA, lacked ‘sufficient precision and clarity in
key respects’. He stated that, as a consequence, an incoherent body of case law has
developed, where too much is left open to the decision maker in each individual
case.[155]

3.118 Meagher concluded that the primary goal of racial vilification laws in
Australia—to regulate racial vilification without curbing legitimate public
communication—is compromised by this lack of precision and clarity.[156] In relation to
s 18C specifically, he wrote that the critical problem is that its key words and phrases
are ‘sufficiently imprecise in both their definition and application as to make the
putative legal standards they embody largely devoid of any core and ascertainable
content’.[157]

3.119 Meagher highlighted, in particular, that the meaning of the words ‘offend’ and
‘insult’ in s 18C of the RDA

is so open-ended as to make any practical assessment by judges and administrators as
to when conduct crosses this harm threshold little more than an intuitive and
necessarily subjective value judgement. The fact that an act must be ‘reasonably
likely’ to cross this harm threshold, though importing an objective test of liability,
does not cure the definitional indeterminacy of these words that a decision-maker
must objectively apply.[158]

3.120 More recently, Darryn Jensen has written that, under s18C, the reasonableness
requirement works to demand that the court make what is essentially a ‘political
decision’ about the boundaries of permissible speech. He highlights that, in contrast,
Tasmanian anti-vilification legislation avoids this particular problem by confining the
question to whether the speaker acted honestly in the pursuit of a permissible
purpose.[159]

3.121 Other common law countries have anti-vilification legislation. In New Zealand,
the Human Rights Act 1993 (NZ) makes it unlawful to use words in a public place
which are ‘threatening, abusive, or insulting’ and ‘likely to excite hostility against or

bring in contempt any group of persons … on the ground of the colour, race, or ethnic
or national origins of that group of persons’.[160]

3.122 In the United Kingdom, it is an offence for a person to ‘use threatening, abusive
or insulting words or behaviour’ if the person ‘intends thereby to stir up racial hatred’
or, having regard to all the circumstances, ‘racial hatred is likely to be stirred up
thereby’.[161]

3.123 The New Zealand and UK provisions seem narrower than the Australian
provision—leaving aside the operation of the exemptions in s 18D. For example, the
provisions do not cover offensiveness, and require that the person provoke hostility or
hatred against a group of persons defined by race or ethnicity.

3.124 Before 2013, the Canadian Human Rights Act 1985 (Can) prohibited the
sending of messages ‘likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt by
reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a
prohibited ground of discrimination’.[162]

3.125 The repeal of this provision, introduced by a private members’ bill and subjected
to a conscience vote,[163] was controversial.[164] Repeal was justified on a number of
grounds, including that the provision conflicted with the ‘freedom of thought, belief,
opinion and expression’ protected by s 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Human Rights
_and Freedom;[165]_ and because provisions of criminal law were considered to be the
‘best vehicle to prosecute these crimes’.[166]

#### Media, broadcasting and communications laws

3.126 Obscenity laws have a long history in the common law,[167] and censorship of
publications dates back to the invention of the printing press.[168]

3.127 In Australia, freedom of expression is subject to the restrictions of the

_Act 1995 (Cth) (Classification Act) and complementary state and territory enforcement_
legislation.[169]

3.128 Under the classification cooperative scheme some publications, films and
computer games may be classified as ‘RC’. In addition, s 9A of the Classification Act
provides that a publication, film or computer game that advocates the doing of a
terrorist act must be classified RC. The RC classification category is the highest
classification that can be given to media content in Australia. Such content is
effectively banned and may not be sold, screened, provided online or otherwise
distributed.

3.129 The Law Council observed that s 9A of the _Classification Act may_
‘inadvertently capture genuine political commentary and education materials, and stifle
robust public debate on terrorist-related issues’.[170]

3.130 The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) provides for restrictions on online
content. The Act sets out provisions in relation to internet content hosted outside
Australia, and in relation to content services, including some content available on the
internet and mobile services hosted in or provided from Australia.[171] Broadly, the
scheme places constraints on the types of online content that can be hosted or provided
by internet service providers and content service providers. This is expressed in terms
of ‘prohibited content’.[172]

3.131 Following the passage of the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015
(Cth), these provisions, and a new scheme addressed at cyber-bullying material, are to
be administered by the Children’s e-Safety Commissioner.

3.132 More generally, the Broadcasting Services Act regulates aspects of the
ownership and control of media in Australia, including through licensing. These rules
can also be characterised as interfering with freedom of expression.

3.133 Other communications laws place restrictions on freedom of speech and
expression. For example, the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth), Spam Act 2003
(Cth) and Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) all place restrictions on various forms of
telephone and online marketing. The Do Not Call Register Act prohibits the making of
unsolicited telemarketing calls and the sending of unsolicited marketing faxes to
numbers on the Register (subject to certain exceptions) and, to this extent, may limit
the rights of some people to impart information about commercial matters.

169 The Classification Act is supplemented by a number of regulations, determinations and other legislative
instruments, including the: National Classification Code (May 2005); Guidelines for the Classification of
Publications 2005 (Cth); Guidelines for the Classification of Films 2012 (Cth); and Guidelines for the
Classification of Computer Games 2012 (Cth).

172 Schedule 7 defines ‘prohibited’ or ‘potentially prohibited’ content: Ibid sch 7 cls 20, 21. Generally,
‘prohibited content’ is content that has been classified by the Classification Board as X 18+ or RC and, in
some cases, content classified R 18+ or MA 15+ where the content is not subject to a ‘restricted access
system’.

86 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.134 The Human Rights Committee considered the Do Not Call Register Act in its
examination of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer
Protection) Bill 2013. The Committee sought clarification from the Minister for
Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy as to whether the prohibitions
in the Act were compatible with the right to freedom of expression.[173]

3.135 The Minister responded that under art 19(3) of the ICCPR, restrictions on the
right to freedom of expression are permitted in limited circumstances, including to
secure or promote the rights of others (but only to the extent necessary and
proportionate). In this instance, the relevant right was the right to privacy protected by
art 17.[174] The Minister observed:

While telemarketing and fax marketing are legitimate methods by which businesses
can market their goods and services, the DNCR Act enables individuals to express a
preference not to be called by telemarketers or receive marketing faxes. Notably, the
DNCR Act does not prohibit the making of telemarketing calls, or the sending of
marketing faxes, to a number on the Register where the relevant account-holder or
their nominee has provided prior consent.[175]

3.136 Australian Lawyers for Human Rights submitted that s 313 of the
_Telecommunications Act unjustifiably limits freedom of speech.[176] This section_
imposes obligations on telecommunications carriers, carriage service providers and
carriage service intermediaries to do their best to prevent telecommunications networks
and facilities from being used in the commission of offences against the laws of the
Commonwealth or of the states and territories.

3.137 Commonwealth agencies have used s 313 to prevent the continuing operation of
online services in breach of Australian law (for example, sites seeking to perpetrate
financial fraud). The AFP uses s 313 to block websites which contain child sexual
abuse and exploitation material. Questions about how government agencies use this
provision to request the disruption of online services were the subject of a report, in
June 2015, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and
Communications.[177] The Committee recommended that the Australian Government
adopt whole-of-government guidelines for the use of s 313, proposed by the
Department of Communications.[178]

3.138 Australian Lawyers for Human Rights suggested that only services established
to be involved in serious crimes or that directly incite serious crimes should be covered
by s 313. They stated that ‘blocking has resulted in the disruption of thousands of

legitimate sites with completely legal content, to the commercial disadvantage and
inconvenience of the owners’. They went on to argue that s 313 should be redrafted ‘so
as to draw a proper balance between the potential infringement of human rights and
State interests’, and made subject to new accountability and oversight mechanisms.[179]

3.139 Finally, a number of stakeholders expressed concern about the
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015
(Cth)—including in relation to its implications for journalism and the protection of
media sources.[180] In March 2015, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access)
_Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 (Cth) was enacted, including some safeguards_
applying to the release of metadata that might identify a journalist’s source.

3.140 In some circumstances, Commonwealth information laws, including the Privacy
_Act 1988 (Cth) and Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act) may operate to_
interfere with freedom of speech and expression.

3.141 The Privacy Act regulates the handling of personal information about
individuals by most Australian Government agencies and some private sector
organisations, consistently with 13 Australian Privacy Principles. The application of
these principles may sometimes limit freedom of speech and expression, because
disclosure would breach privacy.

3.142 Free TV stated that the range of privacy-related laws and codes that apply across
Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions, and at common law, ‘collectively
operate to limit the ability of the media to report on matters’.[181]

3.143 While the objectives of the Freedom of Information Act include promoting
public access to information, the application of the exemptions may sometimes mean
that information cannot be released, potentially restricting freedom of speech. Freedom
of information has been recognised in international law as an ‘integral part’ of freedom
of expression.[182] For example, the ICCPR defines the right to freedom of expression as
including freedom to ‘seek’ and ‘receive’ information.[183]

3.144 Free TV identified aspects of the current FOI regime that may stifle ‘the media’s
ability to report on government information in a timely way’. In particular, they
identified

- routine delays past the 30 day time frame for decision making on FOI requests
from media organisations;

- agencies often advise journalists that an FOI request has been refused because of
s 24AA of the FOI Act, which provides that the work would involve a
substantial and unreasonable diversion of agency resources; and

- there is no direct right of appeal to the AAT except in the case of decisions made
by the Minister or the head of an agency.[184]

#### Intellectual property laws

3.145 Intellectual property laws, including the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), Trade Marks
_Act 1995 (Cth) and Designs Act 2003 (Cth) are intended to encourage creativity and_
innovation and protect businesses that develop original intellectual property by
providing limited monopoly privileges.[185]

3.146 While the history of intellectual property protection goes back to the 1710
_Statute of Anne, intellectual property rights can be seen as affecting others’ freedom of_
speech and expression.[186]

3.147 A number of stakeholders commented on the impact of copyright law on
freedom of expression. The Australian Digital Alliance and Australian Libraries
Copyright Committee (ADA and ALCC) observed a ‘fundamental tension’ between
copyright and free speech. The ADA and ALCC submitted that current copyright
exceptions unjustifiably interfere with freedom of speech and should be repealed and
replaced with a ‘fair use’ exception[187]—as recommended by the ALRC in its 2014
report Copyright and the Digital Economy.[188]

3.148 Other laws relating to intellectual property place restrictions on freedom of
speech and expression, including those relating to the use of national and other
symbols. In some cases, the use of certain words and symbols, such as defence
emblems and flags, is an offence:

- _Defence Act 1903 (Cth) s 83;_

- _Geneva Conventions Act 1957 (Cth);_

- _Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014 (Cth);_

- _Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 (Cth);_

- _Protected Symbols Determination 2013 (Cth); and_

- _Protection of the Word ‘ANZAC’ Regulations 1921 (Cth)._

3.149 The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 (Cth) and Tobacco Plain
_Packaging Act 2011 (Cth), prohibit the advertising of, and regulate the retail packaging_
and appearance of, tobacco products. The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) regulates
the advertising of therapeutic goods.[189]

3.150 In a response to a question from the Human Rights Committee, the Minister for
Health stated that, while the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Regulation
_2012 (Cth) ‘could be said to engage the right to freedom of expression as it regulates_
advertising content’, art 19(3) of the ICCPR expressly permits restricting this right
where necessary for protecting public health.[190]

3.151 The Human Rights Committee also considered the Major Sporting Events
(Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 2013 (Cth). The Major Sporting Events (Indicia
_and Images) Protection Act 2014 (Cth) provides special protection in relation to the use_
for commercial purposes of indicia and images connected with certain major sporting
events such as Cricket World Cup 2015 and the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth
Games. In its report on the Bill, the Committee stated that it

accepts that the limitation on freedom of expression is proposed in pursuit of the
legitimate objective of promoting or protecting the rights of others (being the right of
people to participate in the events in question and the protection of the intellectual
property of the event sponsors), and that the proposed restrictions are rationally
connected to that objective in seeking to protect the financial interests of event
sponsors and investors, and thereby the financial viability of such events.[191]

3.152 In relation to the proportionality of the restriction, the Human Rights Committee
noted that exemptions were provided for the purposes of criticism, review or the
provision of information.[192]

#### Other laws

3.153 Many other Commonwealth laws may be characterised as interfering with
freedom of speech and expression.

3.154 The Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) places restrictions on engaging
in secondary boycotts, including through activist campaigning. A secondary boycott—
where a party engages with others in order to hinder or prevent a business from dealing
with a third party—is prohibited by s 45D if the conduct would have the effect of
causing substantial loss or damage to the business of the third person.

3.155 The Charities Act 2014 (Cth) provides that a charity cannot promote or oppose a
political party or a candidate for political office.[193]

3.156 The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) regulates the printing and
publication of electoral advertisements and notices, requirements relating to how-tovote cards, and prohibits misleading or deceptive publications and canvassing near
polling booths.[194]

3.157 Many laws impose prohibitions on forms of false, deceptive or misleading
statements, including the Competition and Consumer Act (Cth) (Australian Consumer
Law)[195] and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).[196]

3.158 Other laws impose restrictions on the use of certain words or expressions in
various contexts. For example:

- _Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) s 129 (restrictions on political party_
names);

- _Business Names Registration Act 2011 (Cth) ss 27, 28 (restrictions on words that_
can be used in business names);

- _Banking Act 1959 (Cth) ss 66 and 66A (restrictions on the words ‘bank’,_
‘building society’, ‘credit union’ or ‘credit society’); and

- _Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ss 923A, 923B (restrictions on the use of the words_
‘independent’, ‘impartial’ or ‘unbiased’, ‘stockbroker’, ‘sharebroker’ and
‘insurance broker’).

## Justifications for encroachments

3.159 It is widely recognised that freedom of speech is not absolute. Even the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution has been held not to protect all speech: it
does not, for example, protect obscene publications or speech inciting imminent
lawless action.[197]

3.160 The difficulty is always balancing the respective rights or objectives. Barendt
stated that it ‘is difficult to draw a line between speech which might appropriately be
regulated and speech which in any liberal society should be tolerated’. [198]

3.161 Bills of rights allow for limits on most rights, but the limits must generally be
reasonable, prescribed by law, and ‘demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society’.[199]

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 91

3.162 Some of the principles and criteria that might be applied to help determine
whether a law that interferes with freedom of speech is justified, including those under
international law, are discussed below. However, it is beyond the practical scope of this
Inquiry to determine whether appropriate justification has been advanced for particular
laws.[200]

3.163 The literature on freedom of speech is extensive and there is considerable
disagreement about the appropriate scope of the freedom. Professor Adrienne Stone
observed that the ‘sheer complexity of the problems posed by a guarantee of freedom
of expression’ makes it unlikely that a single ‘theory’ or ‘set of values’ might be
appropriate in resolving ‘the entire range of freedom of expression problems’.[201]

3.164 In the United States, doctrine on the First Amendment is said to be characterised
by a categorical approach, according to which freedom of expression law is dominated
by relatively inflexible rules, each with application to a defined category of
circumstances.[202]

3.165 However, the dominant alternative approach is to use a proportionality test. As
discussed in Chapter 1, proportionality is the accepted test for justifying most
limitations on rights, and is used in relation to freedom of speech.

3.166 For example, the Human Rights Committee in its examination of legislation,
asks whether a limitation is aimed at achieving a legitimate objective; whether there is
a rational connection between the limitation and that objective; and whether the
limitation is proportionate to that objective. [203] A number of stakeholders expressly
endorsed proportionality as a means of assessing justifications for interferences with
freedom of speech.[204]

#### Legitimate objectives

3.167 Both the common law and international human rights law recognise that
freedom of speech can be restricted in order to pursue legitimate objectives such as the
protection of reputation and public safety. Many existing restrictions on freedom of
speech are a corollary of pursuing other important public or social needs, such as the
conduct of fair elections, the proper functioning of markets or the protection of
property rights.

92 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.168 In its consideration of legislation, the Human Rights Committee sometimes
simply asks whether a limitation of freedom of speech is aimed at achieving a
‘legitimate objective of promoting or protecting the rights of others’ [205]—a quite open
category of limitation. The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies agreed that
the ‘concept of a legitimate end should encompass a wide range of laws and that only
exceptionally would a law be considered not to pursue a legitimate end’.[206]

3.169 The power of Australian law-makers to enact provisions that restrict freedom of
speech is not necessarily constrained by the scope of permissible restrictions on
freedom of speech under international human rights law.[207] However, in considering
how restrictions on freedom of speech may be appropriately justified, one starting point
is international human rights law, and the restrictions permitted by the ICCPR.

3.170 The ICCPR states that the exercise of freedom of expression ‘carries with it
special duties and responsibilities’:

It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are
provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of
public health or morals.[208]

3.171 Many of the laws discussed above pursue these objectives. For example, many
of the criminal laws—and incitement offences—clearly protect the rights of others,
including the right not to be a victim of crime. Some criminal laws, such as counterterrorism laws, are concerned with the protection of national security or public order.

3.172 The Siracusa Principles define ‘public order’, as used in the ICCPR, as ‘the sum
of rules which ensure the functioning of society or the set of fundamental principles on
which society is founded’.[209]

3.173 Some secrecy laws prohibit the disclosure of information that has the potential
to damage national security—such as those in the ASIO Act—or public order. It may
be harder to justify secrecy offences where there is no express requirement that the
disclosure cause, or be likely to cause, a particular harm.[210] Arguably, public order is
not necessarily engaged where the objective of a secrecy offence is simply to ensure
the efficient conduct of government business or to enforce general duties of loyalty and
fidelity on employees.

_3. Freedom of Speech_ 93

3.174 On the other hand, some regulatory agencies, such as taxation, social security
and health agencies, and regulatory and oversight bodies such as corporate regulators,
need to strictly control disclosures of sensitive personal and commercial information
provided to them by the public. For these agencies, the harm caused by the
unauthorised disclosure of this information is not only harm to a person’s privacy or
commercial interests, but harm to the relationship of trust between the government and
individuals which is integral to an effective regulatory or taxation system, and the
provision of government services.[211] Avoiding this harm may more easily be seen as
implicating ‘public order’, in the sense used in the ICCPR.

3.175 To the extent that contempt laws may be characterised as limiting freedom of
speech, the laws may be justified as protecting the rights or reputations of others, and
public order, as protecting tribunal proceedings can be seen as essential to the proper
functioning of society. However, a limitation to a human right based upon the
reputation of others should not be used to ‘protect the state and its officials from public
opinion or criticism’.[212]

3.176 Restrictions on freedom of speech under anti-discrimination laws may also be
justified under the ICCPR as necessary to respect the rights or reputations of others,
including the right to effective protection against discrimination, as provided by art 26.

3.177 Laws to prevent or restrict dissemination of indecent or classified material, such
as the Classification Act, may be justified as protecting public health or morals. As
discussed above, limitations on unsolicited telemarketing calls contained in the Do Not
_Call Register Act have been justified as protecting privacy; and tobacco advertising_
prohibitions as protecting public health.

3.178 There remain other laws restricting freedom of speech and expression that do
not as obviously fall within the permissible restrictions referred to in art 19 of the
ICCPR.

#### Proportionality and freedom of speech

3.179 Whether all of the laws identified above as potentially interfering with freedom
of speech in fact pursue legitimate objectives of sufficient importance to warrant
restricting speech may be contested. However, even if a law does pursue such an
objective, it will be important to also consider whether the law is suitable, necessary
and proportionate.

3.180 In relation to justifications for limiting freedom of expression, the UN Human
Rights Committee has stated:

When a State party invokes a legitimate ground for restriction of freedom of
expression, it must demonstrate in specific and individualized fashion the precise
nature of the threat, and the necessity and proportionality of the specific action taken,

Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1985/4, Annex
(1985) cl 37.


-----

94 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

in particular by establishing a direct and immediate connection between the
expression and the threat.[213]

3.181 The UN Human Rights Committee has also observed that the principle of
proportionality must take account of the ‘form of expression at issue as well as the
means of its dissemination’. For instance, the value placed on ‘uninhibited expression
is particularly high in the circumstances of public debate in a democratic society
concerning figures in the public and political domain’.[214] This is consistent with the
additional protection afforded under Australian common law to political
communication.

3.182 The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies submitted that in applying
the principles of proportionality to limitations on freedom of speech, regard should be
had to the following:

     - whether the law interfering with freedom of speech is ‘content-neutral’ or
‘content-based’;

     - the extent to which the law interferes with freedom of speech including the
availability of alternative, less restrictive means; and

    - the nature of the affected speech.[215]

3.183 In relation to the first of these criteria, a content-based law aims to address
harms caused by the content of the message communicated. Defamation laws, hate
speech laws, laws regulating obscenity or pornography, and laws directed at sedition
were given as examples of content-based laws.

3.184 In contrast, a content-neutral law is directed towards some other purpose
unrelated to the content of expression. Laws directed to the ‘time, place and manner’ in
which speech occurs such as laws that regulate protest—by requiring that protest be
limited to certain places or times—laws that impose noise controls, or a law that limits
the distribution of leaflets directed at preventing litter were given as examples of
content-neutral laws.[216]

3.185 The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies submitted that content-based
laws should, ‘as a general matter, be considered more difficult to justify than contentneutral laws’.[217] The Centre also submitted that, as a general matter, the more extensive
the limitation on speech, the more significant the justification for that limitation must
be. Therefore extensive or ‘blanket’ bans on speech in a particular context or of a
particular kind, will be more difficult to justify than laws that apply in only some
circumstances or in some places. Further, some speech should be regarded as
especially valuable. In particular, speech about political matters, in various forms, was

said to require a higher level of protection, and laws that operate to interfere with
political speech should require special justification.[218]

## Conclusions

3.186 Legislation prohibits, or renders unlawful, speech or expression in many
different contexts. However, some of these provisions relate to limitations that have
long been recognised by the common law itself, such as obscenity and sedition.

3.187 Numerous Commonwealth laws may be seen as interfering with freedom of
speech and expression. There are, for example, more than 500 government secrecy
provisions alone.[219]

3.188 In the area of commercial and corporate regulation, a range of intellectual
property, media, broadcasting and telecommunications laws restrict the content of
publications, broadcasts, advertising and other media products. In workplace relations
context, anti-discrimination law, including the general protections provisions of the
_Fair Work Act, prohibit certain forms of speech and expression._

3.189 Some areas of particular concern, as evidenced by parliamentary committee
materials and other commentary, are:

- various counter-terrorism offences provided under the Criminal Code and, in
particular, the offence of advocating terrorism;

- various terrorism-related secrecy offences in the Criminal Code, Crimes Act and
ASIO Act and, in particular, that relating to ‘special intelligence operations’;
and

- anti-discrimination laws and, in particular, s 18C of the RDA.

3.190 Aspects of Australia’s counter-terrorism laws might be reviewed to ensure that
the laws do not unjustifiably interfere with freedom of speech.[220] Such a task would fall
within the role of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM),
who reviews the operation, effectiveness and implications of Australia’s counterterrorism and national security legislation on an ongoing basis. This role includes
considering whether the laws contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the rights of
individuals, remain proportionate to any threat of terrorism or threat to national
security or both, and remain necessary.[221] The Acting INSLM, the Hon Roger Gyles
AO QC, announced on 30 March 2015 that his first priority was to ‘review any impact
on journalists’ of the operation of s 35P of the ASIO Act. The review of s 35P is now
current.[222]

219 See Australian Law Reform Commission, Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia, Report No
112 (2009).
220 Aspects of these laws can also be considered as interfering with freedom of movement or freedom of
association, discussed in Chs 5–6.

222 See Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, above n 112.

96 _Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws_

3.191 Anti-discrimination law may also benefit from more thorough review in relation
to implications for freedom of speech. In particular, s 18C of the RDA has been the
subject of considerable recent controversy. Concerns about the operation of antidiscrimination law in relation to freedom of religion[223] may also raise related freedom
of speech issues.

3.192 There may also be reason to review the range of legislative provisions that
protect the processes of tribunals, commissions of inquiry and regulators. As discussed
above, these laws may unjustifiably interfere with freedom of speech—and may be
unconstitutional—in prohibiting criticism of public officers engaged in performing
public functions.

3.193 Finally, the Australian Government should give further consideration to the
recommendations of the ALRC in its 2009 report on secrecy laws.[224] In particular, the
ALRC recommended that ss 70 and 79(3) of the Crimes Act should be repealed and
replaced by new offences in the Criminal Code.[225] For example, s 70 might be replaced
with a new offence requiring that the disclosure of Commonwealth information did, or
was reasonably likely to, or intended to:

- damage the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth;

- prejudice the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of
criminal offences;

- endanger the life or physical safety of any person; or

- prejudice the protection of public safety.[226]
