I am contacting you because I am very concerned about the proposed Misinformation and
Disinformation bill. I understand that regulation is necessary and that hate speech can be
very dangerous. However, by generalising and preventing people or groups at one's own
discretion from speaking their mind on social media is in my view a governmental overreach.
How will there be freedom of speech or open discussions about topics if the government and
large traditional media outlets hold the key to who is allowed to post and who isn't? There
has been a dangerous tendency of preventing Christians from sharing their values. I am a
Christian, but not a right-wing extremist. We seem to be always thrown into that same pot
lately. People of faith should be able to share their faith online, as long as it doesn't affect
people with opposing views. I am of the opinion that freedom of speech is the backbone of a
democratic society, and this bill has the power to break that backbone. Please take my
thoughts into consideration.

Yours sincerely,

**Ulli Austermann**
