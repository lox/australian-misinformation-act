Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I strongly reject this proposed legislation. The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”.
But the government will cause harm by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the
rights of the individual, not suppressing them.

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” should cause grave concerns
about this bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from
getting and spreading the virus. Those who questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media. Yet it soon
became obvious to everyone the government was wrong, and the “misinformation” was right! Nearly every Australian
was vaccinated for Covid-19, yet the virus kept spreading until almost every Australian caught it!

The rationale for censorship on this issue might have been well-intentioned. But time proved the censor-happy
bureaucrats wrong.

This one example shows why giving the government even more power is a recipe for disaster.

This bill must be thrown out.
