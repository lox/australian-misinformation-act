Hello,

I have serious concerns about this Bill.

I am concerned that this Bill allows the situation where it will be the Government that determines the definition of
misinformation and disinformation, i.e., what is false, misleading, or deceptive, and by implication, what is true.

I am very concerned that our Australian government wants to be the arbiter of truth, rather than allowing freedom
of speech for all Australian citizens. This freedom of speech is a fundamental feature of our democracy.

The Bill conflicts with Article 19 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, where "everyone has the right to freedom
of opinion and expression.....and to seek, receive and impart ideas through any media".

The high penalties for online service providers for failure to comply will lead to excessive censorship and this
should be of great concern to Australian citizens.

Given the current climate of ideologically-based opinions of what is right or true, this Bill is a real threat to
freedom of speech and expression, and will likely shut down healthy and respectful debate.

Sincerely,

Robyn Murray

Public submission.
