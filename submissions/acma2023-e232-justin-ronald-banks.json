      "The legislation is not transparent, and the public is largely unaware of its implications.",
      "The bill could lead to fines for expressing opinions that deviate from the government's narrative.",
      "Truth should be determined through open debate and evidence, not dictated by a single entity."

      "Importance of public awareness and debate"
    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The notion that 'truth' can be molded to suit an agenda is abhorrent and fundamentally contradicts the principles of democracy, freedom of speech, the pursuit of knowledge and basic human rights.",
      "If you pass this bill and relegate what is 'truth' to solely come from ACMA or any other sole entity, this is what you take away from the Australian people; our ability to seek the truth."
