### Dear Sir,

 As a citizen of Australia, I am writing to strongly oppose the “sledge hammer” like Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 Firstly, your allegations /assumptions to justify why these additional powers are needed are dubious, very weak and not substantiated. In addition, the actual severity associated with the claimed harms is very vague and poorly documented.

 Please Refer to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023— Fact sheet

 The document claims “Misinformation and disinformation spread via digital platform services is a major issue worldwide. The rapid spread of false, misleading and deceptive information online has resulted in a multitude of harms from disrupted public health responses to foreign interference in elections and the undermining of democratic institutions.”

**One could easily argue true and accurate information that reflects the incompetency,**
**deceit or poor decision making of Governments worldwide is a clearly a major issue**
**(ie problem) for politicians but in fact is NOT a real issue to truth seekers and honest**
**citizens who want and expect responsible and honest Government.**

**For example,**

1) The Iraq War 2003. The USA claimed presence of weapons of mass destruction and

programs to develop such weapons supposedly, posed a "threat to the national
security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf
region and was the basis for a war that killed over 290,000 people, yet to this day
these claimed weapons were never found. Where is the investigation?

2) The current persecution, imprisonment and solitary confinement of courageous

people like Pastor Arthur Pawlowski by the Canadian Government is frightening
based on trumped up charges. The pastor is facing 10 years in prison after a
speech he gave at a trucker blockade. He has been targeted by the Canadian
Government because he simply spoke against the Tyranny he perceived was
occurring.

### Now let’s have a very honest look at these alleged HARMS from alleged misinformation.

 Claimed Harm 1 - Disrupted public health responses 

 Where is the evidence to suggest an alleged disruption to the health care responses occurred in Australia over the last 3-5 years, given the Australian and State Governments used tyrannical measures (and a multi million dollar pro vax advertising campaign) to coerce approx 90% of the population to be vaxxed with an experimental gene therapy based on the Government Health care agency claims (now actually false) that the Covid vaccinations were 100% safe and effective at both preventing infection and stopping the spread of Covid 19 throughout the community. 

 What disruption occurred and what was the extent and cost of this claimed disruption to public health and the cost to the community? I would love to know. Let’s see some proper data and analysis before your Department make these poorly justified claims. 

 The truth is the Covid vaccinations were not effective at stopping the spread of Covid 19 virus across Australia and did not create antibodies that prevented Covid symptoms in some cases leading to deaths. See referenced article from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. This article is 12 months old, so I expect infection rates are now well over 50% for all 3 States below.

 Almost one in every two Australians has had COVID-19

 https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/almost-one-in-every-two- australians-has-had-covid

 Noted - Signs of previous covid infection after vaccination were highest in NSW (49.8%), followed by Queensland (48.9%), then Victoria (46.5%). 

 So the embarrassing truth for the Federal Government is, that despite expenditure of approximately $8 billion on a highly rushed VAX program incl a massive MSM propaganda campaign using our taxes, approx 11.5 million Australians were infected and did suffer illness from covid 19 infections, with THOUSANDS now still suffering from long Covid.

 The sad reality is - the expensive Covid 19 vaccination program failed Australians. In addition, at least 1,000 Australians were reported to Australia’s

### TGA as dying within 16 weeks after the double vaccination, yet were not properly assessed by the TGA, with 98% of deaths being assessed as unrelated to the experimental vaccination. We are also now seeing increases in cancer amongst young people following vaccination as reported by the EPOCH Times on 28 July 2023.

 Please do some reading on Dr Melissa McCann’s research on this issue and presentation on Monday 13 Feb 2023 at Sydney’s ICC. Refer UAP website.  To date over 4.09 million people in NSW have been infected with Covid in NSW despite a Total Vaccine Dosage within NSW of 21.2 million up to 27 July 2023.

 The fact is ACMA as an organisation do not have the expertise or medical or scientific knowledge to assess Truth and neither do Social Media organisations when science and knowledge moves exponentially faster every year.

 The reality is the Australian Government already effectively censored anyone who even questioned the VAX program via social media including myself.  Facebook banned me posting at least twice over 12 months and prevented me posting anything. So any alleged disruption to the Government’s COVID agenda, could in fact, be assessed as false and mis-information because recent FIFO requests prove the Australian Government actually worked with Facebook to censor genuine concerns. Happy to provide evidence, if requested.

 Refer also the Weekend Australia 29 July 2023 – “COVID COVER-UP. How Science was silenced.”

 Claimed Harm 2 - Foreign interference in elections and the undermining of democratic institutions.”

 There have been multiple allegations made by the US Democratic party that have been Russian interference in both the 2016 and the 2020 US elections that supposedly favoured Donald Trump. There has in fact been very little solid evidence that this actually took place and yet the lie has been repeated endlessly by Democrat party friendly MSM and the Democratic party members themselves.

 A repeated lie by the Main Stream media (MSM) does not equate to truth. 

 So this claimed harm by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts is far from being supported by


-----

### accurate data, an accurate & defendable assessment of the level of supposed interference (was it 1,2,3,4 or 5 seats affected), the interference methodology, and exactly how the so called interference changed or affected an election result. In summary, this claim is far from proven or measurable, so should be treated with distain. 

 If foreign interference is in fact occurring in Australian Elections then that surely is a job for the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). 

 The ASD is a vital member of Australia’s national security community. It works across the full spectrum of operations required of contemporary signals intelligence and security agencies. This includes intelligence, cyber security and offensive cyber operations in support of the Australian Government and Australian Defence Force (ADF).

 It is not an ACMA core responsibility to carry out blanket censorship when there may in fact be only 10-15 Foreign (Russian and Chinese operatives or others) engaged in this practice and potentially data coming into Australia from offshore. In addition, ACMA neither has the skills or the available technology to investigate properly the source, the verasity and nature of this type of foreign interference. 

 Potential interference and bribery of Australian Election Candidates, current Australian politicians including Premiers, Private meetings by State Premiers with CCP (Chinese Government) officials, dodgy Preselection Processes, Branch stacking, Vote tampering, Interference/ Bribery of personnel and managers within the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) or VEC may in fact have absolutely nothing to do with supposed misinformation or disinformation presented or discussed in social media. Interference in Federal, State and Local Government Elections and associated processes can potentially cover a multitude of avenues outside Facebook, Twitter and Telegram.

 If a program of high impact Restriction and Censoring of 25 million Australians social media accounts by ACMA because Australians may wish to raise accurate and genuine concerns about the current Government and /or election processes on social media then this would be a massive and horrendous over–reach. In fact, it’s a direct attack on fair and open discussion and core democratic values.

# Secondly lets now discuss the level of censorship that already is fully operational in Australia and I’ll use the example of high

# EXCESS death rate data that sadly is sparsely reported in the MSM and when it is assessed as either Covid related or caused from reasons unknown. 

### Australia has had over 30,000 excess deaths from the start of 2022 to end April 2023. This is the equivalent of a fully laden 747 crashing every week.  
 I believe this should be the number one issue in Australia today, but the media remain silent, and this includes from the ABC and SBS, who supposedly are in existence to serve the Australian public and provide accurate and honest reporting.
 The only reason I can see for the media’s silence is that the most likely cause of this unprecedented and ongoing level of excess deaths was the panicked mass society-wide injection by the Australian Government of a novel & experimental genetic substance which hadn’t undergo any carcinogenic testing and significantly had zero long term safety data.  Meaning the Pfizer and Moderna Vaccination program has caused potentially caused major health related illnesses and organ damage that were never tested for mass vaccination. 
 Given that the powerful Australian Media, Labor & Liberal Governments were the cheer-squads for mandating this substance to be injected into all Australians, they now can’t bring themselves to even consider it may be the cause of the shocking & unprecedented level of excess deaths and major ongoing adverse effects that all too many Australians now suffer. 
 So the media (fully complicit in this tragedy) continues to bury its head in the sand and refuses to report on it, as do thousands of General Practitioners who fear APHRA’s ability to de register them, if they publicly express and/or discuss their concerns. Those who do have hell to pay. Note the case of Dr William Bay and others who can no longer practice. 
 This is certainly not an Australia only issue.  Dr John Campbell full video is linked here https://youtube.com/watch?v=4ZB0UziOOY8&t=619s John highlights the escalated high level of heart, liver and respiratory disease that has and is occurred across the UK and Europe that the associated Governments are simply ignoring.

 It’s absolutely no surprise to me that a Royal Commission (originally supported by PM Albanese) into how Australia managed the Covid disease has been

### voted down recently in the Australian Government Senate. So $8 billion of taxpayers money on a COVID prevention Program has been spent and essentially there is zero accountability on it’s how we went, it’s effectiveness, it’s protection benefits, and how we as a nation can do better next time. 

 Clearly nothing to see here??

# In short, at least on this critical issue Government Censorship already exists to an oppressive level within Australia and thus the justification for further control and censorship is non existent and deeply concerning. 

 I am sure there are other issues that are censored such as processes and contracts for purchase of billion dollar Defence assets incl diesel power French submarines that will never ever be properly and independently reviewed.

 Thirdly, now the main concerns I have with this proposed legislation that obviously has a clear aim to destroy or restrict free speech, are as follows.

  - The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and

## communication under International human rights instruments such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

  - The Bill is a significant overreach by the Government.

  - Why is the Government (and paid MSM) exempt from the scope of

## this Bill and thus un-accountable from spreading mis-information while the average Australia in contrast who very limited financial resources and zero power able to be fully censored for their beliefs and ideas. (which may prove to be correct and not false). 


-----

- The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats

## to silence speech in the public square without transparency or accountability or detailed subject knowledge on medical, immunology and REAL science. As discussed above this is already happening with very limited accountability.



- The Bill includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which


## risks it being weaponised to shut down legitimate speech on pressing social issues. As discussed above the claimed level of harm is poorly defined and vague. Each individual has an individual responsibility to check and assess what they read, without high levels of ACMA censorship that aligns with current Government policy, that may in fact not serve the people whom they supposedly represent.

- In most cases current Fact Checkers are simply employees of

## Media Organisations. They are ill equipped to assess facts and determine the truthfulness and accuracy of information. Eg AAP. Reuters

- The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service

## providers liable for excessive and onerous policing of legitimate speech.

- The exclusion of government-authorised content (incl Government

## paid MSM misinformation) from this censorship regime is hypocritical and inconsistent and will establish an asymmetry that results in one rule for government and another rule for Australians in what they can say.

- The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and

## private users of digital platforms to provide information and


-----

## evidence about misinformation and disinformation that is a worrying breach of privacy.

- The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and


## oversight for misuse of censorship powers.



  - The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the

## competing right to freedom of expression are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for the interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.

  - The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the

## misinformation codes and standards and for failing to provide evidence requested by ACMA are excessive and will provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech. 

  - It is highly likely under this Bill, Social Media companies will simply

## ban all comments that are not in alignment with Government policy even if they are 100% true and thus are in fact neither MIS or DIS INFORMATION.

### In summary, I and millions of freedom loving Australians strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 There is insufficient justification for it’s introduction, there is ZERO MANDATE from the Australian public to support it and the Bill has MAJOR PROBLEMS.

#### The Bill is an attack on freedom of speech that is inconsistent with Australia’s international human rights obligations and is out of step with equivalent European laws. The Bill enables government bureaucrats and big tech to silence and censor speech that goes far beyond reasonable limitation.


-----

#### The Bill will give the Australian government the power to silence religious and political speech that contradicts prevailing ideologies and political messaging including LGBTI and Gender Fluidity agendas. 

 In addition, the Bill fails to include mechanisms to protect valid expression of opinion and beliefs or to ensure that there are clear and defined limits on suppression of speech.

 Yours sincerely,
