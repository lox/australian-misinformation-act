      "The legislation could lead to silent censorship and suppression of free speech.",

    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "If the progress of science itself testifies how today's fact can turn into tomorrow's error (and vice versa), then government-inspired attempts at censorship in the end amount to a fool's errand at best and a cynical exercise in creeping authoritarianism at worst.",
      "The best (or least-worst) means we have to filter mid- and dis- information is still the freedom of speech, with all its messiness and occasional nastiness.",
      "This bill must be soundly defeated, preferably withdrawn."
