Dear Sir,

**Re: Anti-Free Speech Bill**

I have deep concern over the Anti-Free Speech Bill a.k.a. the Communications Legislation
**Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This would rival “The**
_Voice” as the worst thing Labor has tried to do thus far._

There are a number of issues that are quite contentious that could fall into disinformation and
misinformation, but which one gets you into trouble? There are some hot topics that some people
may corruptly seek to suppress debate on for political reasons not because they “pose a threat to
_the safety and wellbeing of Australians”._

There are many Australians who can think for themselves and don’t need to government to save
them from being exposed to dangerous ideas. Here is a short list of issues:

  - **Climate Change – Caused by human CO2 emissions v. Natural Milankovitch Cycles?**

  - **Drought, fire and floods – caused by Climate Change v. Caused by a failure to do hazard**
reduction burns and natural La Nina and El Nino cycles?

  - **Renewable energy – Clean, green energy and the saviour of humanity v. Unreliable,**
intermittent power source that can’t power an economy with more embodied energy then
they are ever likely to generate and a massive toxic waste problem at the end of their short
useful lives?

  - **Covid-19 origins – Leak from Chinese bioweapons lab v. Naturally occurred in a Chinese wet**
market?

  - **Efficacy of the Covid vaccine – Prevent you getting and spreading the virus v. not effective?**

  - **Efficacy of Ivermectin in treatment and prevention of severe Covid 19 infections – The TGA**
knows what is good for you v. Efficacy of Ivermectin being strongly backed in peer reviewed
medical literature?

  - **500 unexplained deaths per week in Australia – Nothing to see here v. Vaccine adverse**
events. v. Something else?

  - **COVID-19 vaccine adverse events – Vaccine adverse events running at 1 in 800 v. Safe and**
effective?

  - **Vaccine mandates, lockdowns and mask mandates – Good public health policy. v. They did**
more harm than good.


-----

  - **World Health Organisation response to Covid 19 – Hopelessly ineffective v. Corrupt and**
dangerously ineffective?

  - **Iraq War – Saving the world from Weapons of Mass Destruction. v. Profit opportunity by the**
military industrial complex?

  - **Affirmation only transgender treatments – Saving lives and bringing happiness to troubled**
young people. v. 90% of people will grow out of gender dysphoria by their early 20’s. v.
Poorly understood medical practice with massive complication and misdiagnosis rates?

  - **National School Curriculum – A great opportunity to indoctrinate children with Radical**
Gender Theory, Critical Race Theory, the Climate Change hoax, and socialism. v. Just stick to
the basics of literacy, numeracy and science?

  - **Australian elections – Free and fair, untainted by rigging v. There is considerable mismatch**
between the electoral rolls and Medicare records suggesting the Union whistle blowers who
spoke about voting many times using lists of names supplied by the Union were telling the
truth?

  - **UFO’s – Ridiculous conspiracy theory. v. Alien spacecraft. v. Experimental military aircraft. v.**
Just see an optometrist?

  - **Flat Earth theory – Disproved hundreds of years ago. v. The Quran says it is flat and is the**
true word of God. Try prosecuting this disinformation!

  - **JFK assassin – Lone gunman who fired a “magic bullet”. v. CIA plot?**

Every one of these issues has passionate supporters on both side. Free speech is a most basic
human right and a pillar of a democratic society.

You must also consider what some future government might do with this legislation, not just the
mischief this government wants to get up to. What if the official narrative is some organisation you
support is a terrorist organisation. You then face huge fines or jail for disagreeing.

You silence opposition and “disinformation” on one platform and people will just seek out the
information on other platforms in places the Australian Government can’t reach. Want to block
these sites? Just use a VPN or TOR. It will be like a game of “wack-a-mole” until the moles pop up
on the dark web or in jurisdictions out of your reach. For example, the Neo-Nazi web site “The Daily
_Stormer” is freely available on the Dark Web and raises money using the privacy focused crypto_
currency Monaro.

Mark Ellis
