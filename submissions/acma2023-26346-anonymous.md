I believe it is widely known there is a great deal of content online that is not true or has been
embellished of the truth somewhat.

Online content is no different to published content in books. The only difference is the accessibility
of the content.

**This bill is tantamount to ‘book burning’ in previous periods of our global history.**

Religion for some could be construed as "disinformation”.

Modern medicine could be classed as “disinformation” as some treatments do not work and give
false hope.

Weight loss programs could fall under the topic of “disinformation”.

**The most insidious and damaging disinformation is political diatribe that we are exposed to**
**constantly, year after year. We are lied to constantly; with promises never fulfilled from election**
**day!**

I could continue with many day-to-day examples of information that could be grouped under the
label of “disinformation”.

Whom deems what is information and what is “disinformation”? (The nazis? The Jews? The Labor
Party? The Liberal Party? The Greens?)

I do not agree with this bill in any capacity. I have the intelligence to research information I am
reading and base my beliefs and decisions upon this. If people are gullible and do not follow though
with further education, then that is a choice they make.

This bill needs to be renamed THE CENSORSHIP BILL of COMMUNIST AUSTRALIA. A shameful state
for what used to be the greatest country on earth.

This bill is totally unnecessary and NEFARIOUS!

I do not support this or any political party that supports and upholds this kind of legislation.
