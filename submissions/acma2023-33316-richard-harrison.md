To whom it may concern,

The proposal of the Albanese Government to pass a Disinformation/Misinformation bill is the worst
example of Government overreach I have ever seen. The bill itself contains, in my opinion,
disinformation and misinformation because it fails to even define these terms.

The reason for that is doubtless that they are unable to do so in a way which does not expose the
ludicrous nature of this proposed legislation.

Any person involved in the drafting of this legislation is either entirely ignorant or unbelievably
malevolent. Either way, they should be fired and never again allowed to hold any type of
Government job.

Freedom of speech is the foundation of our entire society. It is the bedrock which has allowed for
both a stable and law governed democracy as well as technological and scientific advancement.

Allowing a government to restrict what opinions can be aired in a free society is a prerequisite to
setting up a totalitarian dictatorship. If I had to make a distinction between First World and Third
World, this would be it.

For an example of the dangers of allowing Government to control opinions, one need look no further
than the Covid response. Doctors and scientists were fired for disagreeing with the Government
narrative.

We now know that Covid 19 fatality rates were in line with a bad case of influenza. That average age
of death from Covid was around 80 years old, that PCR tests were wildly unreliable with huge
numbers of false positives, that people were claimed to have died from Covid when in fact they
simply died with Covid.

We also know that Covid vaccines were neither safe, nor were they effective. At the time, however,
the Government were claiming that they were 96% effective and entirely safe. Even Kerryn Phelps,
the former President of the Australian Medical Association and her wife were badly injured by the
vaccine. Queensland closed its borders and kept everyone out until they reached around 97%
vaccination rates. Once that happened, only vaccinated people were allowed in.

Despite this, Covid went through the population like wildfire despite this supposedly “safe” vaccine
that the Government paid an undisclosed sum for.

Meanwhile, anyone raising questions was accused of “misinformation and disinformation.” That
included me. I was deprived of a $500 per week income stream from Google because they claimed I
was spreading “misinformation and disinformation” when, in fact, I was telling the truth. Even now,
despite this coming to light I am still not being paid. I have lost tens of thousands of dollars but I will
not buckle because the truth is central to my existence.

The idea that the Government can determine what truth is should send a chill down the spine of
anyone with a functioning brain.

1984 by George Orwell was a novel. It was, however, based on his understanding of modern
totalitarian societies such as Soviet Russia and Communist China. What stands between us and this
Kafkaesque nightmare is the right to freedom of speech.

As George Washington said in his Newburg Address, “[if] the freedom of speech is taken away then
dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter."
