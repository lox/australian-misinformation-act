I am against censorship of opinions because we live in a democracy.

# Covid is a great example of fact checkers with no knowledge of anything censoring experts all around the world who have been proven right and government leaders such as all the Premiers, Scott Morrison, Greg Hunt, Brendan Murphy, Brad Hazard and all the Chief Medical Officers and John Skerrit claimed the Covid-19 Injection were safe and effective without even reading any research and relying on the Pharma companies’ information.

 Conflict of interest there. It was clear the political narrative via the mainstream media were all pushing the paid for narrative and the truth was censored.

 As a result lives were lost or destroyed, people with the common sense to doubt an untested new generation of drugs which was only tested on
## a small number of selected groups was safe and effective by the
# misinformation and fear tactics from the government. People have been discriminated against for not taking the Covid-19 and called derogative names and shamed regardless of having ever other vaccine throughout their lives.

 Our society has suffered as highly skilled front line workers are still banded from returning to jobs. Doctors were censored and deregistered by Queensland APRAH for speaking their truth. Nurses, teachers, paramedics, firefighters etc all trained with tax payers money have lost their jobs and now the government is bring overseas workers to fill their vacancies. It is a disgrace.

 Regardless of the truth of many leading experts around the world we see our debating floors of Parliament constantly misused. A Member asks a legitimate question of Government, representing their electorate. The question does not get answered

## It is taken on notice and never responded to. There is ridicule and
# gaslighting of them and yet they bravely press on but are not listened to. Speeches are made to an empty house.

 Government wastes time, ridicules the Member, goes off topic and fails to give an answer. Withholding the truth is as good as lying.

 History show Nazis burning books where those books did not agree with their narrative.

# Truth, no matter how unpalatable, is truth!

## In November 2021 Australia began allowing the fully vaccinated into
# Australia. Eg Omicon arrived via a plane load of fully vaccinated tourists.

 Yet the unvaccinated Australians still in lockdown and not allowed to enter clubs and pubs and gyms were blamed for the spread of the virus.
## It was a pandemic of the unvaccinated which was misinformation from
# the government because they were not allowed entry to those places or
## a cafe without proving their vaccination. The vaccinated are blamed for
# everything from “climate change” to Trump!

 European Parliament questioned a Pfizer representative. She admitted Pfizer DID NOT test their vaccine to stop transmission.

 So why the mandates. How any official could claim it was safe and effective after a 6 month trail on 20,000 people is beyond belief.

 Yet our Government still tells us to get boosted to protect ourselves and those around us?

 Fact is, the official narrative has intentionally or unintentionally been misleading and cost many lives. Meanwhile, many accurate and qualified opinions were wrongly suppressed.

 Pfizer's own documents were initially sealed for 70 years. The product sheet was blank and informed consent was not given to anyone including the injectors giving the inoculations.

 A U.S. Freedom of information request saw the Pfizer document released. Those documents showed about 1400 deaths in the U.S. in the first 10 weeks from Pfizers vaccine!

 The TGAs Database of Adverse Event Notifications for Astrazenica, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines shows masses of serious side affects, including death, yet the public is being told otherwise.

 The TGA has recently released a warning about Curcumin and Turmeric over just ONE death and about 10 reported serious complications. The Covid vaccines are officially shown to be far more dangerous, yet Australians were forced out of jobs and maligned for refusing those injections.

# The misinformation from the government regarding improving ones immune system, fresh air and exercise as well as banning early successful treatments such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for treating covid doesn’t fill me with confidence they are going to be the arbitrators of the truth. Interesting they are the only ones not being censored.

 About 10 months ago, Dr Kerryn Phelps stated she and her partner had serious side effects from the vaccines -also, that Doctors were being prevented from sharing what they had witnessed from the vaccines.

 Many front line workers were giving accounts of ICU being full of vaccinated people with covid, not unvaccinated. Brad Hazzard and Kerry Chant stopped reporting any of that information on the 11.00am reports
## on main stream media.

# Suppressing the truth is as good as lying.

 The same control is now being used for the Voice vote and Climate Change. Only one side backed by untold tax payers money in invested
## in only one side of the debate while the other side is suppressed and
# ridiculed.

## If we dont listen to ALL opinions, we will miss solutions and the
# "mistakes" made will be covered up to save face, hide corrupt behaviour or deliberately mislead Australians into wrong, even deadly decisions.

 Government has shown they don’t deal in facts or truth very well. They cannot be trusted to decide what is truth and what is not.

 We have rules about misleading Parliament. That is because experience shows Politicians may be compromised and cover up dishonesty. Yet they want to be the ones to censor facts

I am against people who refuse to hear others' points of view.

I am against silencing what may well turn out to be truth. I am against
# the government having control over who can speak and what they can
## say.

# Censorship is a very dangerous power in the wrong hands. AUSTRALIANS CANNOT AFFORT THAT RISK!
