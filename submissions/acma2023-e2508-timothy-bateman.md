To whom it may concern,

I am writing this email in regard to the proposed misinformation/disinformation bill.
I firmly oppose it, as it infringes on the basic human right of free speech, freedom of association and ones own pursuit
of truth via ones own research. The government has no right to control the dissemination of what they deem factual
information, or what is not. I do not support the government overreach this bill could enable. Respect the will of
individuals to come to their own conclusions with the available information, rather than dictating to the people what is
or isn't factual. Internet Censorship is essentially modern day book burning, and laws like the ones the AUSTRALIAN
GOVERNMENT proposes, would facilitate equivalent draconian measures.

Sincerely,
Timothy Bateman
