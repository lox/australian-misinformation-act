women and men fought for our freedoms. My great grandparents and great uncles and aunts fought in the war. Was this for
nothing?
We have had freedom of speech and freedom of expression and freedom of association for many years which the government is
seeking to squash. This email is in particular regards to freedom of speech. Whom gives one particular group of people the right
to choose what can and can’t be said? Are they qualified and do they understand all the areas of what is covered in the media.
When I went to university I was always taught skepticism was the underpinning value of earning a degree. From listening to all
different forms of views and showing a hypothesis A is caused from the correlation of B an theory is derived. And of course
from different perspectives people have often challenged the status quo. Now putting university aside we are made from all
walks of life from the person that serves coffee to the ceos of the world. No person usually walk into a ceo role first job it’s
learned from the bottom to the top. Unless you are one of the world leaders that is skipped the food chain and given life on a
platter. Everyone matters and we are all part of a system. Unless freedom of speech is hurting or killing people then it is free for
all. There is no long term data analysis over say 1000 years in regards to climate change so one cannot say in 150 years the
world is heating up. If this was the case the banks wouldn’t allow loans. Stop the propaganda and push for the one world
government and unelected bureaucrats. Time to listen to the people as people know there is more going on beneath the surface
or otherwise there wouldn’t be the need to silence them. Our voice is strong and only silence free speech will be bringing in
communist ways like in Korea and china. We all matter and no one is better than one another
