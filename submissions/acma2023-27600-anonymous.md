I have major concerns about this proposed bill, the first being who will actually be making the decision as to what piece
of content would be deemed as mis or dis information. This is the huge question because this would be decided by
someone using their own opinion and morals and ethics to decide on whether to approve or not some form of content
that is being shared by another person who may have similar or dissimilar views to the ACMA decision makers. We
are all guilty of being too quick to judge someone or something they have said or done. We have caught ourselves
after the fact knowing that we incorrectly judged that person or their opinion. So WE are not the be all and end all of
what should or should not be allowed to be shared.

The second big concern is that all Government Departments are to be excluded from this new legislation. Are you
trying to say that no-one in the Govt ever makes a mistake or says something which is later proven to be false. This
has occurred many times throughout history and especially in the past few years.  In a democracy surely we should
all be bound by the same rules therefore the Govt and the Govt funded bodies and media outlets should all be bound
by the same rules & legislation. Having different rules creates separation and discrimination and paves the way for
only what the Govt wants us to hear to be allowed to be shared. That is not a democracy.

We live in a world or atleast we used to where mutual respect and opinions of others were listened to and heard. We
would sometimes learn something valuable and new and other times we wouldnâ€™t take that opinion on board.
Basically WE are responsible for our own lives and our own decisions, the Government should leave us to explore and
learn and educate ourselves and let us be discerning enough to decide what we believe or not.  The Govt has no right
to tell us as the people what is right and what is wrong. That is for us to decide.

For a true democracy to work we the people should be able to hear, see and speak whatever we like. To learn from
that and grow from that. That will create a more robust society full of new ideas and better ideas for now and for the
future.

Free flow of information and ideas is what has lead to many a brilliant idea and product or service idea that we all
enjoy today. To stifle this freedom of speech is to stifle creation.

There is huge conflict of interest in Govt departments and bodies and big corporations with no-one declaring or very
few times is a declaration of a conflict of interest heard. You cannot decide independently on something if there is a
conflict of interest. It is impossible, you will be swayed.

The Govt clearly does not trust us to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families and our lives. We have
common sense, we have morals and ethics that guide us, we have good brains and thought processes. We are very
capable of working out for ourselves what is true and what is not. All we need in order to make that decision for
ourselves is the free flow of information.

I do not at all support this new bill. It should not come into effect and it should be abolished as it will stop freedom of
speech. I say NO to this bill.
