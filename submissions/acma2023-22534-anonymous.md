Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the Senate Inquiry on the Communicafions
Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023.

I welcome the desire to restrict the spreading of misinformafion and disinformafion on public media.
I also agree that private communicafions should be exempt from the provisions of this bill as proposed.
I also agree that electoral and referendum comments should be exempt.

My chief concern, and the obvious weakness of this proposed legislafion, is who decides what consfitutes
misinformafion and disinformafion. The proposed legislafion could easily be abused by the Australian
Communicafions and Media Authority, or the Government, to control freedom of expression, and to impose
the Government’s views onto the general public by cancelling the general public’s freedom to express
alternafive views. This has the very real potenfial to empower the Government, or the ACMA, to sfifle free
speech, parficularly in areas of moral or social values, by simply calling it misinformafion. Rigorous debate,
Government transparency and public scrufiny could easily be curtailed. This is unacceptable.

Another concern is that by requiring the major media plafforms to monitor, report or comply with such
requirements, with threats of severe penalfies, this may lead these plafforms to withdraw from the
Australian market enfirely. They may deem these requirements too onerous to be bothered complying
with.

I therefore urge the Senate to address these concerns, or withdraw the legislafion.
