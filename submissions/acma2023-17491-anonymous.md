Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts:

As a stakeholder, expert and community member, l object to the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The proposed bill undermines freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that fundamental right
with the notion of combating so-called ‘misinformation’. This is a flawed approach as fundamental
rights cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are undermined.

Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ is subjective and entrusting a government
agency to decide truthfulness raises concerns and is foolish at best. This is all too visible in the
extremist views expressed by out current "e-safety" Commissioner.

Speech, in the form of disinformation and misinformation, cannot cause harm, and defining harm
based on subjective criteria is simply incorrect and a doorway for corruption to enter.

This bill grants inappropriate and excessive control to authorities and will lead to censorship and
corruption.

Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of speech if, and only
if, the Government can define what the supposed threat is.
