Please record my opposition to the proposed Law for the following reasons.

This law is a proposal to prevent anyone, individual or group,from expressing, or having, a different
idea, or opinion to any existing Government / Public Service/ACMA sanctioned and published
information.

This proposal is an insult to all humanity, for the history of all human societies shows that there is no
constant universal truth, least of all government truth.( See Lysenkoism attachment)

The problem with this ridiculous proposal is, who determines the truth about anything? Even recent
history demonstrates that official knowledge and truisms can change in a long or short time.

Seemingly official subject experts have been shown to be less than accurate in their knowledge.

Examples to demonstrate that knowledge cannot be defined or restricted to official dogma abound
and some include, but are not restricted to the following:
Theory of relativity once ridiculed, now generally accepted as a reasonably good explanation of
observations.

Valence bond theory of Linus Pauling was once accepted as the explanation for chemical bonding has
been replaced by a LCAO theory which gives a better account of observations.

Stomach ulcers were officially declared to be as a result of excessive stomach acid in 1910 and all
world treatment was followed in accord with this dictate. It took a brave Australian Medico in 1990s
to show at his own risk that in most cases ulceration is due to a bacterium Helicobacter pylori, this
news was much disputed and ridiculed by the establishment.

The observation that the Earth was a planet in orbit around the Sun was officially declared no only
heretic but also blasphemous and criminally punishable.

The Lysenko episode in Russia under the totalitarian one truth regime of Communism led to the death
by starvation of millions of Russian people, as well as the persecution of anyone who questioned the
theory. (see attached file)

We have been told in recent times, official information by experts that has been shown to be not
quite correct, that:
Take the covid vaccine and you will not get the disease, I know many people who were fully
vaccinated yet suffered the disease,

Take the vaccine and you will not transmit the virus, I know people who were vaccinated yet
transmitted the disease to others.

Get the vaccine and you will not die from the disease, yet people fully vaccinated have died.

Etc, etc.

Factual information in the area of Man made climate change (always abbreviated down to CLIMATE
CHANGE) is distorted to allow Political, Financial, and Totalitarian groups control over the direction
and subservience of the various societies in an attempt to have an unelected body (the UN) the total
control of all.

The IPCC (a Government sponsored group NOT SCIENTIFIC group) under UN direction came up with
computer models that declared the most stupid result, that of all the many factors influencing
Weather (and climate is the 30 Year average of the climate of a region NOT THE world), that CO2 at 4


-----

molecules in every 10,000 air molecules, (one of the lowest historical values), was alone responsible
for all changes in weather averages.

And so the list of not quite accurate official information goes on.

All subjects need to be discussed and debated, then, and only then, do humans even approach
explaining observed reality.

NO CENSORSHIP by Government or Public servants, by their exclusive TRUTH.

[of neurophysiology, cell biology, and many other biological disciplines were](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology)

The government of the Soviet Union (USSR) supported the campaign,

reflected his support for what would come to be known as Lysenkoism,
despite his skepticism toward Lysenko's assertion that all science is classoriented in nature.
