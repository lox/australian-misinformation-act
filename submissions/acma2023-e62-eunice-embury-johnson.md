Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to register my opposition to the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting of Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and I want the government to abandon it. It seems
to me that Freedomof Speech is only to be assigned to those proponents of the Bill and not anyone else. I refuse
to be part of the "thought police" agenda. Truth means a lot to me and those proposing this Bill seem to be
afraid of critical examination of their future proposals and agendas in order to control the populace. The country
is not in a state of anarchy and institutions and Constitution has served us well thus far in maintaining Law and
Order.

Yours faithfully,

Eunice Embury Johnson
