###### SUMMARY

This proposed legislation sets up the Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA)

as a powerful censorship organ of the state. The effect will be that ACMA controls everything
that Australians can see, hear and say online through industry codes of practice enforced by

Big Tech corporations.

This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine what is "untrue,

misleading or deceitful" (misinformation) when they have no such ability. ACMA doesn't know

(and cannot know) what is true. It therefore cannot preside over, set and enforce
misinformation codes of practice.

This is outsourced state censorship, totalitarian in scope, designed to control the public

conversation and camouflaged as protection.

Misinformation is jargon for being wrong, and disinformation is a made-up word for lying.

The government should not be in the business of determining "truth" for the Australian public.

This legislation should therefore be rejected in full.

-----

**1)** **What** **is** **ACMA?**

Australia's media regulator ACMA is a federal government bureaucracy of 514 employees1

formed in 2005 to regulate broadcasting, radiocommunications, telecommunications and
online content.

It does useful things such as planning the radiofrequency spectrum, collecting licensing fees

and fining SMS spammers.2 It regulates broadcasters3 ensuring a percentage of Australian-

made content is aired on TV and radio, and investigates complaints including about decency.

The problems begin when its remit requires it to regulate media content, both broadcast and

online.

ACMA is required to interfere in news and current affairs content, including polemics and talk

shows, using industry codes of practice.

This puts ACMA in a difficult position, turning it into a censorship organ and forcing it to

become an arbiter of truth in areas where such determinations may not even be possible.

**1.1)** **ACMA** **tried** **to** **censor** **the** **internet** **including** **Wikileaks**

An early warning on using ACMA as a censorship bureau came when the Federal Government
tried to "filter" the internet by forcing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block websites it
didn't like.

They sold it as necessary for our safety, to block dangerous crime and child porn.

But during the trial period in 2009, ACMA's government blacklist of banned websites was

leaked and published by WikiLeaks.4 Several Wikileaks sites were on the banned list. Surprise!

Embarrassed, the Federal Government tried to hide the list and denied Wikileaks was on it
(they were). Then they referred the leak to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for criminal

investigation.

with a blacklist, ISPs instead used existing legislation to block Interpol's list of child abuse

websites.5

Turns out, that's all that was needed.

The lesson was learnt about the danger of government censorship. Until now.

**1.2)** **ACMA** **again** **now** **censors** **at** **ISP** **level**

In 2015 a new statutory government office called the eSafety Commissioner was created to

stop bullying and abuse online, including incitement to violence and child abuse material.

All the staff except for eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant are employed by ACMA.6

In 2021 the Online Safety Act was passed beefing up the powers of the office.7

The new laws gave the eSafety Commissioner the power to demand ISPs and social media

services reveal the true identities of anonymous users when investigating complaints about
cyber-bullying or illegal activity.

The Commissioner also got the power to compel ISPs to block websites at server level. Just like

in 2009.

The Commissioner can send a "link deletion notice" or an "app deletion notice" and they must
take it down.8

The legislation created mandatory industry codes to compel ISPs, social media platforms,

search engines, messaging services and app stores to censor illegal and restricted content.

Just like in 2009 it is couched in terms we would all agree on such as banning images of

abhorrent acts (eg: rape) or blocking the streaming of violence such as the Christchurch

massacre.

Just like in 2009 this is marketing to sell you censorship, because illegal acts are covered by

existing legislation.

And here's the problem: this time nobody is going to leak the censorship lists to Wikileaks.

Julian Assange is now locked in a UK prison.

stakeholders" both in Australia and internationally to co-ordinate censorship activities.9

One of these "stakeholders" is the World Economic Forum (WEF), a lobby group of the world's

largest corporations and billionaire oligarchs.10 The WEF pushes for political power through
"stakeholder capitalism".

"Stakeholder capitalism" is a new ideology that wants to supplant old systems like

communism or capitalism with a "fourth industrial revolution". Stakeholder capitalism is all
about sidelining democracy in favour of technocratic control, disguised as philanthropy.11

It's about selection, not election. They appoint people, you don't get to vote for them. It

replaces free speech with selected voices      - and they choose those voices. It is anti-democratic.

It doesn't want you to control your country. Stakeholder capitalism loves the permanent

bureaucracies of government because it can work with them, influence them and capture
them.

It is important to understand the ideology that has infiltrated into the push for this law.

It's not about protecting Australia from harm, it's about controlling the public conversation so

you are not free.

The WEF appointed Commissioner Grant as one of their "#Agile50, the world's most influential

leaders revolutionising government", her profile says,12 and briefed her on the launch of their

digital safety principles in January.13

In 2022 at the WEF's annual Davos shindig, Ms Inman Grant said it would be necessary to

recalibrate human rights online "from freedom of speech to the freedom to be free from
online violence".14

Notice the conflation of speech (words) with violence (a physical act).

produce a report categorising "online harms" in August.15

It listed some real harms such as doxxing and sextortion.

But then comes "misinformation", a made-up term to complicate being wrong, and
"disinformation" which means lying.

This jargon, "misinformation and disinformation", is used to create a problem that seems

technical and difficult to understand so that you might need an "expert".

Permanent Canberra bureaucracies and the WEF are feeding a fake new industry of
"misinformation experts" that is propagated by big PR firms such as Weber Shandwick,16

which represents corporations like WEF partners Pfizer and Moderna.17

These "experts" then produce research to justify the censorship that the bureaucracy wants,

so the state can act.

They traffic in analysis based on these fake terms so the state can seize powers and crush
those who dissent from the agenda.

This is what ACMA did when it commissioned such research to lobby for this legislation (more

on this below).

**In** **reality** **there** **is** **no** **qualification** **that** **enables** **someone** **to** **identify** **misinformation** **in** **a** **way**
**that** **you** **are** **not** **able** **to** **by** **simply** **checking** **provenance** **and** **evidence.**

ACMA, the WEF and the eSafety Commissioner are trying to create a problem in order to
justify censoring the internet.

The joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report reclassifies misinformation (being wrong) and
disinformation (lying) as harms that the government needs to deal with      - as if the worst lies
hadn't repeatedly come from government itself. Australia's TGA still pretends the covid gene­

vaccines prevent you catching and spreading covid after almost every triple-jabbed adult in
the land caught the virus.18

The purpose of the joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report is to provide "foundational
terminology" for "multistakeholder discussions", the report says. That means corporate lobby

report.

"These discussions in turn can facilitate the creation of policies and interventions that
effectively address online harms," it goes on to say.

That is the purpose of terms like "misinformation" and "disinformation" being categorised as

"harms". It justifies the state controlling your speech with "interventions".

Leading journalist Glenn Greenwald has observed that nothing has been more destructive or

dangerous in history than the power of the state to suppress and criminalise opinions it

dislikes. The entire history of human knowledge is nothing more than the realisation that
yesterday's truths are today's shameful errors. 19

**1.4)** **Example** **of** **ACMA** **acting** **as** **a** **Ministry** **of** **Truth**

ACMA has already been using industry codes of practice to interfere in current affairs

broadcasting. It is problematic and time-consuming. Sometimes it's simply not possible to
know what the "truth" is in cases of disputed science.

So this legislation outsources the bother of comment and post deletions to the Big Tech
platforms. Google, Meta et al will censor your speech according to ACMA's rules set out in the
industry code, but without bothering ACMA with the nitty gritty. With the advent of Al this will

be easy: the algorithms can do most of the work.

As an added bonus, ACMA gets to pretend this is some kind of protection of your freedom,

since the state will not itself be doing the deleting      - as if that makes any difference since they

set the rules.

This is not a joke.

The factsheet for this legislation includes "ACMA will not have the power to request specific
content or posts be removed from digital platform services" as an example of "strong
protections for privacy and freedom of speech".20

In reality there are no protections at all for your privacy or freedom of speech in this power

grab.

Here follows an example of how ACMA has previously been forced to act as an arbiter of
"truth" in current affairs programming due to industry codes of practice.

**codes** **of** **practice**

ACMA investigated a religious program that hosted a medical doctor who questioned the

covid gene-vaccines in September 2021.21

"We're seeing an uptick in the laboratory of reactivated other viruses; Epstein-Barr, herpes

viruses, HRV viruses, we're seeing an uptick in certain cancers, already," said the doctor on
subscription cable TV show _Ministry_ _Now._

ACMA investigated this statement and found it to be "not accurate" and a breach of the
industry code of practice on accuracy.22

ACMA didn't know whether it was accurate or not. It couldn't know. It was too soon in 2021 to

know if the gene-vaccines cause cancer. Studies take time to design, conduct, get accepted,
peer reviewed and published.

How could anyone see whether the mRNA products cause cancers in a year, or even six
months, when both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials destroyed their control group23 after
just 2.5 months? There was nobody to compare it to.

The best we could do was to have doctors sound the alarm over what they were seeing, which

is exactly what the doctor did on _Ministry_ _Now._

The licensee didn't provide ACMA with studies to prove the cancer risk, and ACMA couldn't

find any. The product had been on the market for less than a year.

Google censored search results in 2021 and 2022 making it difficult to find published studies
criticising the gene-vaccines. Google discredited the voices of scientists warning of its terrible

side-effects by elevating parody accounts that mocked them or spurious "fact-checks" to

from being emailed.25

ACMA ruled the doctor's statement false and a breach of the code because it could find no

relevant evidence.

It made its decision on what it could find: an AP "fact-check"26 (now removed) that
"debunked" a _Natural_ _News_ story about how mRNA gene-vaccines can cause cancer, claiming
it misrepresented a 2018 study. But this had no bearing on whether the doctor's claim was
true or not.

Australian health authorities said the gene-vaccines were safe for cancer sufferers to use      - but

this was also irrelevant to the accuracy of the doctor's claim as there were no placebo-
controlled studies done on cancer sufferers to prove this.

Now you see the deadly danger of censorship.

ACMA ruled against the narrow-caster of the pay TV program even though it cannot know that
what the doctor said was "not accurate".

It has now been shown that the gene-vaccines can indeed activate cancers.

They have also been shown to reactivate latent viruses including herpes.

A peer-reviewed paper by Seneff et al from June 202227 reviews the medical literature. It

explains how the gene-vaccines downregulate critical pathways related to cancer surveillance

and infection control in the body leading to an increased risk of certain cancers and the

reactivation of viruses, including herpes.

vaccination, as detailed in _The_ _Atlantic,_ September 2022.28

safe answer when medical opinions differ is to let doctors be doctors, and air their thoughts

The landing page for this proposed legislation states the powers created are consistent with
the recommendations in ACMA's June 2021 report to government on the adequacy of digital
platforms' disinformation and news quality measures.32

To bolster this report, ACMA commissioned research from the University of Canberra's News

and Media Research Centre and from social media consultancy We Are Social.33

The University of Canberra research conducted a survey and interviewed focus groups about
their opinions and experiences of "misinformation" and "disinformation".

Where required participants were given the definitions provided by ACMA: 'Misinformation'

was defined as the inadvertent sharing of false information, while 'disinformation' was

defined as the deliberate creation and sharing of information known to be false," the report
states.34

The real problem then begins: how do you know what is true and what is wrong? How do you
know if someone is deliberately lying? Can you read their mind? Perhaps _you_ are wrong.

The entire premise of this research is intrinsically subjective.

This is a problem of epistemology. It can't be solved by research such as this.

Who decides what misinformation is? How is it determined?

So the researchers were left with individuals describing things they thought were
misinformation. Again, highly subjective.

In the survey methodology for determining whether a person was "Covid-19 informed vs
misinformed", the researchers state:

_"The_ _questions_ _addressing_ _misinformation_ _beliefs_ _are_ _designed_ _to_ _assess_ _agreement_ _with_

_appropriate_ _treatment..._ _Those_ _who_ _are_ _in_ _general_ _disagreement_ _with_ _the_ _authoritative_ _or_

ACMA recognised this in its June 2021 report to government, which made the key

recommendation that it wanted censorship powers.

get their news. This provided lots of charts and graphs and percentages to provide the

impression of an objective, apolitical, data-driven, measurable, factual and scientific report.

This camouflages the highly political, subjective part of the report, and helps ACMA appear
authoritative and informed when making its case for censorship tools to suppress dissent.

These figures basically showed large numbers of people get their news from social media     -

which is exactly why the government wants to control social media.

The second report that ACMA relied on to ask for more powers, is the We Are Social network

analysis, which ACMA provided to _Letters_ _From_ _Australia_ in response to a media request.

This report is called: _"Social_ _media_ _insights_ _into_ _how_ _online_ _misinformation_ _and_ _disinformation_

_are_ _being_ _spread_ _across_ _social_ _platforms_ _in_ _Australia"_

The assumptions are built right into the headline.

Researchers trawled the internet with keywords to find "misinformation" posts in order to
count them, to quantify human comments and conversations into objective sounding

percentages, tables, bar charts, ven diagrams and authoritative graphs.

They decided on three "key narratives" that were "misinformation" to count: anti-lockdown +

Q.-anon, anti-vaccine and anti-5G.37

Again, these categories are all subjective and highly political.

What is "anti-vaccine"? People whose whole careers were dedicated to making vaccines, such

as Canadian vaccinologist were labelled "anti-vaxxers" in 2021 and 2022

because they raised concerns over a rushed new class of product.

"Anti-lockdown" was lumped in with "Q-anon" as one category, as though people must be
unhinged to oppose the shut-down of the economy over a relatively mild virus that had a

global infection fatality rate of less than 0.03 percent for under-60s, before vaccines, in its

more virulent form.38 Why? Because sometimes the conversations would "overlap".

The assumptions are breathtaking.

This is junk science. It's not real science.

Here is a snip from page 24 to illustrate how "misinformation research" paints opinionated

and subjective judgements of other people's ideas as objectively quantifiable science. Pink
text, arrows, underlines are mine.

The most engaging pieces of content under the anti-vax narrative focused on the government's plan for
mandatory COVID-19 vaccines and the promotion of an Inade^uatel^teste^accine^ This included a
meme post suggesting that readers should not put faith in a vaccine but in God, and a video falsely
alleging that 80% of people who tried a COVID-19 vaccine experienced systemic side effects, r

###### guilt by association fallacy here

Notice how "anti-vax narrative" is here defined as being against the government's coerced

injections of gene-vaccines.

Notice how this misrepresents these people as being against all vaccines, which demonises
their position by exaggeration.

These products were bought by the government before testing was even finished.39 They were

developed in less than a year despite being an entirely new class of drug with a novel

mechanism of action, even though the safety and manufacturing testing for traditional

vaccines ordinarily takes 10 to 15 years.

Notice the "guilt by association" fallacy which smears those with concerns about the

inadequate testing of the gene-vaccines (a real problem) with people who allegedly said put
your faith in God instead of a vaccine.

This report confuses opinion with "misinformation", as the meme shows (below, next page,

pink text is mine).

But the fact that this entire report is pseudoscience is not the fault of the researchers.

The entire class of "misinformation and disinformation" research is junk for the exact same

reason. The premise is wrong.

When given the remit by ACMA to go and quantify "misinformation" on the internet, the

researchers did their best.

But they cannot help producing exactly what you see, because it's not possible to determine
what is true and what is not. It's a loaded judgement and always will be.

The government told Australians that an entirely new class of drug (a provisionally registered

gene-vaccine that was rushed to market with barely any testing) was safe and effective. It
didn't work and it's so unsafe that thousands of Australians have injuries and an unknown
number have died.40

ACMA now wants to censor "misinformation" to stop people talking about it, and their own

research clearly shows that they consider "misinformation" to be disagreeing with whatever
the official government advice is at the time.

ACMA cannot actually define "misinformation" (being wrong), as they admit in their June 2021
report to government. It is "constantly shifting" and there are "difficulties in assessing

falsehoods", the report says.

ACMA 2021 “Report to Government on the Adequacy of Digital
**Misinformation** **by** **platform**
Platforms’ Disinformation and News Quality Measures’^.17

Given the constantly shifting nature of misinformation, difficulties in assessing
falsehoods, and the challenges in accessing relevant data, it is not possible to quantify
the true scale and volume of misinformation in Australia. However, consumer surveys
and open-source network analysis can help provide insights into which platforms are
at higher risk and help provide a baseline for future assessments.

"misinformation" during the pandemic to censor anyone who got in the way of coerced gene­

vaccines, at the request of governments including Australia.

These corporations attacked Australia's democracy by censoring elected members of
Parliament.

Below are two excerpts from the ACMA report. The first, from page 1 justifying censorship.

The second, diarising the Facebook suppression of elected federal MP Craig Kelly.

###### The online propagation of disinformation and misinformation presents an increasing threat to Australians June 2021 ac n ia report, page 1

 Over the previous 18 months, we have seen increasing concern within the community over the ‘infodemic’ of online disinformation and misinformation, particularly in relation to the real-world impacts of COVID-19. The propagation of these falsehoods and conspiracies undermines public health efforts, causes harm to individuals, businesses and democratic institutions, and in some cases, incites individuals to carry out acts of violence. ___>

26 Apr **Facebook** permanently removes Craig Kelly MP's Facebook and Instagram
accounts for repeated violations of its COVID-19 misinformation policy.
A Facebook spokesperson noted: ‘We don't allow anyone, including elected
officials, to share misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to imminent
physical harm or COVID-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public
health experts. We have clear policies against this type of content and have
removed Mr Kelly's Facebook Page for repeated violations of this policy’.241

Cardiologists are now calling for their suspension.

Instead of condemning the censorship of a sitting Member of Parliament, ACMA's June 2021
report to government slandered Craig Kelly as a "misinformation" super-spreader.

Mr Kelly resigned from the Liberal Party after being hassled by Prime Minister Scott Morrison

covid treatment, with the scientific discussion ongoing.43

The gene-vaccines were secured by Mr Morrison's government under secret billion-dollar

contracts before testing was even finished and have now been proven to cause heart damage

as well as failing to prevent covid. Despite being right in his criticisms, Mr Kelly lost his seat
after being demonised for "covid misinformation" and suppressed by social media.

Facebook suppressed Senator Gerrard Rennick's post of the true story of Faith Ranson, a

Tasmanian teenager suffering a covid gene-vaccine injury, as per the screenshot compilation
from Facebook below. Facebook doesn't allow people to talk about gene-vaccine side-effects.

People on Facebook still cannot share Senator Rennick's post because Facebook defined it as
"against community standards on misinformation that could cause physical harm". That's

because it accurately states that the Pfizer gene-vaccine injured her.44

-----

Just last month, Facebook removed a video of newly elected NSW Senator John Ruddick's

maiden speech to Parliament citing its medical misinformation policies.45

That is the kind of political censorship this legislation will entrench and expand.

###### 3.1) "Misinformation" is a term used to control media

This proposed law will shut down what's left of the free press.

The term "misinformation" is already used to threaten reporters, to control language, to make
journalists compliant.

Here I use my own example, as a journalist writing on Substack for _Letters_ _From_ _Australia._

I often write on the covid gene-vaccines and so I submit media requests to the TGA.

In a reply on June 30, the TGA tried to police my language, to force me to use the preferred
marketing term for these products: "vaccine".

Snip from a Health Department media response 30/06/2023. threatening a lOurnalist by re-defining the
correct description of gene-vaccines as "false and misleading’ These terms carry censorship weight under
the proposed new law meaning the journalist can be destroyed by being deplatformed from the internet

-see a responsa below wbich cars be altributeo ks a TGA spokesperson

how do you know whelhe-r all the gene-vaccine injuries and deaths have been reported to Ihe TGA fw investigation?

tl rs false and p- siBading Io represent COVID-15 mHNA vaccines as gene vaccines', 'gene ibsrapy' ar ijsne iechnolcgy'. It is a scientific fad thai mRNA

vaccines do not interact with a Tecipiemt'S DNA in any way.

"It is false and misleading to represent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as 'gene vaccines', 'gene
therapy' or 'gene technology'. It is a scientific fact that mRNA vaccines do not interact with a
recipient's DNA in any way," the TGA says.

I made no mention of "DNA" or "therapy".

The TGA and other gene-vaccine promoters want the public to confuse this new class of

products with traditional vaccines that have long been trusted as safe.

That's why they don't like the term "gene-vaccines"      - it's a new category that you must think
about. The entire mechanism of action is radically different and new.

Traditional vaccines deliver an exactly measured dose of dead or weakened virus.

These new gene-vaccines hijack your cell's machinery to create an unknown dose of non­

human spike proteins using the genetic sequence of a virus.

The term gene-vaccine is accurate, and so I continue to use it.

45 "YouTube censors Australian politician's maiden speech to parliament, cites 'medical misinformation'," Rebekah Barnett,
_Dystopian_ _Downunder,_ Substack, 2 July 2023. Accessed 20 August 2023 at https://news.rebekahbarnett.com.au/p/youtube-censors-


-----

_Please_ _note:_ _the_ _term_ _"gene-vaccine"_ _is_ _both_ _accurate_ _and_ _necessary_ _to_ _distinguish_ _these_
_products_ _from_ _ordinary_ _vaccines._ _Unlike_ _ordinary_ _vaccines,_ _these_ _products_ _instruct_ _cells_ _to_

_produce_ _non-human_ _spike_ _proteins_ _using_ _a_ _genetic_ _sequence_ _from_ _the_ _sars-cov-2_ _virus._ _This_
_term_ _does_ _not_ _make_ _reference_ _to_ _interference_ _with_ _DNA._

Using the sinister words "false and misleading" carries legal weight under this proposed

legislation.

Think of what that means to a journalist in the context of legislation being passed to force the
internet (including Substack) to take down "misinformation"

My Substack could be taken down under this new law, and I could be disappeared from the
internet. All that would have to happen is a complaint from the Department of Health and

Aged Care to Substack, calling my work "misinformation" (even though it isn't).

Although the legislation has a provision exempting "professional news media" it is unknown
whether this would cover a writer on Substack. How are they going to define that? Would that

be restricted to the servile corporate media houses?

###### 3.2) Corporate media hit despite phony "protection"

The corporate media will not escape this censorship despite the phony exemption for

"professional news media".

Newspapers and the journalists whose bylines are in them are reliant on social media sharing
for their voices to be amplified.

The goal of news websites such as Daily Mail Australia or [News.com.au](news://News.com.au) is to have their stories

go viral. That brings ad revenue. It's the business model. For individual journalists whose

byline is on the story, it's the metric of success. They chase clicks.

hey won't get clicks and will be discouraged

This may explain why corporate media was so deferential during the pandemic that it failed to

do its basic job.

Incentivised censorship has proven to be far more effective for government than ordering
journalists what to print. It's hidden and they police themselves.

Journalists dependent on clicks can also have their careers destroyed by personal blacklisting.

The government doesn't have to tell media outlets not to run stories critical of gene-vaccines,
they just go nowhere, regardless of how worthy or true or important they are.

Traditional media outlets also have revenue sharing agreements under the news media
bargaining code with tech platforms Meta (Facebook YouTube Instagram) and Google


-----

media whose work is shared widely on their platforms. This is another incentive to keep
traditional journalism in line with any new digital codes.

They won't risk stepping out of line.

###### 3.3) ACMA loves these outsourced censorship tactics

ACMA's 2021 report diarised social media platform censorship events across 2020 and 2021,

"against key social and political events that have impacted disinformation and misinformation
trends" in a handy timeline.46 47

_"Platform_ _responses_ _include_ _policy_ _changes,_ _enforcement_ _actions,_ _changes_ _to_ _the_ _platform_
_features_ _and_ _functions,_ _and_ _other_ _actions_ _and_ _initiatives._ _Almost_ _all_ _policy_ _changes_ _and_ _new_

_initiatives_ _identified_ _by_ _the_ _ACMA_ _have_ _been_ _in_ _response_ _to_ _either_ _the_ _COVID-19_ _pandemic_ _or_
_the_ _2020_ _US_ _presidential_ _election."_

ACMA's assumption, in this diary of events and techniques, is that the authorities, fact­

checkers and social media platforms were right.

They weren't. The misinformation was from _them,_ a lot of the time

Many orthodoxies about both the 2020 US presidential election and the covid pandemic were
wrong.

Another example: covid did not have a high infection fatality rate even in its most virulent

early strains before the gene-vaccines. It was overwhelmingly a disease of the frail-aged

elderly, morbidly obese and Vitamin D deficient.

Stanford Epidemiology Professor John loannidis found a global infection fatality rate of less
than 0.03 percent for non-elderly populations, defined as the under-60s, in a widely respected

and cited peer-reviewed study published in 2022.48

persecuted by the state across the Anglosphere

At the direct request of Australia's Department of Home Affairs51 and Department of Health52,

both Twitter and Facebook took down posts from gene-vaccine injured people looking for help

because they got in the way of the "safe and effective" gene-vaccine messaging campaign

already planned in November 2020.53 54 *

That's because he co-authored the 2020 Great Barrington Declaration with Harvard University
professor of medicine Martin Ku I Idorff and Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta to

warn the world that the the best covid strategy was not lockdowns at all but to protect the

elderly (who had a thousand-fold higher death risk) while allowing the young to develop

herd immunity from natural infection.

Substack became a home for real journalism. Rumble and Bitchute were the free speech

alternatives to YouTube. Scientists and doctors and gene-vaccine injured people could talk

about what was happening there, and on Telegram.

There are conspiracy theories and wild fantasists there too, but so what? That's freedom.

ACMA does not want these corners of respite to exist at all.

The purpose of this new law is to crush the dissidents on these places, too, so there is

nowhere for them to share their stories on the internet at all.

This can be seen in Fact Sheet 3 that accompanied ACMA's June 2021 report to
government requesting new powers.

Under the heading "Scoping new regulatory powers for the ACMA", the fact sheet

complained that "conspiratorial communities" could seek out alternative platforms to

avoid moderation (censorship) and that because their codes of practise were voluntary

platforms could ignore them.

They want the power to force all platforms to censor for them.

They wrote:

_"The_ _ACMA_ _recommended_ _that_ _government_ _should_ _provide_ _it_ _with_ _reserve_ _powers_ _to_

_register_ _industry_ _codes,_ _enforce_ _industry_ _code_ _compliance_ _and_ _make_ _standards_ _relating_ _to_

_the_ _activities_ _of_ _digital_ _platforms._ _These_ _powers_ _would_ _provide_ _a_ _mechanism_ _forfurther_

_intervention_ _if_ _code_ _administration_ _arrangements_ _prove_ _inadeguate,_ _or_ _the_ _voluntary_
_industry_ _code_ _fails._ _The_ _government_ _has_ _accepted_ _this_ _recommendation."56_

They even created a "Misinformation and Disinformation Action Group" to expedite their

censorship drive.

Thanks to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter and the excellent journalism of Matt Taibbi and

a team of investigative reporters at Racket News, the public learnt that the mass

censorship of social media over the last three years was at the direct request of the US

security state, its five-eyes allies (including Australia) and a linked network of more than 50

agencies, foundations and university-linked think tanks that draw funding to promote the
censorship-industrial complex.57

protected right to free speech, that a court case was launched which resulted in an

extraordinary ruling on July 4 temporarily banning the FBI and Biden Administration officials
from even contacting social media firms for the purpose of censorship that would infringe on
the First Amendment free speech rights of Americans.58

Australia has no free speech protections in law at all other than a weak implied right to
political communication in the constitution.

But if this legislation goes through, the Big Tech platforms may apply these "misinformation"

censorship codes internationally, across their operations, including in the US and Canada and

New Zealand    - giving the US security state everything it wanted and pressured them for and

more, bypassing the First Amendment because Big Tech can say "we chose to have these
industry codes".

###### 6) IN CONCLUSION:

        - "Misinformation and disinformation" is a fake problem, small in scope. Wrong
information on the internet is not a big threat to Australians

        - A sinister danger is instead posed by state control of information and government
policies that cannot be challenged by loud and uncontrolled dissent

        - Our safety and wellbeing is guaranteed only by a robust marketplace of ideas where

people are able to be heard, even when they are wrong

        - A parasitic industry of fake "misinformation and disinformation" experts has been

created to justify censorship. There is no qualification that enables "experts" to identify
wrong information in a way that we are not able to

        - This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine what is
"untrue, misleading or deceitful" (misinformation) when they have no such ability.

ACMA doesn't know what is true. It therefore cannot preside over misinformation

codes of practise

        - Several examples of "dangerous misinformation" that ACMA used to lobby for these

powers turned out later to be factually accurate, or just different opinions that
challenged government messaging

        - This legislation is a power grab by an unelected bureaucracy that would get to decide
what "misinformation" is for all of us and ban it, strangling our democracy

        - Under this legislation ACMA would set the censorship rules, called "misinformation

industry codes" but outsource the implementation to Big Tech corporations. This allows
the state to hide behind corporate partners in order to pretend that they are not
censoring. The technical definition of corporate-state combines is "fascism"

        - ACMA are the ones with the final say on the "misinformation and disinformation codes
of practice" under this legislation, which they would have the power to enforce

        - Unelected bureaucrats including former police officers and security state operatives at

ACMA would determine "truth" for the whole country: what can be seen, heard or
written about online. Whatever they don't like would be censored as "misinformation".


-----

"misinformation" back to ACMA. This inflates ACMA's importance so they can traffic in

analysis and ask for even more money, power, people and research to "solve" the fake

problem that they themselves created

        - ACMA, an unelected bureau, would have the power to create legislative instruments,

making its own rules and sidelining our elected legislators

        - This legislation will crush dissident voices from alternative media where they found

refuge during the covid pandemic. This is deliberate.

        - This legislation exempts "professional news" which is not defined, but includes the
compliant corporate media houses that heavily censored content during the pandemic.
It is not possible for media to be free and adversarial if it has to partner with and be

recognised by the state in order to publish. This is the manner in which North Korea
permits KCNA to publish as "professional news". Freedom is guaranteed by diverse and

chaotic voices that the government can't control by registration, industry standards or
the centralised ownership of a few big players

        - This legislation will back-engineer censorship to the (already compliant) corporate

media outlets such as Daily Mail, Nine Newspapers or [News.com.au](news://News.com.au) which need social

media shares and Google search visibility for audience and revenue sharing. Journalists
who might otherwise refuse overt state censorship will be manipulated by incentives to
comply with "industry standards"

        - Australia already has laws to deal with criminal behaviour such as incitement to
violence, fraud and child porn. Criminal acts are a matter for the police using the

extensive powers they already have. New censorship rules are not needed

        - This legislation carries no protection for free speech at all, despite the Department
dishonestly claiming to do so by not giving ACMA the power to request specific posts be

removed. ACMA doesn't want or need to micromanage because the platforms are

forced to do it for them.

        - ACMA and the Federal Government should have exactly zero say in censoring the voices
of Australians even when they are wrong or misinformed

_This_ _legislation_ _cannot_ _be_ _allowed_ _to_ _pass_ _in_ _any_ _form._
