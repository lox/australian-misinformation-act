**TO** **WHOM** **IT** **MAY** **CONCERN** **at** **the** **Department** **of** **Infrastructure,** **Transport,**

**Regional** **Development,** **Communications** **and** **the** **Arts:**

**The** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment** **(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and**

**Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023** **must** **not** **proceed.** **It** **an** **appalling** **piece** **of** **proposed** **legislation**

**that** **threatens** **to** **destroy** **this** **nation.**

Australia is a democracy. This Bill is a fundamental threat to democracy because it

undermines freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that fundamental right with the

notion of combatting so-called ‘misinformation’. Fundamental rights cannot be balanced

against anything; instead they are undermined.

Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ is subjective and entrusting a

government agency to decide truthfulness raises enormous concerns. The Bill's vague

definitions of "misinformation" and "disinformation" are open to interpretation and abuse by

those in power. And then there is the question of who decides what is ‘misinformation’ and

‘disinformation’. There are so many instances where official fact-checkers have gotten it

wrong.

The definition of ‘harm’ in the proposed bill is also highly subjective, encompassing anything

deemed hateful, disruptive, or harmful to society, democracy, environment, and economy ...

and more. These terms are open to interpretation and cannot be considered facts.

Furthermore, content published by professional news outlets and various levels of

government and educational institutions will **not** be considered as misinformation. This

assumes and implies **_excluded_** **_content_** is information, which is not necessarily true.

What happens when readers and citizens question or discuss **_excluded_** **_content_** as

misinformation (which _"contains_ _information_ _that_ _isfalse,_ _misleading_ _or_ _deceptive"}?_ How

can misinformation of **_excluded_** **_content_** be discussed using digital services?

The Bill grants excessive control to authorities and will lead to further censorship. Censorship

is already a major and increasing problem in Australia.

The proposed "Ministry of Truth" is sinister and dangerous. Please read George Orwell's

1984 and decide if this is the sort of future you wish for your children and grandchildren.


-----

Together we can decide what sort of world we want to live in and the future we want for our

children and grandchildren. The proposed new powers for combatting misinformation and

disinformation are inconsistent with a democracy which must allow dissenting views to be

expressed and discussed freely. Let us not allow Australia to descend into a totalitarian future

where our right to speak up is silenced forever.

**The** **legislation** **is** **poorly** **considered** **and** **must** **be** **withdrawn** **without** **further**

**amendment.**

Yours faithfully
