# Submission from Gerard & Denise O’Brien
 We are extremely concerned with the government’s proposed misinformation/disinformation legislation. This is the end of free speech which has already been eroded to the detriment of a free and democratic society.
 The biggest problem is that the decision lies in the hands of the government as to what is deemed misinformation. A government which has exempted itself from being prosecuted under this legislation, even though they are often the main offenders of disinformation. Unconstitutional, unbelievable and extremely dangerous.
