I am an Australian citizen who values the freedoms my ancestors fought for in 2 World Wars and countless other battles. We
have a pluralistic society and a multicultural community as a result of their courage and sacrifice. This means we have a huge
diversity of people, cultures, religions and ways of life. We have different perspectives and opinions and value different things.
My ancestors did not fight, and some even died, so that I would be forced to live in a totalitarian state. The repugnance all
Australian people feel towards that type of dictatorial regime is still strong and alive today.

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right that my ancestors fought and died for, and it must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective.
What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It is
simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity. Why is the Australian government trying to turn our free and
tolerant society into a Communist state??

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. Shane on all who
are trying to silence people from expressing their views and opinions!! This proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

We voted for a Government that would protect the rights and freedoms for which our ancestors made the ultimate sacrifice.
Don’t let us down!

This appalling bill must be rejected.
