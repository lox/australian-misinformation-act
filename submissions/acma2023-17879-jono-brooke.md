To Whom it may concern,

It is with the deepest regard for freedom and truth that i write this. It is simply not possible for me to
convey in a few short comments my utter disdain and absolute disgust for this proposed bill and
therefore for the politician and party that is attempting to introduce it.

The open and free exchange of ideas and the exchange of dialogue is what has always driven
civilisation forward, whenever and wherever that is limited we deny the most basic and fundamental
human right of expression, we deny the ability for truth to prevail and we deny the opportunity for
civilisation to grow and flourish.

It is the right of every individual to have the freedom to express their ideas and opinions, and it is
the right of every other individual to agree or disagree - that is how a functioning society works. This
attempt by a government to insert a panel or body that would determine what is truth is wholly
inappropriate and oversteps the boundaries of the governments intended purpose. In truth, any
government that would seek to pass legislation intended to limit the freedom of speech of its
citizens, while cynically excluding itself from the very same rules shows its cowardice and declares
loudly to the world that it is not fit to govern.

Let me be clear and formally state here that under no circumstances should this bill or any like it
ever be allowed to be passed in this or any other ‘free’ country.
