CANBERRA ACT 2600

Dear Ms Rowland,

The purpose of this letter is to express my opinions regarding the proposed misinformationÂ­
disinformation legislation which the government seeks to introduce into parliament in 2023, entitled
'Communications Legislation Amendment(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)Bill 2023, to

be controlled by the Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA).

Providing some historical background, in Feb 2021, at the request of the former government, requiring
online platforms to develop a code of practice, The Australian Code of Practice on Misinformation and
Disinformation was launched.by Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI). In Jan 2023, the Minister for
Communications announced that the Australian government will introduce new laws to provide ACMA
with the power to combat misinformation and disinformation. Submissions have been requested by
the government regarding this proposed legislation.to "seek your views" on the draft bill as to
"whether the proposed legislation strikesan appropriate balance of a range of issues" and "the
proposed powers seek to strike a balance between the public interest in combatting the serious harms
that can arise from the propagation of misinformation and disinformation, with freedom of speech"
and "the Bill aims to incentivise digital platform providers .... to address misinformation and
disinformation" and "the Bill does not seek to curtail freedom of speech". I note that "harm" includes:
to the integrity of Australia, democratic processes, health of Australians and the Australian
environment, or economy. Additionally, I note that "content authorised by the government of the
Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a local government area will be exempt" from this legislation.

To start, I wish to point out differing political ideologies. A democracy is a form of government in
which power is held by the people, where elected representatives of the people make laws for the
people, advocating private ownership and respecting individual rights and freedom. Compare this, for
example, to socialism, which is a form of government in which the power is held by the government,
where the government makes laws for the people, advocating collective ownership and not altogether
respecting individual rights and freedom. Compare this to totalitarianism, which is a form of
government centralised and dictatorial, where people are totally controlled by the state. As
Australians, we strive for a free democratic society.

I will make two main points which indicate my objection to this proposed legislation.

Firstly, considering the government's response recently, and its performance, in managing the Covid
situation since the rollout in early 2021, I am astonished it has either the trust or support of the
Australian people to consider itself an appropriately qualified arbiter in deciding what would
constitute misinformation or disinformation.

Misinformation and disinformation was and is prolific since the start of the Covid situation, and the
government authorities are not exempt from the propagation of or dissemination of misinformation
and disinformation at the federal or state government level.
This is just one important and regrettable example in which the decision-making processes undertaken
by the government(s) were at a minimum, questionable and at a maximum, unconscionable. Federal
government maintains that these were decisions for state governments to make, but these decisions
were nonetheless often supported by the federal government in implementing legislation. Some
examples of this are detailed as follows:

In Jan 2021, Mr S Morrison (former PM) and Mr G Hunt (Minister for Health), in a media release
regarding the rollout of Covid vaccinations, stated: "our own experts finding it safe and effective and
of a high standard", "the vaccine has been approved as effective in in stopping severe disease" and
"the TGA has placed safety above all else". Then, in Feb 2021, in an interview between Mr G Hunt and
Mr D Speers (ABC), Mr G Hunt stated: "it's safe, it's effective", "prevention of serious illness,
hospitalisation and death has been determined to be up to 100 percent"," the world is engaged in the
largest clinical trial, the largest global vaccination trial ever", and "anybody should feel free speak with
their doctor". Then, in Mar 2021, AHPRA and National Medical Boards released a Position Statement
to medical practitioners stating: "any promotion of anti-vaccination statements which seeks to
actively undermine the national immunisation campaign is not supported" and "may be subject to
regulatory action" which was indeed the case. The Prime Minister, Premiers, CMO's and "experts"
came forth espousing the safety and efficacy of these experimental drugs, not knowing the future
medical ramifications of taking them. I am aware that these individuals were often opposition
politicians. Nonetheless, how could either the federal or state government representatives have made
these statements at the inception of the rollout and upon what scientific basis were they made? By
the government's own admission, these drugs were experimental. Later, Dr Phillip Altman in 'The Time
of Covid' (Australia), referring to ABS, DAEN and TGA data stated: 100,180 Covid related adverse
events were recorded compared to 19,330 in the previous 50 years from all non-Covid vaccines. Also,

a 10-20 percent excess mortality prevails and nothing is done. During this time, our governments
enforced employment mandates, lockdowns, restriction on movement, restriction on speech, school
closures, restrictions on gatherings, etc. A draconian imposition was experienced on our society, and
our democracy was under threat. Now, most people now know that these injections had no effect on
either infection or transmission and were not safe and effective. There have been no enquiries, no
debates, no discussions of note. This information was and still is generally suppressed or censored and
primarily unpublished by mainstream media. No dissent from this program of vaccination was or is
tolerated, and those who did not comply were labelled conspiracy theorists, condemned, ridiculed and
considered selfish. This has been a sad chapter in our history with the government enforcing such
draconian measures on our society, denying basic rights to individuals, and to freedom. The
government showed us it was prepared to embrace the concept of and enforce upon us,
totalitarianism (these are the rules which you will follow). This is a form of government which is the
opposite of a free democracy. Yet, the government is asking us what our opinions are regarding their
proposed misinformation-disinformation legislation, with their intention of being the arbiter of
misinformation and disinformation.

Secondly, Australia is a country, which from its settlement, has embraced the principles of a free
democratic society. A society which values the concepts of honesty, transparency, consultation,
communication and the respect for individual freedom: freedom of speech, opinion and movement. I
believe we all need to fight to enjoy and maintain a free democratic society, where each individual has
the freedom and right to engage in, contribute to and form part of the decision making process in the
laws that govern us at all levels, through the process of representative government.

The government should interact with and engage with those they are elected to represent and policy
should be a reflection of that interaction and consultation process. The opposite of that is a society
where these values which represent freedom are denied or ignored or not listened to. We do not
want a repeat of what happened in the last few years where totalitarian rule penetrated and infected
our purportedly free democratic society.

Freedom of speech should not be hindered, obfuscated or denied, either at digital platform level or an
individual level. Freedom of speech is a fundamental ingredient of a free democratic society. This bill
undermines the right and will discourage and penalise any dissent of the government narrative. As
Australians, we must fight for our democracy, as our forebears have, and object to any proposed
legislation such as or like this. It is totally unacceptable.

I request a personal (not only auto generated) written response to this correspondence.

Regards,

Mr Brenton Moss
