**Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**

**2023**

ACCAN thanks the Department of Industry, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and
the Arts (the Department) for the opportunity to comment on the draft Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

ACCAN is the peak body that represents all consumers on communications issues including
telecommunications, broadband and emerging new services. ACCAN provides a strong unified voice
to industry and government as consumers work towards communications services that are trusted,
inclusive and available for all.

ACCAN is keen to ensure that the voices and experiences of consumers are appropriately protected
from potential harms resulting from disinformation and misinformation propagated across digital
platforms. As such, our comments reflect the interests of consumers in the context of
communications services and more broadly, as users of digital platform services.

This submission will first address some general concerns and then comment more specifically on the
draft Bill.

## General Comments

ACCAN supports the Government’s commitment to increase consumer protections against the
propagation of disinformation and misinformation via digital platform services in Australia. The
development and implementation of the voluntary industry Australian Code of Practice on
_Disinformation and Misinformation (the Code) has been a good first step.[1]_

ACCAN has previously engaged in the Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI) consultations on the Code.
Our comments to the first review of the Code in 2022 made a number of recommendations to
improve the code’s efficacy in providing greater transparency about the mechanisms which the Code
signatories have implemented to improve consumer protection against disinformation and
misinformation.[2]

Our submission endorsed the following recommendations from the Australian Communications and
Media Authority (ACMA) 2021 report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms’
disinformation and news quality measures.

Recommendation 3: To incentivise greater transparency, the ACMA should be provided with formal
information-gathering powers (including powers to make record keeping rules) to oversee digital
platforms, including the ability to request Australia-specific data on the effectiveness of measures to
address disinformation and misinformation.[3]

Recommendation 4: The government should provide the ACMA with reserve powers to register
industry codes, enforce industry code compliance, and make standards relating to the activities of
digital platforms’ corporations. These powers would provide a mechanism for further intervention if
code administration arrangements prove inadequate, or the voluntary industry code fails.[ 4]

We are pleased to see that these recommendations have been included in the draft Bill.[5]

## Draft Bill Comments

In principle ACCAN does not have any significant concerns with the draft Bill. ACCAN supports the
intent of the Bill to allow the ACMA and DIGI to ensure continuous improvement to the voluntary
code and only implement the ACMA’s powers should the voluntary code fail to produce the required
protections. As such, ACCAN supports the Bill’s inclusion of the proposed reserve powers to:

  - Enable the ACMA to gather information from or require digital platform providers to keep
certain records about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation.

  - Enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to
combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could
register and enforce.

  - Allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation),
should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and
disinformation on digital platforms.

We are pleased to see that the registered code and standard making procedure requires a broad and
open consultation process with the requirement that at least one consumer organisation has been
consulted.

However, we do believe that there is scope to clarify the process of code deregistration.

The Bill would benefit from the inclusion of an explanation of when and under what circumstances
codes are to be de-registered. Should a code be considered for de-registration without it being
superseded by an updated code or standard, ACCAN recommends that a formalised public
consultation be undertaken with adequate time allocated for community responses. This
consultation process needs to outline the reasons the code is being considered for de-registration
and include meaningful consultation with all interested stakeholders, including at least one relevant
consumer representative organisation.
