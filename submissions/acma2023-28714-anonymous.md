Submission regarding the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

This Bill should not be enacted at all.

I do not agree that misinformation and disinformation is a major issue worldwide, or at all. I do not
agree with the premise that the spread of false, misleading and deceptive information (or any
information) has resulted in harms or undermined democratic institutions.

Information in and of itself cannot do anything. People do things. If people choose to use
information to harm others then there should be repercussions. We have laws to handle these
things. We do not need this one.

Not only do we not need this Act, it violates an individualâ€™s right to free speech.

I strongly oppose the enactment of this Bill in any way, shape or form.
