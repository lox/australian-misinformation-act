In the tapestry of a democratic society, the government must never be granted the

authority to dictate what is considered truth or to muzzle the voices of its citizens. Central

to the essence of a democratic ethos is the preservation of the freedom to express a

spectrum of ideas and viewpoints. The bedrock of our society rests upon free speech.

Free speech, an essential attribute of a free society, provides a platform where the populace

can engage in discourse that spans the spectrum of novel and established ideas. This

discourse nourishes the fertile soil from which diversity and vitality flourish in our society.

To even entertain the notion of stifling this vibrant exchange of ideas is an affront to the

very values that underpin a democratic nation.

The existence of a Bill contemplating such restrictions is an alarming signpost. The fact that

it has advanced to the draft stage is deeply disconcerting, as it calls into question the

resilience of the democratic framework that should protect the individual rights and

freedoms we hold dear.

With the gravity that this issue carries, I fervently call upon all those who hold sway over the

decision-making process. It is my plea that this Bill, contrary to the values of a free society,

be expunged from consideration. The trajectory it follows should be one that leads to its

unequivocal rejection. The erosion of individual rights is incompatible with the principles

that safeguard the vitality of our nation. Let those in power choose to tear up this Bill and

thus stand as defenders of liberty and champions of a thriving, democratic society.
