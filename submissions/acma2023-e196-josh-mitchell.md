chosen to send an email with my concerns.
I disagree with this proposed bill. The tyrannical overreach of government is what poses a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as to our democracy, society, and economy.
As we have seen previously information that has been deemed disinformation or misinformation has become debatable or in fact
truth. Society needs to be able to hear all views and determine for themselves what to be truth or disinformation. We don't need
you in every facet of our lives leading us in a direction you choose, we are free to choose our own path and our own beliefs. As it
stands most of the disinformation or misinformation is coming from the government or other regulatory agencies. This is just
another attempt to silence those that are trying to spread awareness and truths of what the 'elected', and unelected bureaucrats
are trying to impose on the people. Maybe there should be a royal commission into the dealings of covid 19 etc to determine
what the facts are. Until this happens who determines what is disinformation or truth. I and a lot of others do not believe a word
that comes from most of the government and regulatory officials, so have little faith that they are qualified to do so.

Start serving the people as your elected to do rather self-serving and imposing your will upon us.
