I do not consent or favour the idea of ACMA being the ones to decide on what
misinformation and disinformation is. ACMA is very conflicted in its role to do that, since its
funding source determines where its loyalties lie, and as such cannot be trusted in anyway
shape or form to take on this role in any genuine manner. The notion that the government
and mainstream news media are exempt from scrutiny in their broadcasts etc. proves the
corruption of the government in thinking it can never do or say anything incorrect and
harmfully so. The last three and a half years have proven how deceptive and misleading
both the government and mainstream news media they are and they both deserve the
ultimate accountability for the harms they both have inflicted on our society through their
false, misleading and manipulative messaging.

Please stop treating Australians like we are idiots. It's hard work trying to undo all the
damage that the government and news media has done to our society for so many decades.
This bill and anything that mimics it should be rejected in every way, and any further
attempts to censor dissenting views from government propaganda and rhetoric is a danger
to our democratic society. If ACMA can't do its job without bias, fear or favour then by
definition it cannot serve the public, it only pretends to do so.
