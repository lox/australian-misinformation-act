# NO, I THINK NOT. 

## Disclaimer, I am not a Line or media follower. 

BUT, looking back since the emergency powers were introduced here, and round the world,
for Cov19, it been show now, that all authorities, here, as round the world have made a lot
of wrong decisions, and restriction, not only on free speech, BUT on people that should had
some INPUT or listen to, on a lot that was happening at the time.

Instead, DECISIONS were made by people that did not have absolute KNOW HOW on the
subject at the time.

NOW, all come to shown that most of them, (that were call Names) and what they were
saying at the time, IF NOT ALL, MOST were in FACT CORRECT FACTS.

And weren't we, Australian's and the world divided on what was claimed misinformation as
some claimed, and some are still do.

So, giving all that power to one body with so heavy penalties, as has shown with other
body’s, will not be good, after all an opinion statement shouldn't be taken FACT, and
shouldn't be determent as MISINFORMATION by one body or one person.

Look what’s happening now on the Government’s VOICE, aren’t we divided again?

And I am not looking or listen on an average person’s opinion, we have Constitution experts,
SOLICITORS, SCOLERS, and MP’ S, on both sides claim the opinions is the correct one.

EVEN APORIGINAL’ themselves are Divided.

So why create such body?

It looks like the Government of the DAY, like to determent what is Misinformation, MAYBE,
if they do not like what it tells? Or is on the opposite side of the discussion? Argument? And
we should take their word, that is Misinformation, and should be taken down.

And Last, unless you have your head buried in the BONDI sand, we all heard what happen
Over the last two Years in the US, from FBI, and DOJ, and all the powerful people there,
about what they claim was

>MISIINFORMATION<

So, I hope I made my point, it shouldn’t be done, let Discussions sort it self out.
