Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023

All Australians deserve freedom of speech even if it may be inconvenient or uncomfortable
for some.

With freedom of speech comes the ability for many opinions to be given and discussed so
that people can make informed decisions for themselves.

Freedom of speech in Australia in the last few years has been severely affected by
censorship and many Australians are blindly unaware of the truth of many matters because
of the suppression of alternative points of view that are backed by verifiable facts. The
success of current laws in restricting information contrary to the government narrative
means that even more draconian legislation such as this Bill is not necessary.

This Bill will severely limit freedom of speech even more than is happening now and most
worrying to me is the lack of detail as to who will determine what the truth is. Far more
detail is required as to how the legislation will be enacted and there should be a process for
Australians to be able to question the resulting “truths”.

Are these “truths” to be enshrined in a document so that Australians know that any
information coming from governments and media sources are conforming to that narrative
and why?

I believe this Bill is a further erosion of my human rights and I fear for the future of
Australian society if Freedom of Speech is to become Control of Speech by authorities not
outlined in this legislation.
