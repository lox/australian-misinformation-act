Thank you for taking the fime to read this submission.

The bill of misinformafion / disinformafion is very concerning and I and my family members strongly
oppose this.

Who determines what is misinformafion? The key board of ACMA is only 6 individuals?

We all are supposed to be in a free democracy, the people can choose for ourselves, with our own
mind what informafion we want to accept as true or false. The government does not have the right to
choose for US.

We all have different belief systems. What I classify is true may be completely differently too what
ACMA determines as true.

I do not believe in any form of hatred or harming of people’s rights; however, freedom of speech is
vital for a democracy.

The voice wants to hear indigenous peoples voice, but what about the rest of society? One cultural
race does not make up all of Australia, we live in a mulficultural society, we should be one people, with
all equal rights.

Social media plafforms have already censored people’s voices, even when scienfists and proven facts
were given, the government censored it because it did not agree with the government’s narrafive.
Media stafions were silenced and sfill are, and this is already very concerning.

Australia is sfill pushing and advocafing for false science to be pushed, with the TGA sfill approving fake
vaccines to be safe and effecfive and mask wearing which science tells do not work. The government’s
responsibility was to read the research paper / facts from Moderna, Pitzer as they did not state that
these fake vaccines would stop transmission or protect you from gefting covid.

In this bill the government is exempt from these rules of misinformafion? Please explain how this is
fair?

This is clearly a dictatorship; freedom of speech is part of being in a supposed free society. Heavy levels
of control and censorship already exist, mandates sfill occurring? Freedom of people’s bodily
autonomy does not exist.

Fines will be issued if people disagree with government?

What I deem as factual and science like issues around climate change, vaccines, gender, which can be
shown with evidence-based informafion on biology and based on scienfists, this research and death
rates from vaccine injuries is silenced? So, the facts I and others can provide will be shut down? And
will not be heard, only what the government wants?

People are allowed to disagree in respecfful manners. To have free open dialogue, isn’t this what the
government wants for the VOICE referendum?

Please stand for ALL Australian and under natural law, common law of human rights of freedom of
speech.

Allow people to view and share their opinions and facts in a fair democracy.

I advocate for our future generafions. Think of our children and our own right to have a voice, not just
one culture which will separate us. Let us be one Australian people to unite us not divide us.

The covid narrafive of safe and effecfive was a lie. Government yearly say SORRY to one culture as
reconciliafion which is lovely, however what about the mandates, lockdowns, banning true safe and
effecfive early treatment drugs and protocols for covid people? But this was not allowed. Change the
path, the course of this country in posifive ways please.
