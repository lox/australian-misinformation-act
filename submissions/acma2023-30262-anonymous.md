 Submission on the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I am writing this submission as a private citizen.

I want to express my utter disgust at what this legislative amendment entails, this is
wrong in its very foundation.

Government should not be in the business of censoring the media, or private individuals,
which is what this amounts to.

The dishonest invitation to the public to believe that you are protecting the public's right
to free speech, when you write in your guidance:

"The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed
from digital platform services.‚Äù is a disgrace, because it doesn't make any difference
whether ACMA does it or outsources it via codes of practise to Big Tech platforms.

All this does is make it dishonestly appear as though the censorship is coming from
the platform instead of its real source, the ACMA, which has made itself
unaccountable even to the public's elected representatives in the legislation: at 64
**Digital Platforms Rules**
the proposed legislation states:
(1) The ACMA may, by legislative instrument, make rules (the digital platform rules)
prescribing matters:
(a) required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed by the 11 digital platform rules;
or (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this
Schedule.

That means this unelected bureaucracy, ACMA has now got the power to make its own
laws.

A small group of people should not get to decide whether something is true or not,
and silence the voices of people who dissent.

Half the time what is "true" turns out to be wrong later.

Nobody should have the right to silence the voice of private individuals.

It frightens me that a government body can make it so the public at large can't see or
share opinions of which the government doesn't approve.

This will remove the ability of the public at large to have their say on any social media
platform if their view is contrary to that of the powers that be.

This is nothing more than tyranny and totalitarianism. How can you call yourselves a
democratic government when you are silencing and gagging anyone who has a valid or
different viewpoint.

For example Senator Gerard Rennick tried to share the story of Faith Ranson, a
Tasmanian teenager who was injured by the covid mRNA gene-vaccines, and it was
censored by Facebook for being "against community standards" and nobody could see
when it was re-posted.

I absolutely and categorically reject your proposed legislation in its entirety.

This concludes my submission.
