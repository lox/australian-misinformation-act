Dear Reviewing Members:

I would like to express my apprecia<on for the opportunity to provide feedback on the dra?
of the Communica<ons Legisla<on Amendment (CombaDng Misinforma<on and
Disinforma<on) Bill 2023.

While I support the need for such a Bill, the current dra? should not be passed for the
following reasons:

1. The Bill should not place regulatory powers solely in the hands of the ACMA to hold

digital plaOorms to account. In addi<on, the Bill will empower the ACMA to compel
digital plaOorms to provide informa<on and evidence about misinforma<on and
disinforma<on on organisa<ons or individuals. This is a breach of freedom of speech
and privacy.

2. The Bill violates Australia’s commitment to human rights under Ar<cle 19 of the

Universal Declara<on of Human Rights (UDHR) which was ra<fied by Australia. The
Ar<cle includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive
and impact informa<on and ideas through any media and regardless of fron<ers.

3. The Bill lacks a holis<c approach to the management of misinforma<on and

disinforma<on on digital plaOorms. The Australian Human Rights Commission
submission to the Senate Select CommiVee on Foreign Interference through Social
Media has such a holis<c approach.

a. A submission by the Australian Human Rights Commission dated 16 February

2023 “Inquiry into the risk posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign
interference through social media” was made to the Senate Select CommiVee
on Foreign Interference through Social Media.

b. In the submission, a wider range of recommenda<ons were made.

Highligh<ng some of the recommenda<ons are:

i. The Australian Government establishing a permanent “whole-of
government” taskforce dedicated to preven<ng and comba<ng cybermanipula<on in Australia.

ii. Addressing and proposing recommenda<on to the risks to privacy

through digital literacy and transparent frameworks that apply to all
social media and internet companies.

iii. Transparency of censorship where social media plaOorms must

publicly disclose the content they have censor and making it an
offence to censor content whether that has not publicly disclosed to
the users.

The Bill in its current dra? requires further consulta<on and review before it is ready to be
considered for legisla<on. The greatest danger to this Bill is that it lacks sufficient safeguards
and is a provision for organisa<ons and interest-groups including the Government to control
and manage the percep<on of the General Public on issues through censorship.

Regards,
Lay Meng
