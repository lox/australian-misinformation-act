I have grave concerns for the future of our country if free speech and discussion is throttled. We all saw
how the Covid misinformation/disinformation lockdown failed so dismally, promoting only one
viewpoint, which turned out to be the voice of money and power, not the voice of health and reason.
Who is to say what is mis/disinformation? Once upon the earth was flat. Once upon a time the sun
revolved around the earth. Both points that were ferociously upheld and fought for - killed for! - by the
leaders of their times, and both proved to be very wrong. Obviously, there are limits to HOW free
speech should be - nobody has the right to threaten another individual or group. But open and frank
discussions among adults on ALL topics should be encouraged in any free and democratic country. We
really don't need a watchdog telling us what to think.
