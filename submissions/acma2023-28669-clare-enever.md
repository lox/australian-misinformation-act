To whom it may concern,

I am against the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I am concerned that this bill will give a small group of people the power to decide what is
information vs disinformation. I am concerned that this bill will reduce freedom of speech. I am
concerned that this bill will reduce ability for good debate as both sides may not have the same
opportunity to share information. Social media is our modern day town square, please allow us to
speak freely.

Please scrap this bill.

I consent to having this submission be made public.

Kind Regards

Clare Enever
