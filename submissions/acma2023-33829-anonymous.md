No laws can be made with regard to freedom of speech in accordance with the Commonwealth
Constitution and the Bill of Human Rights.

This Bill is of a political nature by the theme of it, and seems to be proposed to make laws over the
people which it cannot do. Laws can only be made for the people and not over them.

Laws cannot be made over one class of people and not another ie. Everyday people under one law,
the politicians under another and the press under another. Everyone is equal under the law.

There is no such thing as misinformation or disinformation and these are just made up words. There
is truth and lies and to be able to come to a conclusion of which is which, debate from all areas on all
subjects must be free to discern the outcome. What is a lie one day may become truth on another
day and vice versa.

At this point in time, the most untrustworthy information is coming from the politicians and the
press and this has borne out time and time again of recent times. As such, there is no trusthworthy
person or entity in this country that has the knowledge, right or the knowhow to even think about
discerning what is true or not. People can decide for themselves as they have always done.

We already have laws in place for defamatory speech etc. and as such this Bill is irrelevant.

This Bill is discriminatory and as such is unlawful. FULL STOP.
