### Public Submission: The Communications Legislation

#### Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Cth)

Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport,
Regional Development, Communications and the Arts regarding the _Communications_ _Legislation_
_Amendment_ _(Combating_ _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023_ _(Cth)_

I oppose the passage of this bill for the following reasons:

The federal government has declared that it will **trample** **over** **freedom** **of** **speech** **by** **giving** **a**
**government** **agency** **(ACMA)** **new** **powers** **to** **combat** **what** **it** **deems** **as** **‘misinformation’** **and**
**‘disinformation’** **online.**

The question is who gets to determine what is misinformation or disinformation and what is the
truth?

The past few years have shown us that many things declared as “fake news” one day end up
being proven truthful several months down the track.

The Albanese Labor Government haven’t said how they will determine what they believe to be
false or not, but they have said that they will target anything that they think is:

##### • hateful against the LGBTIQ community;

 • disruptive to society;

 • harmful to democracy;

 • harmful to the environment; or

 • harmful to the economy.

All of this is extremely subjective and open to someone’s interpretation.

The proposed law will cover social media platforms, search engines, news aggregators, web
forums, video platforms like YouTube and podcasting platforms. Just about everything on the
internet is in the firing line of this new Australian 'Ministry of Truth'!

Please protect our hard fought for freedoms and particularly our freedom of speech in Australia.
