**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Exposure**
**Draft Bill)**

A New Approach (ANA) welcomes this opportunity to comment on the Exposure Draft Bill to enhance the powers of
the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). ANA recognises the Australian Government’s efforts
to combat misinformation (including disinformation), such as the Exposure Draft Bill, the Government’s request for
the DIGI voluntary code and the establishment of the Strengthening Democracy Taskforce. ANA also recognises the
efforts of digital platforms, including under the voluntary code.

We are pleased to provide comments on the Exposure Draft Bill. ANA’s research demonstrates freedom of expression
is important to middle Australians, who are grateful for this freedom and consider it an important democratic value.[1]
While freedom of expression is an important right, ANA also recognises that no right is absolute. ANA recognises
striking the right balance between combating misinformation and the right to freedom of expression (as well as
other rights) is a necessary and delicate exercise.

ANA encourages the Department to continue working with the Department of Industry, Science and Resources
(DISR) and other agencies on governance of artificial intelligence (AI), which can generate, spread and combat
misinformation. ANA believes that with the right governance and collaboration, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a
part of Australia reaching its full potential as a cultural powerhouse. No matter the cultural form, content platform
or community, the opportunities and risks of AI are real. AI has the potential to affect incentives to create as well as
cultural and social inclusion and freedom of expression in arts, culture and creativity. This is true of AI-generated
deepfakes, and many applications of AI.

Please find our detailed comments on the Exposure Draft Bill below. In our role as a philanthropically funded,
independent think tank, ANA is ready to provide further information about the recommendations outlined in this
submission and would welcome the opportunity to discuss them.

Warm regards,

Kate Fielding, CEO, A New Approach (ANA)

### Detailed comments on exposure draft bill

##### Graduated application of ACMA powers (Part 3 of Schedule 9)

ANA welcomes the graduated application of ACMA powers that would be established by the Exposure Draft Bill,
which has the potential to be part of a proportionate, risk-based approach. ANA encourages the Department to
continue working with DISR, the ACMA and other agencies involved in AI governance to work towards a cohesive
risk-based approach. AI can be applied to generate, spread and combat misinformation. To respond systematically
to AI risks, including those relating to misinformation, ANA supports a risk-based approach to AI governance. See
our submission to the DISR for details.[2] ANA understands, at a high level, the graduated application of ACMA powers
would work as follows:

**The DIGI voluntary** **Information** **Misinformation** **Misinformation**
**code (or any future** **gathering rules** **codes (Division** **standards (Division**
**voluntary code)** **(Division 3)*** **4)*** **5)***

**Applies to which** Providers that are Any providers Any providers Any providers
**digital platform** signatories ACMA chooses ACMA chooses ACMA chooses
**providers?**

**Who chooses** Providers that are ACMA Providers that are ACMA
**rules?** signatories signatories

**Who enforces** Providers that are ACMA ACMA ACMA
**rules?** signatories

*For digital platform services other than those excluded by Clause 6.

##### Information gathering rules (Division 3)

ANA welcomes these rules, which provide transparency and accountability on the effectiveness of platform efforts to
combat misinformation. This could form part of a risk-based approach to AI governance. For example, the proposed
EU AI Act includes transparency requirements as part of its risk-based approach.[3]

As digital platform providers and the ACMA continue to address misinformation, ANA would welcome transparency
on the use of AI in content, which helps to mitigate misinformation risks while separating creators from content they
did not generate. For example, the European Union Digital Services Act suggests ‘prominent markings’ for deepfakes
as a one mitigation of AI risks.[4] Likewise, the United States has obtained a pledge from major AI companies to
watermark AI-generated content.[5]

|Col1|The DIGI voluntary code (or any future voluntary code)|Information gathering rules (Division 3)*|Misinformation codes (Division 4)*|Misinformation standards (Division 5)*|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Applies to which digital platform providers?|Providers that are signatories|Any providers ACMA chooses|Any providers ACMA chooses|Any providers ACMA chooses|
|Who chooses rules?|Providers that are signatories|ACMA|Providers that are signatories|ACMA|
|Who enforces rules?|Providers that are signatories|ACMA|ACMA|ACMA|

##### Excluded content for misinformation purposes (Clause 2)

ANA welcomes protection of the right to freedom of expression while empowering the ACMA to regulate efforts to
combat misinformation. Consistent with the view of the Australian Law Reform Commission, ANA considers the right
to freedom of expression is essential to arts and culture, but not absolute.[6]

Generally, ANA supports carving out content for purposes such as ‘satire’, ‘parody’, ‘professional news content’ and
‘educational content’ from the scope of ‘misinformation’.[7] ANA welcomes the carveout for ‘entertainment, parody
or satire’ being subject to a ‘good faith’ requirement.[8] ANA suggests this carveout only applies where the content
is ‘produced and disseminated in good faith’, not where content is ‘produced in good faith’. This is because even
content produced in good faith for ‘entertainment, parody or satire’ could be disseminated by another person with
the intent and effect to misinform.[9]

##### Matters relevant to serious harm for misinformation and disinformation purposes (Clause 7)

ANA welcomes a non-exhaustive list of matters relevant to determining any link between provision of content and
‘serious harm’, to help enable proportionate regulation.

ANA notes ‘the author of the information’ is on this list, which also includes ‘any other relevant matter’. ANA suggests
also including ‘the disseminator of the information’ on the list. This would also avoid the perception of singling out
creators of cultural content.[10]

6 The ALRC has said ‘it is widely recognised that freedom of speech is not absolute’. Australian Law Reform Commission.
[“Traditional Rights and Freedoms— Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws,” 2015. https://www.alrc.gov.au/wp-content/up-](https://www.alrc.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/alrc_129_final_report_.pdf)

7 ANA notes the EU voluntary code carves out a similar range of content from the scope of ‘disinformation’. European
Commission. “2022 Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation | Shaping Europe’s Digital Future.” Shaping Europe’s digital
[future, June 16, 2022. https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/2022-strengthened-code-practice-disinformation.](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/2022-strengthened-code-practice-disinformation.)

8 In particular, there is a risk that ‘entertainment’ could be overly broad without an effective ‘good faith’ requirement.
The term ‘entertainment’ is used by at least one digital platform provider under the DIGI voluntary code to describe all content on
that platform. ‘TikTok is first and foremost an entertainment platform… that brings people together over creative and entertaining
content’. TikTok Australia. “Submission to Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media.” Department of the
[Senate, March 1, 2023. https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Interference_Social_Me-](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Interference_Social_Media/ForeignInterference47/Public_Hearings)
[dia/ForeignInterference47/Public_Hearings](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Interference_Social_Media/ForeignInterference47/Public_Hearings)

9 ANA understands this is the reason for the DIGI voluntary code providing that otherwise excluded content may be
‘disinformation’ when propagated by ‘inauthentic behaviours’. Digital Industry Group Inc. “Australian Code of Practice on Disin[formation and Misinformation,” December 22, 2022. https://digi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Australian-Code-of-Prac-](https://digi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Australian-Code-of-Practice-on-Disinformation-and-Misinformation-FINAL-_-December-22-2022.docx.pdf)
