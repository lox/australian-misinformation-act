# Submission to ACMA inquiry regarding mis and dis-information on media platforms.

It Is with a sense of disheartenment and dis-ease that I write this submission regarding the
government’s flawed thinking in wanting to control all access to information that our current
digital technology gives us access to.

All our governments in Australia have been elected on the principles of democracy.
Unfortunately, from the 1970s there has been a greater turn away from governing for the
people, by the people and of the people. We have now reached the point where our
elected leaders are pseudo dictators, feeling they have the power to make decisions that
can affect large numbers without consultation or debate. It is here that the old saying that
“Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely” holds much truth.

Since the “pandemic” in 2020 many leaders have discovered that the true power of holding
the populace in fear has allowed them greater freedoms to act corruptly by minimising
activities that are an integral part of freedom for its supposedly sovereign citizens. It was
very evident then that all media sprouted the “government line”. Especially the ABC who
should hold all encompassing views on the information given, was so politically correct and
they remain that way, offering nothing divergent from the government story.

Allowing the general media of newspapers and TV to have freedom to display repeated
stories that give the average non discerning viewer/reader a great deal of fear that
reinforces that their world is a dangerous place that requires paternalistic government
measures to keep them safe is dangerous and, I believe, treacherous.

Then determining that individuals who are more discerning and want to know more of what
is really going on besides that which is made made openly to the general public are to be
restricted from accessing what is a basic freedom to information from whatever source
they choose. Appreciating there are those individuals who are mentally not as stable who
may access information that is a direct threat to the safety of others but that is still no
reason to stop access to information for all.

The important thing is appropriate education. Something again our political leaders have
let down successive generations due to maintaining a schooling system that is an
anachronism in this fast changing digital environment we all now experience. The children
are still being taught how to be prepared for life as lived in the 1950s and not our current
environment of rapid changes. They are not taught by parents, society or schools about
learning the value of self awareness, self discipline, self determination and discernment.
They are then exposed to the insane risks of their chosen social media platforms that can

do so much emotional and mental damage or else they lose their youth to living in a virtual
world of violent digital games.

These are not reasons to deny access to information that does not fit the government
agenda of the day. Freedom of speech and free access to whatever information one
wishes to seek has been a fundamental principle to a sovereign nation. It must remain
that way.
