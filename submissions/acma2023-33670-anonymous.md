## Submission to the
 Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts

 Regarding: Feedback on Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 Dear Sir/Madam,

### I write in response to the ACMAâ€™s request for feedback on the
## proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

### I absolutely oppose any form of censorship in Australia and DO
## NOT support this legislation or Bill in any way, shape or form.

### I vehemently oppose any laws which would empower ACMA or
## any other Australian body to restrict in any way our right to communicate freely and openly on any issue whatsoever.

 One of the main reasons for my opposition to this proposed Bill
### is because I believe that any Government or Government agency
## that is legislated to be the centralised authority to determine what
### is true or false, then inevitably tends to become more of a
## dictatorship. This proposed Bill should be very concerning for our Democracy.

 In our free and healthy democratic society WE MUST have the freedom to have open and frank discussion, opinion and expression in any media that is available even if that opinion does not agree with someone else and even if the whole discussion does not have absolute facts. These proposed amendments are truly censorious and censorship stifles robust


-----

## discussion and robust discussion is the best way for individuals to determine what is true or false. Robust discussion is also the pathway to moving ourselves forward as a Democratic Nation whereas this proposed Bill would be taking us backwards.

 The best solution for disinformation/misinformation is free and open debate and not stifling freedom of speech and expression.

 Real science and progress welcomes questions and criticisms because that is how it becomes stronger. Real critical thought is also fostered by free exchange of questions and challenges.

### I am vigorously opposed to this proposed Bill.

## Thank you for considering my feedback. I trust that you will carefully examine the concerns raised by me and withdraw this proposed Bill.

 Yours sincerely,
