 Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications

 Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)

# "Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation" Bill 2023:
 Safeguarding Democratic Principles

## Introduction

The proposed "Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation" Bill 2023 by the Australian Government
presents itself as a measure to protect citizens from the perils of online misinformation and
disinformation. Yet, a closer examination of its provisions brings to light substantial concerns regarding
governmental overreach, potential infringements upon freedom of expression and speech – pivotal
pillars of democracy – and the looming specter of censorship. The bill's implications for these core
democratic principles necessitate meticulous scrutiny and thorough public discourse.

## The Crucial Role of Online Platforms

In today's digital age, the internet, particularly social media platforms, has become the contemporary
equivalent of a public square. Within these platforms, individuals share ideas, information, and opinions,
which makes preserving the freedom to express and discuss viewpoints an imperative aspect of a
thriving democracy. As the bill beckons us to ponder the role of government in determining the contours
of misinformation and disinformation, it concurrently obliges us to assess the appropriateness of
governmental intervention in shaping citizens' online expression.

**Balancing Government Intervention and Civil Liberties**

Central to the debate is the pivotal question: Should the Australian government, facilitated by the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and digital platforms, serve as the ultimate
arbiters of truth? This inquiry leads us to contemplate the notion of self-determination, as the bill
implicitly challenges citizens' capacity to form their own independent judgments, insinuating that they
necessitate guidance from governmental entities, experts, and mainstream media. This dynamic raises
significant apprehensions regarding the potential attenuation of individual autonomy and the stifling of a
rich spectrum of perspectives.

## Contextualizing the Historical Precedence

Though the current bill is novel, its sentiment has historical antecedents, often introduced into the
parliamentary domain with limited success. The 2012 Finkelstein Report, a pertinent precedent, shed
light on the doubt surrounding citizens' critical reasoning abilities and their capability to evaluate
information autonomously. Despite the resistance such notions faced, the proposed bill signifies the
persistence of patronizing convictions, suggesting that citizens require governmental bodies, experts,
and mainstream media to prescribe truth and guide their cognitive processes.

## The Spectrum of Implications for Democracy

The implications of this proposed legislation are both comprehensive and profound:

1. Freedom of Expression and Speech: The bill holds the potential to impinge upon these foundational
rights, empowering government and ACMA to monitor, track, and discern misinformation and
disinformation. This might lead to excessive censorship and a quelling of dissenting voices, thereby
undermining the very essence of democracy.

2. Preserving Open Discourse: In its endeavor to counteract misinformation, the bill might inadvertently
stifle open debate and the free exchange of ideas. An authentic democracy thrives upon diverse
viewpoints and encourages the propagation of myriad opinions, nurturing a climate for well-informed
decisions.

3. A Dichotomy of Society: By exempting government bodies, mainstream media, and academia from its
purview, the bill establishes a dichotomy between the "authorized" entities and the rest. This bifurcation

raises concerns about unequal treatment, where those vested with rule-making powers remain immune
from the regulations they prescribe.

4. Human Rights Ramifications: Eminent legal experts opine that the bill violates human rights,
especially the rights to freedom of speech, self-determination, and freedom of thought. The bill's
nebulous definitions and subjectivity in enforcement could precipitate legal battles, favoring the
influential at the expense of the common citizen.

## Unintended Ramifications

While the bill strives to counteract misinformation and disinformation, it inadvertently might stymie
authentic discussions. The distinction between misinformation and disinformation, hinging on the
element of intent, presents a subjectivity that might result in the arbitrary removal of content.
Furthermore, the bill's emphasis on "harm" and "serious harm" prompts scrutiny into its potential
impact on discussions related to health, the environment, and social issues.

## Proposals for Augmentation

To address the concerns raised by the bill, a spectrum of legal experts and advocacy groups recommend
several key enhancements:

1. Harmonization with Human Rights: The bill must align with Australia's international human rights
obligations, with heightened safeguards for free expression, self-determination, and freedom of thought.

2. Incorporation of Guiding Principles: The bill should integrate guiding principles underscoring the
significance of freedom of speech and expression. ACMA's decisions should be compelled to
acknowledge and respect these rights.

3. Objective Definition Refinement: The definitions of "misinformation" and "disinformation" should be
reframed to encompass content constituting a criminal offense, shifting focus from subjective
assessments of truth.

4. Checks and Balances Implementation: Introduce mechanisms of external and independent oversight
over ACMA decisions to ensure transparency and accountability.

5. Upholding Privacy: Enforce a clause safeguarding compliance with privacy legislation during
information provision.

## Concluding Reflections

The proposed "Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation" Bill 2023 holds profound implications for
democratic ideals, freedom of expression, and freedom of speech. While its intentions to counteract
online harm are commendable, its latent potential for censorship, stifling of dissenting voices, and
erosion of democratic values is deeply concerning. The vague definitions, subjective enforcement, and
the potential bifurcation of society demand a deliberate public discourse and a collaborative endeavor to
strike a delicate equilibrium between citizen protection and the preservation of democratic ethos. The
onus is upon the citizenry to engage in informed, reasoned discussions and to advocate fervently for the
safeguarding of essential rights. The outcome of this discourse will significantly shape the trajectory of
Australia's digital landscape and the bedrock of its democracy.

In closing, we oppose any legislation which would empower ACMA or any other Australian body to
restrict in any way, our right to communicate freely and openly on any issue.
