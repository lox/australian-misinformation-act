Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

(the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

_Disinformation) Bill 2023)_

I am distressed to see how far down the path to tyranny this government and the

previous government has taken Australia.

The last three years have demonstrated clearly that our Constitutionally-guaranteed

rights to breathe freely, choose what we will and will not allow in our bodies and

even our ability to educate our children or ourselves and be able to continue working

at our careers has been restricted.

Now, the Commonwealth wants to take things a step further and determine what we

can and cannot say or even think by holding the social media platforms accountable

for ‘allowing’ us to have freedom of political speech or even speech on any topic

Government power must really be tenuous if the only way it can hold onto it is by

suppressing any and all debate.

Our media companies are owned by foreign actors who only allow very limited

information to be distributed to the Australian people. Much of this is mis
information and dis-information. However the proposed laws will exempt these

foreign corporations from the legislation. It will also exempt government from the

law.

The other side of many issues is only available on social media and in the alternative

broadcast media. This might not pose a problem for the authorities if it weren’t for the

fact that more and more people were ignoring the mainstream and availing themselves

of the data being reported by non-Government-approved sources.

Australia has already seen the shocking ramifications of people being arrested for

unpublished thoughts and publishing calls to legally and peacefully protest against

corrupt and authoritarian state regimes. Victoria being a case in point.

Australia already has laws in place to protect people from hate speech or

threats. These laws are effective and used regularly to protect minorities and

vulnerable people.

ACMA should not be the arbiter of what is mis or dis-information.

The answer to scientific or political controversies isn’t more censorship – it’s more

debate. Even before this legislation was proposed, I was the victim of a coordinated

campaign of censorship including having my Facebook account suspended without

reasonable explanation.

So I absolutely oppose any laws which would empower ACMA or any other

Australian body to restrict in any way my right to legally communicate freely and

openly on any issue whatsoever.

Kind regards,
