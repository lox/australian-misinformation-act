## My submission on the New ACMA powers to combat
# misinformation and disinformation

Hello,

I’m sending this submission by email because my submission via your site listed that I had 2 errors. Opinions don’t have
errors, so some anal-retentive individual created that inclusion in your site. Time for editing at your end.

As a -year-old man, who as a 24-year-old after completion of my first degree at Sydney Uni, knew how to avoid national
service in the Vietnam War (and typical of governments, that war was based on a lie, on this occasion by Jim Morrison of the
Doors' father, an admiral in the US fleet off North Vietnam) by failing the medical test; who has watched the government of
the day here in Australia begin to mandate vaccinations for pre-school children (and I have five) and who watched the soaring
incidence of autism; who watched the current and previous State and Federal Governments institute medical fascism through
the COVID-shots and maim and murder tens of thousands of Australian citizens, and still keep silent on this mass crime; as a
lecturer of medical herbalism for over 35 years at 12 colleges of natural therapies around Australia, who has watched the
government-approved treatments which maim and kill many citizens...and you want me to trust YOU? The leading cause of
death in Australia are doctors, and you approve everything they do. Sorry, I don't trust any government of any nation. And
certainly not your one with its propaganda and coverups. Delete this proposed legislation asap. And by the way, I did my
Master of Arts in Clinical and Social Psychology....we learned how the Nazis could change the free-thinking German people
under the Weimar Republic until 1933, and lead the nation to create the Holocaust. Time to start thinking as individuals, not
as government employees and propagandists. And guess what? This is my opinion…and only people with low IQs would
suggest an opinion, a point-of view, can be considered disinformation or misinformation. The Nazis would be proud of you.

Cheers, Jesse
