My feed back will begin with a quote from your very own website, in regards to this very
subject:"Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians,
as well as to our democracy, society and economy." Who gets to decide what is or isn't
mis/disinformation? I will reference to mainly covid pandemic situations as this for me has been an
eye opener. People in control are not always correct. People in control can (and do) LIE. People in
control can and do become corrupt. Not all, but some. Money and power seem to be the root of
most evil. Is this statement I have just made mis/disinformation? It is my opinion, an opinion that
has come from observation of events. Corrupt: Gladys Berejelklian and her boyfriend at the time, for
example. Lie: TGA for example (with-holding relevant information that is a duty to share as part of
your role I consider lying- I refer to the death of children after receiving CV-19 injection that has
been brought to light through parliamentary enquiry).

A lot of information now coming to light as broadcast by a certain TV news station is the lies

and corruption involved in the covid farce. FOI requests have discovered messaging between certain
"leading" "scientists" and "doctors" etc etc- that were sceptical of the "wet market" source of covid
and it was a "naturally occurring" virus, yet to the public they made no indication of these
suspicions. They firmly backed the controlled narrative- controlled by who?? Government? Big
Pharma? The W.H.O? TGA? AHPRA? All of the above?? "TRUST THE SCIENCE" they said. No good
when scientists have been bought and paid for, lie, and with-hold pertinent information. This
information has been broadcast publically (that I have seen) only in the last week (3rd week in July
2023)- however if you were one of the many people such as myself who have a need to know whats
actually happening around them, and take the time to investigate from many sources of
independant journalists, I knew this information a year or two ago. And lots more besides that as
well, however I dont want to go on too long. The point is that truth has been suppressed by people
and institutions of "authority".

Anyone with half a brain knows you can find any amount of made-up stories, lies,

propoganda, and other forms of misinformation on the internet. When you see the same facts
emerging from different sources with no connection between the sources, you can assume a higher
probability of truth about the fact in question. IN FACT, the way to discover the truth is to
QUESTION, INVESTIGATE, and APPLY COMMON SENSE, OBSERVATION, and PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
to the situation or event at hand. Its obvious now that the mainstream media news in the majority
are not really credible sources of information, investigative journalists with real integrity are a thing
of the past, and what comes off the telly for the most part is the pushing of a certain narrative
serving either government, or the owners of the media company. Years ago it was illegal for one
media company to have a monopoly ownership of all outlets, yet that has changed- from memory I
think it was about 2014-ish?? when one of our Australian main stations was bought by another. At
the time I thought to myself "hey, isn't that illegal?" but said nothing as most good little Aussies do
and now look where we are. Not anymore. I say as a living Australian man- "STOP THIS BULLSHIT
CENSORSHIP BILL"- it has no place in our "democratic" society.
