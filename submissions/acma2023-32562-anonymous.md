Adoption of this legislation could see the Government define what truth is

and give power to the ACMA and online platforms (META, YouTube, Wiki) to enforce it.

This is wrong, as no Government should be the authority of truth;

limiting the freedom of speech is an attack on the human rights of the citizens.

It simply can be qualified as an Orwellian crusade, Draconian, tyrannical and authoritarian.

The "need" for e-safety will actually shut down privacy.

Citizens would be marginalised and repressed.

It definitely would create a barrier in communication between people,

with the added negative of instilling fear of being dobbed in, or being outcast from the "mainstream"
society.

Hate will be on the streets and in the minds.

The value of free, critical and progressive thinking will be crushed.

The free expression and/or exchange of ideas will cease to exist.

All this will be a camouflage for free thinking and freedom of speech.

This will be another "nany state" measure imposed on the free thinkers

and shows the inability of ACMA to identify the real issues and real perpetrators.

The whole nation will have to suffer because of this inability.

We will soon become a stupid nation following the mainstream so-called "truth",

simply said we'll be asked to act as :stupid monkeys" in the "Banana Republic".

Examples of the qualification of "hateful", "conspiracy" and "dangerous" by the Government are too
many to mention.
