# SUBMISSION: Date: 20[TH] August 2023 MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL
To: https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/new-acma-powers-combatmisinformation-and-disinformation

**I do not consent to this Bill in any form.**
**It is my will that it should be dismissed.**
This Bill is an infringement and limitation on my rights, and those of we the people, to
freedom of expression on social media and other platforms. It is a Bill that promotes
exclusion rather than inclusion and is contrary to free communication in community
that is essential to life and growth of body, mind, soul and spirit.

It is in breach of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ARTICLE 19

_“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right_
_includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive_
_and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of_
_frontiers.”_

The Bill fails to include mechanisms to protect valid expression of opinion and belief
or to ensure that there are clear and defined limits on, and criteria for, suppression of
speech.

It places too much power in the hands of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats
to override the will of the people, and the expression of the people, without
transparency, accountability and the authority under natural law to do so.

It is in breach of the maxim of “equality before the law” in that there is one rule for
government,,,,,,,and another for the people because the government and official
news channels can say what they like and the people do not have the same freedom
of expression.
This opens up the opportunity for government oppression and suppression of the will
of the people.

We have the right to THINK FOR OURSELVES. We are born free with inalienable
human rights and we choose to be FREE to express ourselves. The greatest
promoters of disinformation and misinformation is the Government and the
Mainstream Media.

Furthermore, how does ACMA determine “misinformation” and/or “disinformation”
without first determining “truth”? And by what power, authority, experience and
insight does ACMA have to determine “truth” hence therefore to define
“misinformation” and/or “disinformation”?

**I do not consent to this Bill in any form.**
**It is my will that it should be dismissed.**
