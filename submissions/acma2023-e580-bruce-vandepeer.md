Dear Sir / Madam,

I, Bruce Vandepeer, of present the following submission

regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

There are the well-known maxims: ‘lead by example’ and ‘hold the leaders to a higher standard’
which clearly this Bill has considered current leaders to be above those very important standards for
any and every civilised society.

**Submission discussion**
Firstly, I wish to express my total shock, that in 2023 in Australia there is even a need to be
presenting a submission in relation to this matter; any person even with a modicum of understanding
of history should consider the amendment to the bill is steeped in history and absolutely none of it
positive. I would trust that the authors of this amendment would be aware of George Santayana’s
famous quote ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’[1] Actually check
and read the footnote it will be enlightening but really shouldn’t be if you are serious in your
considerations.

Look at regimes who decided that they had all truth; just two will do the German Democracy in the
1930’s till 1945 and what was the result, many of those who ‘held and enforced the truth’ either
suicided or were tried and imprisoned or executed. Take a second more recent case New Zealand PM
Jacinta Ardern stated that the NZ govt was the ‘sole source of truth’, she has gone but did better than
the Germans she is now on the international stage. Spend a couple of minutes to see how much she
got wrong but under this legislation she would have been exempt anyway, because she was a leader.

The ramifications of this bill can be easily researched and can I suggest identifying sound historical
precedent in a democracy, then look no further than the book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet,
_Spy by Eric Metaxas and Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland_
by Christopher Browning. [yes I have read them both and have the books] Due diligence is important
when introducing legislation and looking at history in a Democracy these would be a good place to
start, before going on to other tyrannical regimes of varying ideologies.

Using your very informative and absolutely frightening Fact sheet I will give just one example [and
there are so many on various topics] of what should be dealt with in accordance with your key points

- albeit you have excluded this from the Act where it applies to the Government.

- Happiness: is the only sanction of life; where happiness fails, existence remains a mad and

lamentable experiment.

- Fanaticism: consists in redoubling your efforts when you have forgotten your aim.

- Progress: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

**Example**

On 21 Feb 21, the then Federal Minister for Health; The Hon Greg Hunt stated inter alia the
following:

“Well, our first goal is protection. And what we see is with both the two initial vaccines, the Pfizer
and the AstraZeneca vaccine, the international evidence is that the safety impact for prevention of
serious illness, hospitalisation, death has been determined to be up to 100 per cent.”

“I would like every Australian to take this up, other than those with a medical reason which would
prevent them, but we recognise that being voluntary is the best way to do that.”

Four very relevant dot points follow from Key points at this link:

 Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of

Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy.

The Bill defines misinformation and disinformation as follows:

1. Misinformation is online content that is false, misleading or deceptive, that is shared or

created without an intent to deceive but can cause and contribute to serious harm.

2. Disinformation is misinformation that is intentionally disseminated with the intent to

deceive or cause serious harm.

3. Serious harm is harm that affects a significant portion of the Australian population,

economy or environment, or undermines the integrity of an Australian democratic
process.

As a result of the Federal Health Minister’s actions (highlighted first statement from the first link
above) the current Government set aside $76.9 million of taxpayers’ (not his) money to compensate
the injured from vaccines for a period of less than a year (more to come?). The minister statement
therefore clearly fits into  dot point above as it provided a threat to ‘safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as our….society and economy.’

The Ministers information was on line – ABC and was clearly ‘false, misleading …..and contribute[d]
to serious harm’ as per dot point 1 above and therefore was misinformation.

The Minister’s department ran an advertising campaign highlighting what he had said regarding the
performance of the vaccines. One of the two vaccines was withdrawn so therefore was
disinformation that was intentionally disseminated as per dot point 2.

The Minister’s actions caused serious harm affecting a significant portion of the population ie those
with serious vaccine injuries and death plus collateral issues to family et al. Compare this to any
other vaccine albeit it clearly was not what the Macquarie dictionary identifies as a vaccine, he
simply called it that. The Minister also stated that the vaccine would be voluntary and that also was
untrue and because it was mandated that ‘undermined the integrity of an Australian Democratic
process’ as per dot point 3.

The most disturbing thing is that because of his position none of this Bill would apply to him. I think
the expression is ‘rules for thee and rules for me’ hardly democratic in any sense.

**Brief comment on issues**
Implementing this amendment would; by definition, implication and history, identify those proposing
and voting for this to be anti-democratic and a disgrace to this nation.

There are simply so many issues. Who will decide what is truth? These people must be subject to the
same rules as the people being charged for misinformation and disinformation, otherwise justice is
not blind. We know that Government, Scientists and the Media have appalling track records on
establishing truth, so who are going to be the arbiters of truth? We know also that Fact Checkers
have failed miserably in spite of financial benefits to them.

If the Politicians represent the people and bureaucrats are known as public servants how on earth
can this amendment be consistent with those two groups fulfilling their roles. So just to clear up the
obvious, electors vote to elect people to represent them because you can’t have a free for all, but it
is in the Constitution. Public servants are there to serve the public I have had disagreements over
that and yet most simply need to check their ‘codes of conduct’ and certainly the ones I have dealt
with are pretty clear.

My Father, long since passed on, would say to me in my youth when heading out of Ararat towards
Melbourne; study hard and be smart but never lose common sense otherwise you will end up in that
house on the hill, up there on the left, perhaps it needs to be reopened.

**Solution**
So, I have a solution to help save our democracy, as previously stated, our politicians are supposed to
be the representatives of the people. Instead of the current procedure so that the concept of leading
by example and holding the leaders to a higher standard are both held up, I propose that you
implement the legislation but for an initial period of five years whilst only have it applying to
Politicians, Bureaucrats, Main Stream Media and Scientists with all the proposed penalties enforced
and then, and only after that, decide by referendum whether or not to go ahead with the
Amendment.

Yours Sincerely,

Bruce F Vandepeer
20 July 2023
