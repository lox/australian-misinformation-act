ABN 43 775 878 315 **SUBMISSION** COUNCIL FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST

**Responding** **to** **_the_** **_invitation,_** **_dated_** **_24_** **_June_** **_2023,_** **_from_** **_Department_** **_of_** **_Infrastructure,_**

**_Disinformation)_** **_Bill_** **_2023_** **_(the_** **_Bill),_** **_the_** **_Council_** **_for_** **_the_** **_National_** **_Interest_** **_states:_**

The Bill does not strike an appropriate balance on a number of issues as follows:

1. Freedom of Speech           - under the legislation the Australian Communications and

Media Authority (ACMA) will be charged with the obligation to ensure that digital

platform providers (DPPs) put in place codes to exclude dissemination of
#### "misinformation" and "disinformation" from their platforms and monitor content,

keep records of and report on the incidence of such posts. They are then required to

censor or remove posts on their platforms that they decide are false, misleading or

deceptive information.

2. ACMA will be responsible for ensuring that DPPs do have the codes of practice in

place to prevent the dissemination of "misinformation" and "disinformation". If a

DPP does not then ACMA has the capacity to impose very large fines so large as to

provide an incentive for the DPP to err on the side of caution when deciding what

may be misleading of deceptive resulting in the probability that perfectly legitimate

views might be censored as misinformation because they are contrary to a popular

view.

3. It is a total rejection of "free speech" to allow organisations such as the DPPs to be

the deciders of what is true or not true and to then censor as misinformation.

4. Although it is claimed that the ACMA would have no role in determining truthfulness

such a claim is unsustainable. The only way the ACMA could properly overview the

DPPs is for ACMA to assess the truth or falseness of the information DPPs have

allowed on their platforms or have censored.

5. The objective of the Bill to allow censoring is that "misinformation" or

"disinformation" is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm. Clause

2. Of the Bill defines harm at points (a) to (f) in such broad and vague terms as to

make it impossible to judge what is misinformation and thus will interfere with
freedom of speech.

6. The Government funds ACMA to the tune of about $lbillion per year. Our
understanding is that the Governor General has a role in the appointment of the

Chair, Deputy Chair and members, based on the recommendation of the

Government. The government of the day could recommend, for appointment as

members, persons who are supportive of the policies of the government and

opposed to the policies of the Opposition of the day. It is not inconceivable that, in

such circumstances, the Opposition policies could be censored as "misinformation".

**CONCLUSION**

In many ways the Bill, if passed into law, would be a major threat to free speech and the

powers conferred on the DPPs and ACMA as detailed above, would not strike an

appropriate balance in the matters of communication and the media.

Abuse of persons, groups or organisations must be prevented and there is an obligation

on DPPs to be conscious of and censor such abuse. This can also be pursued through
criminal law when necessary.

The most appropriate way to deal with possible misinformation and disinformation is to

allow response and vigorous debate so that, over time, what is misinformation or

disinformation and what is not, will be accurately established.

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

Disinformation) Bill 2023 should be withdrawn.
