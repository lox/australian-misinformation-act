# The exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I object to the above bill - please do not pass this bill!

Misinformation, disinformation, harmful - words that can be interpreted any way you
want! The interpretation of this bill is way too broad, this is dangerous to try and
define these words. Who gets to define what is Harmful?

I believe you must allow the people to decide what they see and read, so we do not
need a law to restrict our freedom of speech! People will always communicate and
some will see this for bad or good depending on their point of view!
The mainstream media already blocks out the real world so we do not need any
further censorship! Social media has allowed us to get a different perspective to the
gossip and nonsense of the mainstream media!

The terms of this bill are far too broad and cannot be defined! Our government is
protecting the wrong people – for only a totalitarian government would try to regulate
the truth, as in the George Orwell Classic novel "1984".
Making people live in fear is the beginning of a fascist structure! The 1950's
McCarthy-ism in America is being used here to scare Australians! ASPI is to blame
for this! They are backed by American weapons companies; - whose main interest, is
to push us into war. A real concern when you understand that there’s a reason the
American founding fathers enshrined freedom of speech in the US Constitution. It’s
the same reason that Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
Australia in 1948 helped to draft, states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of
opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers.” When governments contrive pretexts to limit speech, they
are heading down the dangerous path to totalitarianism.

Finally, I object to this Dangerous Law, because it does not do anything to improve
Australian citizens lives!
