**Feedback on the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

The draft legislation presented raises significant concerns regarding conflicts of interest,
misappropriation of power, and strategic influence. By excluding certain parties, such as
professional news media, educational institutions, and the government itself, the legislation
undermines the principles of a democratic society and the protection of freedom of
expression.

Firstly, excluding professional news content from the scope of the legislation creates a
worrisome situation. Professional news media plays a crucial role in informing the public and
holding power to account. However, there have been numerous instances where news
media outlets have been found to promote disinformation or misinformation for their own
political or corporate agendas. By exempting professional news content, the legislation fails
to address the potential harm caused by false or misleading information disseminated by
these outlets, which can erode the public's ability to make informed decisions and
contribute to a healthy democratic society.

Furthermore, the inclusion of educational institutions accredited by governments, both
domestic and foreign, as well as education providers aligned with the government, raises
concerns about strategic influence and the potential for bias in shaping students' opinions.
Education should foster critical thinking and encourage a diversity of perspectives, allowing
individuals to form their own opinions. However, when educational institutions are aligned
with government interests or influenced by political agendas, the education system can
become a tool for indoctrination rather than a platform for independent thought.

Similarly, the exclusion of the government from the legislation raises questions about
accountability and transparency. Governments should be subject to the same standards of
information dissemination as other entities. When governments are exempted, it opens the
door for the possibility of them using disinformation or misinformation to manipulate public
opinion or maintain their political power.

To substantiate these concerns, let's delve into a few real-world instances:

**1.** **Mediscare Campaign (Australian Labor Party): During the 2016 Australian federal**
election, the Australian Labor Party ran a campaign known as "mediscare," which alleged
that the government planned to privatize Medicare, the national healthcare system. The
campaign utilized misinformation to create fear and sway public opinion, causing significant
public outcry and political turmoil.

**2. Government Control of Media in Turkey: The Turkish government under President Recep**
Tayyip Erdogan has exerted significant influence over the media, leading to self-censorship
and limited freedom of expression. Numerous journalists and media outlets critical of the
government have faced intimidation, arrest, or closure, severely limiting the dissemination
of diverse perspectives.

**3. Education Reforms in Hungary: The Hungarian government led by Prime Minister Viktor**
Orban has implemented education reforms that have been widely criticized for promoting
nationalist ideologies and limiting academic freedom. These reforms aim to shape students'
opinions by instilling a particular political and cultural worldview, restricting critical thinking
and independent analysis.

**4. Misleading Reporting on Iraq War (USA): Leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, several**
major news outlets in the United States disseminated misleading information regarding
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) allegedly possessed by Iraq. These reports
contributed to the public's support for the war, despite the subsequent revelation that the
intelligence was flawed.

**5. Misinformation during Brexit Campaign (UK): The Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom**
was marred by widespread misinformation and disinformation. Claims about the financial
benefits of leaving the European Union and exaggerated statements regarding immigration
fuelled divisions and shaped public opinion, influencing the outcome of the referendum.

These vivid illustrations serve as a powerful reminder of the grave repercussions that stem
from an overreaching government's control over media outlets, education providers, and
professional news organizations. Such control places the future of Australians in jeopardy, as
it restricts access to reliable information, stifles the growth of independent perspectives, and
obstructs active participation in democratic processes. The imminent danger lies in the
alarming potential to indoctrinate our next generation, undermining the core values upon
which our society thrives. It is crucial that we recognize and confront this threat, for the
preservation of our nation's future depends on our unwavering commitment to a free and
vibrant society.

Furthermore, the exclusions outlined in the draft legislation (p. 11, Section 6) give rise to
several concerns regarding conflicts of interest, potential misconduct, and strategic
influence. By exempting certain entities such as professional news media, educational
institutions, and even the government itself from the legislation's scope, it undermines the
principles of a democratic society and encroaches upon the freedom of expression. This
approach runs counter to the provisions outlined in the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT)
statement, specifically guaranteeing the right to hold opinions without interference and the
freedom to seek, receive, and disseminate information and ideas.
