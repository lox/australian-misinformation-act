To whom it may concern.

By controlling misinformation and/or disinformation this bill is going to guarantee that real
information, backed by studies, is going to be blocked because the gate keepers on
information do not have the capacity to judge what is the difference between
misinformation and real information ( which they have already shown time and again )

If this bill causes misinformation to be hidden it will go underground and responsible people
will not have the chance to debate it.

What should happen is that people that disseminate any information should be held
accountable by not being allowed to hide behind aliases leaving them open to prosecution
by the normal courses.

Also there is no reason why, what is thought to be correct information ( rightly or wrongly )
cannot be added by the gate keepers to any considered misinformation so people have both
sides of the argument and they can make their own decision.

People must be educated and not kept in the dark by misinformation removal ( and as a
consequence real information removal ) by governmental authorities attempting to very
poorly and mistakenly trying to control it.

Education and identification of disseminators of any information is the pathway to
correcting misinformation and disinformation.
