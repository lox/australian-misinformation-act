It is my stance that the bill should NOT be approved.
Defining "misinformation" & "disinformation" is challenging, and is easily biased due
to ideological, political and financial interests. The persecution/censure/deregistration
of health care professionals who voiced their concerns re the COVID19 mRNA
vaccine cardiac side effects (which now has published scientific evidence to support
these concerns) is an example of how valid truthful views and persons were labelled
as "misinformation or disinformation", and silenced by the government agencies with
a specific agenda.
The bills outline of what constitutes "harm" is vague. As a democracy, ALL points of
view should be freely accessible for scrutiny and debate. If ACMA (ie the
government) can erase, remove, censure, material so that the public is not even
given access or opportunity to read all information available, then that is
unacceptable, and no better than a marxist regime.
The bill poses a threat to free expression, intellectual freedom, and the right of
political communication. Undermining the foundational principles of our democracy
will inhibit the free flow of ideas and evidence in the continuing search for evidence
based best practice.
Corporate conflicts of interest are real, and such conflicts can lead to biassed
reporting in academia, media content, skewed therapeutic guidelines, and profitdriven public polices which pose a danger to public health and safety. Transparency
of data and evidence must be maintained. Censorship has been used liberally during
the pandemic to create support for government messaging, which has resulted in
serious morbidity and mortality. Yet the true scope of harm has either been
downplayed, dismissed as trivial, or not even reported. If this bill passes, then this
information will simply be deleted, by unelected unknown unnamed "experts".
Finally, this bill can also be used to silence religious freedom of expression. Secular
views often supported by government and the mainstream media are portrayed as
"inclusive", with any opposing views labelled as hateful or wrong. This in itself is
discrimination. A true democracy allows for ALL views to be available so that
meaningful public debate and scrutiny can occur. No "side" should be silenced. No
government or "experts" should have the power to silence in a free democratic
society.
This bill represents government sanctioned censorship.
