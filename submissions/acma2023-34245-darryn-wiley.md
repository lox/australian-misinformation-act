# 20 August 2023

**Exposure Draft: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
# Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I do not support the introduction of this Bill for the following reasons:

1. It is clearly aimed at stopping clear & logical debate of important subjects by the general population
at large, particularly those subjects that stand to negatively impact lives. Proper discussion based
on clear & logical thinking is even more important today, given how crazy our world has become
since the COVID Pandemic.

2. This proposed Bill is clearly an attempt to silence critics of the China War rhetoric that is plaguing
our Mainstream Media on a daily basis. If China is such a threat to Australia, why have they not
attacked before now? Could we ourselves define this as misinformation?

3. What will define “Misinformation & Disinformation” and more importantly who will make these
definitions? Will this be done by public discussion or behind closed doors by the privileged few who
stand to gain the most by blocking such “misinformation”? What constitutes “Professional News &
Authorised Electoral Content”? Will hard evidence be used or will particular narratives drive this?

# 4. The requirements of this legislation on the Digital Media & Social Platforms to hold so called
“misleading information” data & files would be prohibitively expensive for the platforms and could
even result in paid only access to these platforms. This would result in even less opportunity for
ordinary people to participate in online discussions & debate, further curtailing free speech.

Sincerely,

Darryn Wiley.
