    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The legislation... will set a dangerous precedent regarding freedom of speech, while exacerbating the mistrust of public institutions, polarisation and extremist tendencies that it seeks to curtail.",
      "Misinformation is a very different proposition... it creates a category of ideas that can be constructed in social discourse as being special: dangerous, supposedly prone to 'infecting' people and spreading like a virus.",
      "It is clearly specious to deny that social media platforms are functionally public spaces, and therefore censorship of speech on these platforms is functionally equivalent to censorship in other public spaces.",
      "The power to determine what is misinformation is a very great one... giving an appointed (and therefore unelected) official this power could be seen as being contrary to the norms of a democratic country.",
      "Censorship poses to social cohesion... rather than restoring confidence in public institutions, it will actually worsen the breakdown in trust in these bodies."
