# 20 August 2023,

 This is my feedback submission below, regarding: 
 The exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023:

 With good reason I am of the opinion that the motives of the Australian government behind this bill is nothing to do with protecting Australians from anything but is in fact about censoring anyone who has a different view to the one the Government has decided will be the official one.

 I consider this proposed bill a power grab by government that would see government and bureaucrats become the single source of information allowed as well as being able to make arbitrary decisions to censor and shut down information of anything they do not approve of.

 I am of the opinion that Australian Federal and State Governments have forgotten what their purpose is being to serve the Australian people with honesty and integrity and have instead become totalitarian in nature interfering with peoples lives unnecessarily and without the consent of the Australian people.

 Worse still there is much evidence to suggest that Federal and State governments are abusing their office and Australian people by prioritising the interests of vested interest groups and unelected international organisations such as the United Nations and World Health Organisation and also banks, major shareholders, corporations and media organisations to the detriment of the Australian people.

 I consider myself a researcher of the highest calibre in regard to the social and financial engineering of society by governments and I have come to the conclusion that the Australian people are lied to on a regular basis by politicians, bureaucrats and the main stream media organisations including the Australian tax payer funded Australian Broadcasting Commission.

# These lies are made worse by way of the obfuscation of the facts and truth by main stream media organisations of anything they consider not in their interests.

 It is not appropriate for me to provide detailed evidence of my claims in this submission but I will provide two examples briefly. 
 The evidence is overwhelming and supported by thousands of academics, scientists and experts that both Climate Change and COVID-19 are not the threat they are claimed to be by government and the main stream media but are in fact lies and fraudulent and are indeed both social and economic engineering programs being implemented around the world by governments and vested interest groups. 
 Both these issues of Climate Change and COVID-19 have had a very big impact on Australians in regard to society and both have cost Australian tax payers billions of dollars but the Australian government and main stream media promote these lies as scientific consensus and the matter closed when nothing could be further from the truth.

 The narrative and Overton Window of discussion is very tightly controlled and monitored by government and main stream media.

 The Australian government has spent billions of dollars promoting both Climate Change and COVID-19 but almost nothing on discussion of alternative views and discussion of these two issues because they know that when it comes to coercing the Australian people the facts do not matter and that if you keep repeating a narrative over and over that the narrative takes on a life of its own and becomes the accepted truth despite being false. 
 With the rise of the popularity of social media like Twitter (now X), Facebook, You Tube etc. over the past decade it has become almost the only platform for academics, scientist and experts with dissenting views to that of government and the main stream media to express the facts, their research and opinions to the public.

# Therefore social media is clearly a threat to the lies and propaganda of government so government is working with the big technology social media organisations and introducing bills like this  Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 in order to censor and shut down those with dissenting information and views to theirs.

 We have free speech in Australia to an extent now but this bill wants to change that to provide protection to government and main stream media propaganda at the expense of dissenting views regardless of them being factual and the truth.

 Democracy cannot exist in Australia where the people are lied to and subject to government and main stream media propaganda on one hand and the truth obfuscated on the other and when good people try to raise the alarm by presenting the facts, telling the truth and informing people the only way they can being on on social media, their accounts are shut down. This bill will make this problem much worse.

 Much of the government and health authorities advice regarding COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns has now been proven to be false. Medical experts who tried to warn the Australian people that the government advice was false were censored and shut down by government and social and main stream media organisations as misinformation or disinformation when in fact it was true. 

 How many Australian’s including children were killed and injured by the experimental COVID-19 vaccines? And how many of these deaths could have been prevented if those medical experts that warned about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines were allowed to get their message out to the Australian people?  
 We will never know because the facts were obfuscated by government and health authorities and those medical experts with dissenting views warning about the dangers of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines were censored and their social media accounts shut down. This is a tragedy.

# The biggest source of misinformation and disinformation in Australia is from government and main stream media.

 This exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is simply a power grab by government who want to control the information the Australian people have access to.  

 Sadly the vast majority of hard working honest Australians are too busy working and taking care of their families to understand that Australian governments have become an extension of what could correctly be described as a cartel of vested interest groups and unelected international organisations such as the United Nations and World Health Organisation and also banks, major shareholders, corporations and media organisations and that the Australian people clearly come second or worse are just providers of revenue to used, abused and controlled.

 Australians are sick and tired of government telling them what to do, what is best for them and what information they should or should not have access to. This is not the business of government.

 And furthermore, do we have free speech or not?

 The Australian people can decide what is disinformation or misinformation and what the truth is and not some unelected bureaucrat or government agency.

 The exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is a disgusting attempt at government censorship and should be condemned and destroyed.

 Thank you for your consideration,

 Neville Klintberg.
