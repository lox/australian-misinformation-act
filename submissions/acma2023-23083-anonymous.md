Opinions on ACMA Disinformation, Misinformation Bill

  - Restriction of freedom of speech

  - Democratic rights compromised

  - Orwellian ideas enacted by Government

  - Bureaucrats deciding what is acceptable for individuals to express as an opinion

  - Government, with bureaucrats, giving their definitions of disinformation and misinformation

  - Covid showed that what was considered to be “conspiracy” theories, turned out to be the
truth – who will be able to question or investigate the supposed truths expressed by the
government?

  - A climate of fear for expressing an opinion. How much will individuals and corporations be
fined for expressing an opinion contrary to the governments? Who will be banned from
social media for such?

  - Is this the beginning of the slippery slope to government interfering in every aspect of an
individual’s personal life? How far will they reach? For example, will our bank accounts be
frozen if the government or ACMA doesn’t like the way we think/speak?
