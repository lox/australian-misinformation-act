    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The submission criticizes the Digital Service Standard guidelines as dystopian and arbitrary, particularly in their application to public communication.",
      "The definition of misinformation in the legislation is seen as problematic, as it gives government bodies the power to determine what is 'false, misleading or deceptive'.",
      "There is concern that digital platforms will over-censor content to avoid potential penalties, due to the vague criteria of 'reasonable likelihood' of harm.",
      "The submission argues that government figures and media should be held to the same standards of accountability, but are instead exempted under the legislation.",
      "The legislation is viewed as a power grab that could lead to increased censorship and decreased public trust in government and media."

    "Main Themes": [
      "Censorship and free speech",
      "Government overreach",
      "Accountability and double standards",
      "Public trust in government and media"
    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "A government may have a style guide it issues internally for its own communication but to foist this same requirement on the public is arbitrary and I do not take the threat of government censorship lightly.",
      "Public trust in government and established media is at an all-time low and falling. I can see this legislation as nothing other than an attempted power-grab.",
      "Censorship always does the bidding of evil, and this legislation will be no exception."
