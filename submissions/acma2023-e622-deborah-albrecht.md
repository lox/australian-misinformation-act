misinformation/disinformation. This is a move towards giving more and more bureaucrats the power to censor or silence those
experts who have dissonant voices that question the government narrative. Over the last 3 years we have witnessed many
previously highly respected doctors and scientists, who were at the top of their respective fields and who have more than earned
the right to have an opinion, being subject to horrendous silencing and smear campaigns. Real people sharing very real
experiences have also been shut down - because their experience didn't support the government narrative and therefore made
them look bad. Yet I have witnessed and experienced first hand, repetitively over the last 3 years, HUGE misinformation coming
from the MSM - grossly inaccurate reporting and omissions of vital information and accounts that the public need to be made
aware of so they are able to make well informed decisions and choices.  So - who gets to decide on what is 'misinformation'??
This sounds more like a move towards an Orwellian nightmare - where the Ministry for Truth is really the Ministry of Lies and the
government is all powerful, no matter how crazy their lies are or how many people see right through them.

Freedom of Speech is vital for a healthy democracy so I say a big NO to this Bill 2023.
