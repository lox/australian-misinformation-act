1. There is only one commonwealth and that's the commonwealth of Great Britain of which Australia is a part. It has a
prime minister that is supposed to be put forward by Parliament to be approved by the governor general, the
representative of the crown. This means that Australia under the governance of one system and cannot create its own
commonwealth.

2. The royal prerogative to deny assent was removed in 1688 by Parliament through the creation of the bill of rights
therefore Queen Victoria did not hold the authority of the people to grant assent to any commonwealth nation having
their own constitution as she was a treasonous monarch. So under the correct governing monarchy structure all fake
constitutions are null and void.

3. The Magna Carta 1215 is a democratic common law constitution that recognizes the people as the supreme judiciary
and legislature meaning the people govern themselves through the independence of the jury the judge and annul
government legislation.

4. The 1688 bill of rights took away jury independence so that a government dictatorship could be established..
Colonization began 100 years later therefore the colonies were established on the principles of dictatorship.

5. The 1901 was written by British parliament (a dictatorship) that set up Australia’s parliament as the supreme judiciary
see chapter 71 judicature act. Any system that gives government the power to judge the legitimacy of it’s own legislation
and the power to punish people into compliance is by definition a dictatorship.

6.Australia was setup as for profit outdoor prison whose largest revenue raiser was crime and prisons because
administered by Parliament considering it gave itself the power to write and enforce legislation the interfered with peoples
natural born rights.

7. Back in 1901 the people were ignorant and still are as to the meaning of democracy. They were led to believe democracy
was voting for two wings of the same bird with one agenda. By then voting in elections for a political party was well
established therefore what the people accepted as democracy. Consensus does not change the truth but it does become
what is accepted as truth.politcal parties only began to form prior to the creation of the bill of rights which signaled the
shift of power away from the last governmental failsafe mechanism of the monarch (takes an oath to protect the rights of
the people from government intrusion) denying assent to any legislation that infringes on the people’s rights.

8. Government has the capacity to become criminal in nature by being influenced by private interests and the only
mechanisms that prevent criminal government (royal prerogative and jury independence were removed in 1688.

9. By upholding the 1901 dictatorship people are saying they are bound to the ignorance of their forefathers to
remain a prison colony under government dicta10. The word democracy means the people rule not the people
vote for which flavour of slave master they want to be whipped by. Without jury independence the people are
enslaved. The 1901 is the antithesis of democracy and it's time for Australians to mature by understanding the sins
of the past so they can stop repeating them.

11. Magna Carta 1215 is a restatement of the democratic common law constitution that formed the construction of a
nation state which was sealed in perpetuity making it the sole constitution for the entire British Commonwealth realm
because a legitimate constitution imposes limits on what government can do not the people, so we need to take
responsibility and use the standards government knows it's bound to assert our natural born freedoms therefore liberating
ourselves from government dictatorship. Understanding the principles of democracy contained in the MC1215 is the only
solution to getting government get out of our way and back to its intended purpose of keeping the power on and emptying
the bins.
