 Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

This is my primary submission to the Department of the AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.

I make my submission on the ‘Question of Fact’ that in order to pass any law, concealed from the Australian
Elector at the 2022 Federal Election, is challengeable.

I will provide my evidence relevant to this proposed Bill, which renders this proposed legislation disabled &
defective, effected from the 2022 Federal Election due the fact that       -

‘NO STATE GOVERNOR’ issued a valid writ, for the election of Senators from a State, since 1980.

This has been accepted & concealed in the Steven Georganas MP, SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH
###### AUSTRALIA Case, at Adelaide, under Acting Judge Katrina Bochner - Charged for Misprision of Treason - TWICE!

 My submission argues that the proposed amendment is inappropriate & un-Constitutional to the role of
ACMA as the Communications Regulator. The proposed new powers for combatting misinformation and
###### disinformation is inconsistent with a democracy which must allow dissenting views to be expressed & discussed freely.

This submission points out the entrenched Australian Electoral flaws and contradictions in the draft
documentation. This is also the reason for the disabled exposure draft’s definition of **_“excluded_** **_contenf,._**

###### In the exposure draft, (p.6 & p.7), ACMA would apply the definition:

 excluded contentfor misinformation purposes means any ofthefollowing:

_(b)_ _professional_ _news_ _content_

_(e)_ _content_ _that_ _is_ _authorised_ _by:_
**_(i)_** **_the_** **_Commonwealth;_** **_or_**
**_(ii)_** **_a_** **_State;_** **_or_**
**_(Ui)_** **_a_** **_Territory;_** **_or_**
**_(iv)_** **_a_** **_local_** **_government_**

That is, content published by professional news or various levels of government, will not be considered
as misinformation. This assumes and implies **_excluded_** **_content_** is information, which is not necessarily
true. All the above are disabled from the draft proposed legislation in the absence of a valid
GOVERNOR of a STATE, to issue a valid Writ, under the MONARCH.

I will now refer to Ita BUTTROSE, Chair, AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
(ABC), who authorized & actively supports the article on the corporation website, titled      -

###### ‘This Man said Elections, mortgages & (council) rates are all invalid’.

 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-02/man-advises-clients-elections-rates-mortgages-are- invalid/102274956

I have personally written to Ita BUTTROSE’S Legal Counsel, and this response of nearly 500 pages remains current
and un-answered, regarding & exposing the ABC & ‘The 730 REPORT’, over misinformation during the COVID
pandemic. Ita BUTTROSE has given de Facto, tacit agreement to the fact      - **‘Elections** **are** **invalid’.**

###### What happens when Australian Electors challenge, or question or discuss any and all excluded content for their - ‘misinformation’ (which "contains information that statements that are blatantlyfalse, misleading or deceptive")!

How can ‘misinformation’ of **_excluded_** **_content_** be challenged & discussed & taken into a KING’S Court,
###### under the same ‘COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION ACT’ 1900 (Cth), that -

PRIME MINISTER ANTHONY ALBANESE MP, Re-Pledged his Secular Oath of Allegiance, to the
###### newly coronated Monarch, at WESTMINSTER, LONDON, on 6th MAY, 2023???

The ‘Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
###### 2023’, cannot continue until this Constitutional Issue is before the HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA - &
DECIDED BEYOND APPEAL.

The draft & proposed legislation requires transparency to the AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC & ELECTOR, is deceptively
###### written & considered & should be WITHDRAWN without further amendment, until the PRIME MINISTER opens
a public conversation with All Australians, before starting on a new BILL.

Finally, I am prepared to exercise my Right to attach the UNITED TRIBES COPYRIGHT TRADEMARK
document, which includes the NORTHERN TERRITORY of AUSTRALIA      - LOCAL COURT CASE, by CRAIG
OLDROYD, current & pending, for the issue of the unpaid     -

###### COPYRIGHT for the KANGAROO & EMU & all Native Animals & Birds, which now engages -

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT & all State & Territory Incorporated Governments, across

AUSTRALIA.

I will require a legal response, from my FEDERAL MEMBER, otherwise, PRIME MINISTER ALBANESE will be
actively trading in       -

Dear Ms Wang / Mr Schwager

**RE:** **OFFICIAL** **NOTICE** **OF** **DIRECTION** **TO** **CORRECT** **ERRORS** **&** **UPDATE** **RECORDS**

We write to you as members of the **_United_** **_Tribal_** **_Countries_** **_Land_** **_Alliance_** to introduce ourselves
as Original Crowns in right of the Independent Self-Governing Countries **TIBNLA** **of** **the** **Majagi,**
**Nyamal** **Widagura** **Putalyirri,** **Narrunga** **/** **Ngarrindjerri** **/** **Kaurna** **/** **Noongar,** **Jagalingou,**
**Nyangbul,** **Yanggu,** **Waa-Wurrung,** and **Palawa** **South** **East** **Tribe** on the terrain known to you
as _Terra_ _Australis_ (or Australia). This terrain’s history since colonisation has been built on fraud,
misrepresentation and without honour. The Original (Indigenous) Custodial Tribal Suverains and
Sovereign Nationals have claimed their unalienable God given rights and privileges to self­
determination, cultural, social, political, and religious freedoms under _Original_ _Custodial_ _Tribal_ _Law,_
_Customary_ _International_ _Humanitarian_ _Law_ and the _Law_ _of_ _Nations._

Our members have reconvened their ancient _pactums_ through their shared languages, dreaming
and songlines, which connect all tribes on this continent and beyond. We have all staked our claims
by placing our Countries Flag’s and Coat of Arms into our Tribal Estates, Mother Earth, such as
the example shown here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF_JoEbf-1M&t=38s) JoEbf-1M&t=38s. As per the _Law_
###### of the Belligerent, we have informed the belligerent occupiers that we are the “returning sovereign”
and informed the BAR Association and all body politics that their services are no longer required.

We have declared Peace! and reconvened our ancient treaties with foreign countries, Independent
Original (Indigenous) Custodial Tribal Suverain Countries, and Sovereign non-citizen Nationals.
We are all in compliance with the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, and
we have informed all quasi-Australian Federal State and Territory Governments and their
departments, acting agents, assigns, nominees, heirs and successors, including the British Crown,
US Corporation, the Vatican, and the United Nations, of our Lawful standing.

This official notice informs you that our Seeds _of_ _Governance_ and our _Original_ _Custodial_ _Tribal_ _Law_
