Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts,

I am writing regarding your request for feedback on the draft bill titled "Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". While I
appreciate the intention of combating misinformation and disinformation, I strongly believe that
this bill lacks consideration for the freedom of speech and poses several fundamental flaws that
need to be addressed. I am, to be direct, absolutely incensed by this bill, but will do my best to
respond constructively and addressing the points within the bill.

Firstly, the bill seems to divide society into two classes of citizens; the first, which includes
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions, while leaving ordinary citizens in
the second, is concerning. It disproportionately harms the regular citizens who have utilized the
power of the internet to express their voices. The internet has been an invaluable tool for
empowering regular people, and this bill absolutely risks undermining their freedom of speech.

Moreover, the excessive fines and the broad application of the code across the entire industry
will lead to more restriction on speech than currently exists. The lack of "pressure escape
valves" further compounds the harm that this bill can cause. It is essential to strike a balance
between combating misinformation and preserving the freedom of speech, and this bill does not
achieve that balance.

Accurately judging what is objectively true or false is an impossible task, as new information is
constantly being discovered, often contradicting what was once deemed absolute truth. The list
of examples provided in the body of text demonstrates that even expert consensus can change
over time. Imposing penalties on content that may be considered public health misinformation,
even if it was once widely accepted, poses significant risks to open and honest discussions.
Freedom of speech allows for the exploration of differing opinions and the pursuit of truth
through debate, which is a healthy part of any democracy.

Furthermore, the bill's scope extends to a large number of websites, including community
websites and social platforms. This appears to be an unintended consequence of focusing only
on major platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The broad definitions included in the bill
can unintentionally subject smaller websites, including those operated by individuals or
companies, to significant fines. It is unfair and unreasonable to impose legal risks on website
owners who may not even be aware of the industry codes they are expected to comply with.

The proposed bill's application without being limited to Australia’s geography – and therefore on
foreign entities is another concern. It is impractical and unrealistic to expect digital services from
all around the world to comply with Australian laws, industry codes, and standards. This
overreach of Australian law onto foreign entities may have unintended consequences, including
Australia becoming isolated from the global internet. It is crucial to consider the global nature of
the internet and maintain a respectful approach toward foreign entities.

In addition to these flaws, the proposed bill also delegates legislative power to private entities,
which raises constitutional concerns. The power granted to the ACMA to create ‘Misinformation
Codes’, along with the potential violation of the implied constitutional freedom of political
communication, needs to be thoroughly reconsidered.

In conclusion, while misinformation and disinformation do exist, the current draft bill fails to
adequately address the need for preserving the freedom of speech. I strongly urge you to
reconsider the flaws highlighted in this submission to ensure that any legislation on this matter
does not infringe upon fundamental and important democratic principles.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I hope this feedback is earnestly taken into
consideration, and will contribute to the improvement or better yet, the complete rescindment of
the draft bill.

Yours sincerely,

Chris Needham
