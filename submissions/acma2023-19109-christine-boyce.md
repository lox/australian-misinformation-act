# My Opposition to Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 Like so many others I have ceased or limited my dependence on mainstream media or publications as I no longer trust the content I am presented with. I do not have a social media account and agree that often-times content that is posted could be seen as questionable by those with differing views. I source my information from people and publications I trust and look to history for evidence of truth. 

 However, in a free society, everyone is entitled to an opinion and a right to voice that opinion understanding that some may find it ‘offensive’ or in opposition to their point of view. That is what constitutes a free society and we all have to accept that there is no consensus on opinion and everything should be open to debate. Some of us have to accept that being ‘offended’ and dealing with it is part of what it is to be human.  

 I am concerned that this proposed Bill will give this Government even more powers over the information we are allowed to access especially as it has been shown that we are already subject to Government imposed propaganda using mainstream media as their channel.  I have already suffered abuse, discrimination, humiliation and so have been harmed, not by social media content, but by the actions of this Government. They have not protected me so I have had to deal with how I have been treated in my own way – in other words I have had to ‘suck it up’.  I would be quite happy to discuss my experiences with any interested party. I am not afraid to speak out. What right has any Government to restrict the flow of free information when it is allowed to bully us with their ‘truth’. 

 I believe that the majority are intelligent enough to separate truth from fiction. I hope that most people recognise mis/disinformation as long as they have not been too brainwashed or coerced by this Government and their media lackeys to only accept their pronouncements. Mark Twain famously said ‘ It is easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled’

 We need to hang on to what vestige of freedom we have remaining before even our right to speak is removed and then we become a truly Orwellian society. I leave my last words again to Mark Twain.

 “Loyalty to country ALWAYS. Loyalty to government, when it deserves it.”
