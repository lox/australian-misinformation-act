**Re:** **Submission** **regarding** **the** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment** **(Combatting**

**Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **draft** **Bill** **2023** **('the** **draft** **Bill')**

**Introduction**

Family First Party welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Australian Government's
consultation on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the draft Bill).

The Family First Party is a movement of 30,000 supporters including 4,000 party members seeking to

stand for elected office women and men who will fight for and sustain the social and economic well­

being of the nation by promoting family, life, freedom and enterprise in the parliaments of Australia.

Family First is a political party for Australians of all faiths and none but recognises that the Judeo-

Christian ethic best provides freedom and tolerance for all. This ethic underpins the party's policy­
making for the common good.

**Concerns** **with** **the** **draft** **Bill:**

**1.** **The** **draft** **Bill** **is** **dangerous** **and** **unnecessary,** **does** **not** **incorporate** **adequate** **safeguards** **and**

**should** **not** **be** **enacted:**

##### • Family First Party is concerned that the draft Bill is like cracking an egg with a sledgehammer. It
will result in digital platform services shutting down valid evidence and information, important

discussions, debate and commentary, whistle-blower information, and emerging scientific
evidence. It will therefore have a significant adverse effect on both free speech and freedom of


-----

expression of Australian citizens. Australia is a democracy, and these are important freedoms for

citizens of democracies.

##### • The Government and social media platform fact-checkers are not always accurate and are

already blocking factually correct information. For example, a recent Family First Party social
media post referring to the 26-page Uluru Statement was blocked on social media for not being

accurate. The post has not been unblocked despite the fact the Uluru Statement has now been
proven to exist and a full copy has been publicly released by the media.

##### • Having a 'Ministry of Truth', where the Government of the day, unelected public servants and
unknown digital platform employees determine and control what is 'truth' and can or can't be

published has significant consequences for the rights of Australian citizens. This is a characteristic
of Communist and totalitarian regimes and has no place in democratic societies.

##### • The draft Bill and the existing regulatory regime involving a voluntary industry Code do not

contain adequate protections for free speech nor provisions to ensure digital platforms do not
over-block content. In contrast, The United Kingdom's Misinformation Bill contains does contain

some such protections.

##### • If enacted, the draft Bill will provide the legislative tool for a future Government to improperly

seize and control communications in Australia, and this is already fuelling community concerns
about Government oppression.

##### • Rather than the Government creating a costly regulatory regime that impinges upon citizens'
rights, and shutting down deemed 'misinformation/disinformation', a better, more cost-effective,
alternative option would be for the Federal Government to provide a website containing factual,
up-to-date information and evidence addressing key information/disinformation issues that
emerge. This will result in less administrative burden, reduced regulatory cost, and won't

impinge on Australian citizens freedoms of speech and expression. This could be similar in
nature to information provided regarding online scams, where anyone can check the information

and post that it is a scam.

**2.** **Definition** **of** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation** **should** **require** **that** **the** **content** **is** **'materially'**

**false,** **misleading** **and** **deceptive** **not** **just** **false,** **misleading** **and** **deceptive.**

Sub-sections 7 (1) (a) and 7 (2)(a) of the draft Bill, which contribute to the definitions of
misinformation and disinformation, provide that 'the content contains information that is false,

misleading or deceptive'. These are well-recognised concepts in Australian legislation.

There should be a materiality threshold test incorporated into these definitions, similar to _false_ _and_
_misleading_ provisions in other legislation such as the Corporations Act, to ensure that action is not
taken in relation to minor or immaterial matters, and to deter actions to weaponise the legislation.

**3.** **The** **'Harm'** **test** **in** **the** **definition** **of** **both** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation** **should** **be**

**removed** **as** **it** **is** **unnecessary** **and** **highly** **subjective,** **may** **result** **in** **duplicative** **regulation** **and**

**may** **potentially** **be** **misused** **to** **silence** **valid** **social** **commentary** **and** **policy** **debate.**

Sub-sections 7 (l)(d) and 7(2)(d) of the draft Bill also provide in the tests for determining if content is
misinformation or disinformation that 'the provision of the content on the digital service is

reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm'.

'Harm' is defined in Section 2 of Schedule 1 of the draft Bill to be any of the following:

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race,

gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability;


-----

(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;

(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State,
Territory or local government institutions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians;

(e) harm to the Australian environment;

(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the
Australian economy

##### • It is unnecessary to have the 'harm' test at all. It should be sufficient to determine that the
content is materially false, misleading or deceptive. Numerous other legislations governing
different types of false, misleading and deceptive conduct do not have a similar 'harm' test, even
though their purpose is to effectively protect against different types of harm, depending on the
context of the particular legislation.

##### • Any legislative test should be objective and be able to be resolved based on consideration of
available facts, information and evidence. Family First Party is concerned that the legal test of
'harm' in the draft Bill is highly subjective, not objective and sets a very dangerous low bar. It

relies on subjective, personal opinion that 'harm' may likely occur, not even that it has been

claimed to occur based on personal feelings of an individual, let alone proven to have occurred.

It also is not subject to a robust 'reasonable person' test. This leaves it open to serious abuse and

misuse.

##### • Such subjective tests can be easily weaponised and used to silence genuine debate on social
policy issues in the public sphere or to punish political enemies or advocates who hold different

perspectives. There are already a number of cases in Australia where activists for particular

issues are using legislation to claim they have felt 'harmed' by a comment made by an advocate
with an alternative perspective as part of genuine debate and discussion on current and complex

social issues. This creates enormous cost, stress and expense for the subjects of such complaints.

For example, currently a number of women raising concerns regarding women's rights and
opportunities due to the unfair advantage and safety issues of males who identify as women
competing in women's sporting competitions have had legal action taken against them.

##### • A number of the types of harms specified in the definition are matters already covered by
existing legislation. It is unnecessary and duplicative, and will create a material administrative

burden and costly red tape to have the same types of matters regulated under more than one
regulatory or legislative regime. Federal and State Governments have been working to unravel

and eliminate such legislated regulation duplication, as it is inefficient and costly and provides
uncertainty, and will likely give rise to inconsistent approaches, and differing views and
interpretations on similar matters.

**4.** **'Excluded** **content'** **exemptions** **should** **include** **recognised** **religious** **texts** **and** **teachings** **of**

**recognised** **faiths,** **such** **as** **the** **Bible,** **the** **Torah,** **the** **Koran** **and** **other** **faith-based** **texts,** **and**

**quotes** **and** **excerpts** **from** **these** **texts,** **plus** **teachings** **based** **on** **and** **aligned** **with** **these** **texts.**

##### • Section 2 Definitions in the Exposure Draft provides that 'excluded content for misinformation
purposes' which are exempt from the requirements is entertainment, parody and satire,

professional news content, content from educational institutions, and Government authorised
information. This is insufficient.

##### • There have already been cases in Australia where legal actions have been brought against
Australian citizens for quoting from recognised, long-standing faith religious texts which other
individuals have claimed have 'harmed' them. One high-profile example is Israel Folou which


-----

resulted in him losing his job. Any legislation needs to specifically exclude such teachings so this

legislation cannot be used by activists to attack people of faith and their beliefs.

**5.** **Any** **legislation** **should** **incorporate** **strong** **protections,** **including** **robust** **independent** **review**

**and** **administrative** **appeals** **processes,** **to** **protect** **Australian** **citizens** **and** **small** **businesses** **that**

**have** **had** **their** **content** **or** **accounts** **incorrectly** **blocked** **or** **removed:**

##### • Whilst it is indicated that "The ACMA would have no role in determining truthfulness, nor will it

have a role in taking down or requesting action regarding individual pieces of content." The

Australian Communications and Media Authority ('ACMA') will effectively have a role in
determining what is accurate or not through its ability to fine digital platforms for not addressing
information deemed as misinformation or disinformation.

##### • The proposed two-step process between a Government agency and digital platforms leaves

Australian citizens and businesses who have had their content wrongly blocked or accounts
disabled with little protection and none of the normal appeal rights that would apply under
other legislation which incorporate false, misleading or deceptive provisions, including the ability
to appeal in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

##### • In addition, the draft Bill, if enacted, will likely result in non-specialists in digital platforms and

ACMA making determinations about whether technical content matters of a specialist nature,

such as what is false, misleading or deceptive and what is harmful to a person's health or the

economy or environment. The current Voluntary Code system and what is reflected in the draft

Bill do not provide any transparency about this or decisions made, nor are there adequate and
transparent appeal processes for Australian citizens and small businesses who have been
negatively impacted by content removal or account disablement. In contrast, other agencies who

regulate false, misleading and deceptive conduct under particular legislations usually have
specialist knowledge and expertise available to assess the particular information of concern.

##### • The digital platform industry has established a complaints process, with an independent
committee to consider 'valid' code complaints. ACMA reports that this facility has only received a
limited number of complaints to date, and none have been valid1 so the independent committee

has had no matters to consider. Given the large volume of content being blocked, this suggests
that the current industry complaints process may be tokenistic and may not be providing a

viable, user-friendly, fair or effective dispute resolution process for impacted individuals or small

businesses.

##### • Australian citizens and small businesses should not be at the whim of unaccountable fact­

checkers and administrative staff of digital platforms.

##### • Given the significant impacts on individuals and small businesses, who may have invested

considerable time and effort building their 'brand' which is lost when content is invalidly

removed or accounts disabled:

`o` The current industry complaints process should be formally evaluated, to ensure there is

an effective, timely, cost-effective complaints and appeals process and to consider the

impacts of content and accounts being incorrectly blocked or disabled and protection to
ensure that these impacts can be avoided and effectively minimised.

`o` There should be a legislated independent complaints process that not only provides an
effective review process, but there also should be requirements for transparent decision­

making, and provision for formal administrative review.

-----

`o` There should also be a requirement on digital platforms to ensure accounts and content

are restored quickly if they are found to have been removed inappropriately. The
legislation should provide for such review and restoration to occur within a maximum
number of days.

**6.** **Transparency** **and** **accountability:**

In the interests of transparency and accountability, any legislation should incorporate a requirement
that any written or verbal instructions from the Minister, the Government, ACMA, or any other
Government Agency to digital platforms in relation to classifying particular content as being 'false,

misleading, deceptive or harmful' be disclosed publicly at the same time.

**In** **summary:**

Family First Party is opposed to this Bill being enacted at all. It is unnecessary as the issues can be

addressed in other effective ways such as providing factual information, and without creating a large,

costly, subjective regulatory regime that will impinge dangerously on free speech and freedom of
expression.

There needs to be strong protections in any legislation to protect both the rights of Australian

citizens and businesses from having their content or accounts wrongfully blocked or disabled, and to
protect freedom of expression and free speech, as outlined above. The proposed draft Bill is woefully
inadequate in this regard. The existing complaints handling processes under the Voluntary Code

should also be evaluated from this perspective and it should be ensured that Australia has a fast,
effective, complaints, appeals and restoration process for Australians who have been impacted by
their content or accounts being incorrectly blocked or deactivated.

Whether something is false, misleading or deceptive should also be subject to a materiality test or
threshold.

There should be no highly subjective and dangerous 'harm' test for determining if content is
misinformation or disinformation. Any legal test should be based on objective information and

evidence. Subjective tests are dangerous and can be weaponised to silence or attack others with
differing views.

The 'excluded content' exemptions in any legislation should include religious texts, and quotes,
excerpts and teachings based on these.
