Anonymous Submission

I wish to provide the following submissions regarding the proposed Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 ._

One of the main problems with this bill is it is advocating and legislating censorship.
What kind of a society do you aspire to live in? One that allows creativity, open
debate and discussion or authoritarianism and censorship. According to wikipedia
[“ Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information .](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech)
_This may be done on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful,_

_[sensitive, or "inconvenient". [ [2] [3] [4] ] Censorship can be conducted by governments, [ [5] ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship#cite_note-merriam-webster-2)_

_private institutions and other controlling bodies.”_

Once people thought the Earth was the centre of everything but later we learned that
the Earth is in orbit around the sun. Copernicus challenged the status quo and it
turns out that he was right. He only published his book the same year that he died.
The Catholic church banned Copernicus' book ín 1616 because they believed a
heliocentric theory with the Earth as it’s centre and Galileo was put before the
Roman inquisition in 1633, and he was put under house arrest for many years, even
though this ‘new’ theory was the correct one.

Sometimes more of the story unfolds later, just like a detective finds more clues.
Through advances in forensics and other advances for example, crimes have been
solved that were not solvable before. People believed that Lindy Chamberlain was
guilty but she was innocent the whole time and suffered so much, because people
made a mistake. The truth might not be fully known yet, and we find out more later.

People used to think cigarettes were safe and sexy, but cigarettes contribute to lung
cancer. There are discoveries all the time so our knowledge is growing. Truth is not
immutable. 2 + 2 = 4 but maybe other things should be questioned, debated and
open to discussion. Someone may be ahead of their time in knowledge or ideas and
not be appreciated or understood until a later time. Van Gogh struggled to sell any
paintings but now they are masterpieces and he is seen as a genius or great artist.

There used to be segregation of blacks and whites and much more slavery than
there is now. Martin Luthur King and others had to fight to assert their rights. Rosa
Louise McCauley Parks was a black woman who dared to get on a bus with white
people. We need people like this to be able to question the status quo and help
society wake up and move forward.

The fact sheet says “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety
and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy.”
However, I would counter this by proposing that censorship and not allowing freedom

of speech poses a greater threat to the safety and well being of Australians, as well
as democracy, society and economy.

Freedom of speech is important to democracy and to inventions and discoveries.
Without creativity and debate, we might not have new technologies and ideas.
Albert Einstein said something like “ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing
over and over expecting different results .” If we prevent people from speaking freely,
I think we are encouraging more of the same and preventing breakthroughs and
progress. If we discard differing and new ideas, we might never move forward or
change. If the designated authorities decide what is true or false and what is right
and what is wrong, this is more like an authoritarian regime, than a model of
democracy. Can this really be for the greatest good or a political tool or propaganda
to push the preferred narrative and control people?

What kind of a society do you aspire to live in? One that allows free speech,
creativity, open debate and discussion, or authoritarianism and censorship?
Censorship is a concern because it may be politically motivated and is part of
authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Who is to say what is the real truth? Who will
decide and how can they be infallible? All humans and all AI are fallible, so who can
be given the task to know the truth about everything and anything. What are the
checks and balances? The body of people deciding the truth - how will they be
chosen? Will there be a minimum IQ or education required or would it be ordinary
people? How will they maintain objectivity and avoid any conflicts of interest,
corruption or bribes and threats? Would you have different people for different
subject areas? What if the topic is over multiple areas of expertise? How can various
media companies and digital platforms be sure that they have found the Truth?

What about the story about different perspectives of an elephant? If you see it from
the front it is different from the back or the side or above. At the same time, it is still
an elephant. What if you hide half of the elephant because you think it is dangerous
or a threat. Perhaps someone has not seen this elephant before and you now offer
them a restricted view. At the same time, for many people this elephant is safe
because they have it in their circus or it is a form of transport in their culture. If
someone has never seen an elephant before and does not know what it is, and yet
you hide it from them for their protection - who will decide the ethics of that? We are
still discovering new fungi, plants and animals and naming them. So how can we
purport to know everything with certainty right now?

The NAZIs did not allow Jewish people to practise their religion and persecuted and
killed many Jews. Perhaps disallowing certain viewpoints or religions because
someone in authority disagrees is dangerous. Supposedly they were convinced they
were right too. It is dangerous to be dogmatic about truth and policy, not open to
questioning and change, because It is a form of authoritarianism and maybe a
slippery slope.

Humans were given free will, according to some philosophers, Christians and
individuals. We all have slightly different genes, viewpoints and upbringings.
Everyone contributes something unique. There are still consequences for what we
do and do not do, which could be physical, monetary, legal, or perhaps karmic. If you
try to make society homogenised this is like assuming that everyone needs to eat the
same food, or has the same likes and dislikes. We are not the same and this is part
of the magic of life. The whole is bigger than the parts (Gestalt theory), so that a
diverse team can achieve more than a single individual. If you try to make everyone
think and believe and read the same things, you are destroying what makes people
unique. Art and science rely on creativity to progress. Would you like to read the
same book or same film over and over and over again a hundred times? People
need variety, not just sameness to provide contrast and learn and grow optimally. Do
we want our society and individuals to fulfil their potential and bring their unique gifts
to the world?

If we seek a society that is only allowed to say yes, this could become a crazy world,
based on homogeneity, fear and authoritarianism. This scenario was turned into a
comedy in the movie Yes man with Jim Carrey? We were given minds to be able to
think for ourselves and question and make our own decisions. Free thought is
important. Have you ever changed your mind about something? People may change
their religion, their political party, even their gender. So why can’t we explore
contrasting ideas and give diverse people a chance to speak and express
themselves. Have you ever changed your mind on what is true or what is right?

In the past China banned Jane Eyre and Alice in Wonderland books that have
enriched the lives of many and been made into fabulous movies. Some countries
have even censored Wikipedia: “ Widespread censorship of Wikipedia has occurred
_[in countries including (but not limited to) China, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)_
_[Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela . Some instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia)_
_[are examples of widespread internet censorship in general that includes Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship)_
_content. Others are indicative of measures to prevent the viewing of specific content_
_deemed offensive.”_

In conclusion, this proposed bill Communications Legislation Amendment
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is detrimental towards_
human rights and contradicts various existing legislation. It is harmful to artistic
expression, political. philosophical and scientific debate and progress. This bill would
take Australia away from democracy and progress, and bring us closer to
authoritarianism, so we should not allow it. We need to learn from history and not

make the same mistakes. In order to grow and evolve, Australia needs to be open to
change and allow alternative viewpoints that may be ahead of their time and in future
prove to be right.
