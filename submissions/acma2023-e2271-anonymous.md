A response to the proposed combatting misinformation…bill

I would personally like to strongly object to the legal establishment of a government controlled (misinformation
and disinformation) bill and authority that determines what can or cannot be shared on social media and/or any
digital platform. The establishment of such a mechanism and authority to veto free speech and determine what is
truth by any government is guaranteed to create a divided, oppressive and dystopian society lacking
inventiveness and any progressive development. The very purpose of government is to equitably represent the
people who elected it. Therefore, any legislation that establishes what is the only acceptable thinking and speech
(one regulated over-arching opinion) to be embraced without the scientific principle of challenge is really a
thunderous step in the abolishment of the principles of fair and equitable government (regardless of whatever
side of politics we place ourselves). To pass such a bill into law is an attempt to stifle and silence any opposition
to the governing authority’s predominant narrative and is guaranteed to dumb-down the very people from whom
entrepreneurial and inventive development is needed to place Australia in the future forefront of the world stage.

Yours
