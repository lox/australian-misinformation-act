Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Freedom is a "human right", and Freedom of Speech is a human right that has been written into the UDHR, Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, Sections 18 and 19, of which Australia is a signatory.

It is therefore imperative that Australian Laws all maintain total integrity regarding Freedom of Speech.
Yet, the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation Law, should the Bill be passed, is an aggressive assault on the
Freedom of Speech of every Australian. Do you care?

What is "misinformation" specifically defined as? In possibly a majority of questionable issues, "misinformation"
becomes purely subjective rather than provable. What is "information" to one person may be "misinformation" to
another.
In my view it is a travesty to allow an unelected government body, ACMA, to be responsible for deciding what truth is,
regarding a huge range of subjective topics. And then shutting down all dissenting views. This is not democracy... it is
totalitarian authoritarianism.

More thought, speech, debate and Freedom of that speech is required for us to arrive at the truth on many issues, not
less. e.g. One hundred and fifty years ago it was thought that surgeons need not wash their hands between
operations, yet Dr Semmelweis using freedom of speech and advocacy proved the need for cleanliness and hand
sanitation of surgeons, thus saving many lives.

To pass this dangerous "Misinformation and Disinformation Bill" into law would be a blatant assault on Freedom of
Speech, to which every Citizen of a Free Australia is entitled. It would also be an obvious undermining of Australian
democratic way of life.

Please reject this Bill, and by so doing, maintain Freedom of Speech for all Australians.
