### 1. Terms of reference

In January 2023, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian Government would
introduce new laws to provide the independent regulator, the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat online “misinformation” and “disinformation”.

It is claimed that:

_The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital platforms to do_
_more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation and_
_disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech._

_The proposed powers would:_

   - _enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or require them to_
_keep certain records about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation_

   - _enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to_
_combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could_
_register and enforce_

   - _allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation),_
_should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and_
_disinformation on digital platforms._

_The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed from digital_
_platform services._

_The ACMA powers will strengthen and support the existing voluntary framework established by_
_the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (the voluntary code), and_
_will extend to non-signatories of the voluntary code.[1]_

### 2. Exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
 Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

#### 2.1. Threat to freedom of speech

One of the most significant characteristics of the human race is our capacity for speech. Through
speech people are able to share ideas, discover truth, form communities and develop nations.

Human history, including the development of civilisation, owes much to the knowledge, inventions
and culture made possible by the capacity of the human species for elaborate speech.


-----

In the development of modern democratic societies, freedom of speech is seen as a natural right
arising from the intrinsic nature of humanity and beyond the authority of governments. This is in
contrast with legal rights that are bestowed by governments.

Democratic society considers freedom of speech or expression to be one of our most cherished
freedoms. The essence of freedom of speech is not merely the freedom to express ideas, but the
freedom to disagree, dispute or cause controversy – an idea often witnessed in our political arena.
Indeed, a right not to be offended would stifle legitimate debate and limit political freedom – an
important concept in a functioning democracy. Speech also includes expression of personal beliefs
which might not be supported by evidence, and may be controversial, leading to robust debate.

Given the importance of free speech, it is deeply concerning that the Albanese government is
proposing what it terms the _Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation_
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023, but what is more appropriately called a “Censorship Bill”._

The Misinformation Bill will have a chilling effect on free speech, as the Victorian Bar has highlighted:

_The bill’s interference with the self-fulfilment of free expression will occur primarily by the_
_chilling self-censorship it will inevitably bring about in the individual users of the relevant services_
_(who may rationally wish to avoid any risk of being labelled a purveyor of misinformation or_
_disinformation). Even leaving aside this effect, it is not at all clear that the bill is required. It is to_
_be recalled that the problem of the dissemination of false information online has only relatively_
_recently risen to prominence and has so far been relatively effectively responded to.[2]_

But it is not just the risk of individuals self-censoring. There is also the self-censorship which social
media companies will impose on Australian users to avoid the risk of incurring fines, which as Justin
Quill has pointed out, are potentially massive:

_In short, the bill proposes enormous powers be given to the Australian Communications and_
_Media Authority to force social media companies such as Meta or Twitter to take down posts or_
_tweets that ACMA, in its apparent all-knowing wisdom, decides is false and causes serious harm._

_If the information deemed “false” is not taken down, these companies face fines of billions of_
_dollars. No, that is not a misprint, they could face fines in the billions because these fines can be_
_up to 5 per cent of a company’s global turnover, which for Meta could mean a fine of over $8bn_
_given the company’s global turnover is around $170bn._

With such huge fines there is a very real risk that social media companies will remove content which
is legitimate political material.

#### 2.2. What is “misinformation” or “disinformation”?

“Misinformation” and “disinformation” are defined in the Bill as, inter alia, content which “contains
information that is false, misleading or deceptive”.[3] However what content is “false, misleading or
deceptive” is highly subjective. The COVID lab leak theory was once considered a fringe theory but has
gained increasing acceptance. In March 2023, Nine News reported:

_FBI Director Christopher Wray has acknowledged that the bureau believes the COVID-19_
_pandemic was likely the result of a lab accident in Wuhan, China.[4]_

Sky News Australia reported:

_Information relating to the Wuhan lab and the origin of COVID that was once censored and_
_dismissed as a conspiracy has now been laid bare in black and white, according to Sky News host_
_Sharri Markson. Ms Markson said all of the declassified intelligence was first uncovered on Sky_
_News, The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and in her book: ‘What Really Happened in Wuhan’._


-----

_“The reason I’m talking about this tonight is … because it clearly shows why a new move by the_
_Albanese government is extremely dangerous,” she said. Social media companies will be fined_
_millions of dollars if they allow the spread of disinformation and misinformation on their_
_platforms in a new crackdown by the Albanese government, a move Ms Markson labelled as_
_“Orwellian style laws”. “I’m sorry, but who decides what is misinformation? This is extremely_
_dangerous,” Ms Markson said.[5]_

Peta Credlin has also highlighted the highly subjective nature of determining what is misinformation:

_Under the Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill, the Australian Communications_
_and Media Authority will be empowered to penalise online platforms that allow the propagation_
_of what ACMA considers “misinformation” (which is false) or “disinformation” (which is_
_deliberately false), if it has the potential to create “serious harm”._

_But harm is essentially whatever some faceless bureaucrat thinks might be damaging at any_
_given time. A good example is that back in June 2021, when ACMA first recommended this bill,_
_what it then regarded as harmful was any dissent from governments’ pandemic policies,_
_especially on lockdowns and vaccinations.[6]_

In the United States of America, the Hunter Biden laptop story is an interesting example of censorship
of content claimed to be misinformation:

**_Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say_**

_…_

_More than 50 former senior intelligence officials have signed on to a letter outlining their belief_
_that the recent disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Joe Biden’s son “has all the classic_
_earmarks of a Russian information operation.”_

_The letter, signed on Monday, centers around a batch of documents released by the New York_
_Post last week that purport to tie the Democratic nominee to his son Hunter’s business dealings._
_Under the banner headline “Biden Secret E-mails,” the Post reported it was given a copy of_
_Hunter Biden’s laptop hard drive by President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani,_
_who said he got it from a Mac shop owner in Delaware who also alerted the FBI._

_While the letter’s signatories presented no new evidence, they said their national security_
_experience had made them “deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant_
_role in this case” and cited several elements of the story that suggested the Kremlin’s hand at_
_work._

_“If we are right,” they added, “this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this_
_election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.”_

_Nick Shapiro, a former top aide under CIA director John Brennan, provided POLITICO with the_
_letter on Monday. He noted that “the IC leaders who have signed this letter worked for the past_
_four presidents, including Trump. The real power here however is the number of former,_
_working-level IC officers who want the American people to know that once again the Russians_
_are interfering.”[7]_

With so many former intel officials confident that the laptop emails were Russian disinformation it
must surely be true? Wrong – which news outlets, such as the New York Times, belatedly admitted.
Miranda Devine reported:

_There has been a lot of crowing this week about the fact that the New York Times has finally_
_come clean and admitted Hunter Biden’s laptop saga is not Russian disinformation. It’s real._

_You don’t say._


-----

_This old bombshell was buried in the 24th paragraph of a story buried on page 20 of the_
_newspaper, but at least the Grey Lady’s readers now know something that readers of The Daily_
_Telegraph and the New York Post knew 17 months ago._

_It is an indictment of the Times and a betrayal of their readers who were kept in the dark about_
_the true nature of Joe Biden before the 2020 election.[8]_

But in the meantime, the story had been heavily censored by Twitter (now X) which was acknowledged
by Twitter’s former head of trust and safety Yoel Roth as a mistake.[9] The Hunter Biden laptop story is
a cautionary tale about having a type of ‘Ministry of Truth’ deciding what is and isn’t misinformation.
In this instance, the claims that the laptop emails were Russian disinformation turned out to be
misinformation.

Section 2 of the Bill defines “harm” to include: “hatred against a group in Australian society on the
basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental
disability.”[10]

Aspects of the Bill which target matters around sex and sexuality are of particular concern given
falsehoods promulgated by LGBT ideology.

The idea that a person can change their sex is nonsense, as has been pointed out by Professor Lord
Robert Winston:

_I will say this categorically, that you cannot change your sex. Your sex actually is there in every_
_single cell in the body._

_We are very confused about this unfortunately and regrettably, it’s got into this argument that_
_people will now accuse me of being transphobic._

_Unfortunately you can’t say this publicly, this is one of the big problems. Even saying this on this_
_programme undoubtedly will result in my getting a huge amount of hate mail, it always does._

_It does affect a whole lot of issues in schools and elsewhere in our society. Of course we should_
_accept people as they are._

_Overall I think it’s a very sad thing that we can’t discuss biological science without actually_
_getting completely caught up emotionally in something that is just really completely wrong.[11]_

Neither hormone treatment nor surgery can actually change a person’s sex. This is a lie and pure
fantasy. Australian resident Alan Finch, who decided at age 19 years to transition from male to female
and had genital surgery in his 20s, later regretted this action which he described as “genital
mutilation”. At age 36, he told The Guardian newspaper in 2004:

_transsexualism was invented by psychiatrists… You fundamentally can’t change sex … the_
_surgery doesn’t alter you genetically. It’s genital mutilation. My ‘vagina’ was just the bag of my_
_scrotum. It’s like a pouch, like a kangaroo. What’s scary is you still feel like you have a penis_
_when you’re sexually aroused. It’s like phantom limb syndrome. It’s all been a terrible_
_misadventure. I’ve never been a woman, just Alan … the analogy I use about giving surgery to_
_someone desperate to change sex is it’s a bit like offering liposuction to an anorexic.[12]_

In 2021, Walt Heyer, a man who previously identified as a woman, told a FamilyVoice webinar:

_As a male biologically, I came to the conclusion that when the sperm hits the egg, that is the end_
_of the game. Your gender sex is fixed and innate and unchangeable from the time the sperm hits_
_the egg and here we are, a lot of people are trying to say that that doesn't happen, but_
_biologically and scientifically speaking it's fixed and unchangeable from the point of that sperm_
_hitting the egg._


-----

_So we're having a discussion about trying to change something that the sperm in the egg has_
_set in motion scientifically, biologically and medically speaking._

_People taking hormones like I did, or undergoing surgery, as a court document that I have on_
_record, the surgeon who performed my surgery and one of the authors of the standards of care_
_for transgender care, signed off on in superior court of California, acknowledge in that document_
_to the court that you cannot change a male into a female no matter how much surgery no matter_
_how much hormones._

_The only thing that they acknowledged was that you can neuter, they use the word neuter,_
_however your intermorphology never changes. And what we know today from research is that_
_there are 6,500 unique genes that differ between male and female and in those genes are_
_unchangeable just like when the sperm hit the egg, those things are fixed and unchangeable.[13]_

Will it be considered misinformation to state the facts in table 1 in the left column because they are
“harmful” or constitute “hatred” towards gender-confused men? Will it be considered
misinformation to make the statements in the left column but not the right given they depart from
LGBT orthodoxy?

**Reality** **Woke falsehood**

Men cannot get pregnant Men can get pregnant

Men cannot get periods Men can get periods

Men cannot be lesbians Men can be lesbians

There are two genders There are unlimited genders

You cannot change your sex You can change your sex

**_Table 1_**

The clampdown on those who dare to dissent from radical gender ideology is not far-fetched but is
already happening, as a Norwegian lesbian discovered:

_A Norwegian woman could spend up to three years in prison for saying that men are not able to_
_be lesbians._

_On November 17, Tonje Gjevjon was told that she was being investigated by the police over hate_
_speech because of a Facebook post that criticized men who said they were lesbians._

_Gjevjon is a lesbian artist who has faced intense pushback for standing up for women. In her_
_post, she also criticized transgender activists who try to prosecute women who are against_
_gender ideology._

_“It’s just as impossible for men to become lesbian as it is for men to become pregnant,” Gjevjon_
_wrote. “Men are men regardless of their sexual fetishes.”[14]_

Men cannot have babies, nor can they be lesbians, but that is what extreme gender ideology would
have us believe. It is inevitable that the more governments promote the gender lie that you can
change your sex, the more they will seek to suppress those who speak the truth. The Misinformation
Bill will aid this type of censorship.

|Reality|Woke falsehood|
|---|---|
|Men cannot get pregnant|Men can get pregnant|
|Men cannot get periods|Men can get periods|
|Men cannot be lesbians|Men can be lesbians|
|There are two genders|There are unlimited genders|
|You cannot change your sex|You can change your sex|


-----

#### 2.3. Censorship double standard

Section 2 of the Bill details various “excluded content for misinformation purposes”.[15] Concerns have
rightly been raised about the double standard of having censorship laws apply to some groups and
not to others:

_[Andrew] Bolt explained he was “shocked” reading through the proposal, pointing out that while_
_the bill would target everything from blogs, podcasts and people posting on Twitter, state and_
_federal governments would be exempted._

_“So governments can tell lies, spread misinformation that they call truth, but you could be_
_banned from challenging it,” the Sky News Australia host said.[16]_

The absurdity of the double standard has also been explained this way:

_The Bin the Bill website details a series of criticisms of the proposed law._

_These include the claims that government-authorised information could not be counted as_
_misinformation under the bill, “but if you criticise the Government, that can be misinformation.”_

_That claims by university academics can’t be counted as misinformation, but “if you disagree_
_with the academic that can be.”_

_And that the government would be able to “exclude its favourite websites” from being captured_
_by the law, but that the same material posted on other websites could still be branded as_
_misinformation.[17]_

This double standard creates an uneven playing field and will make it harder for citizens to counter
powerful false government narratives.

### Conclusion

Freedom of speech is one of our most cherished freedoms. The essence of freedom of speech is not
merely the freedom to express ideas, but the freedom to disagree, dispute or cause controversy.

Whether content is misinformation or disinformation is highly subjective and can be completely
wrong, as was the case with Hunter Biden’s laptop.

The Misinformation Bill will have a chilling effect on free speech with both individuals self-censoring
themselves and social media companies censoring individuals. The Misinformation Bill is bad
legislation and should be opposed.
