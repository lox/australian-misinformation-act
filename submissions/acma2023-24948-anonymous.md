To whom it may Concern,

It is imperative that a healthy society has the right to expose knowledge necessary to ones rights and
freedoms and to have the rights of beliefs of ones choosing, expressed peacefully and constructively
with the security from persecution and tyranny of those expressed beliefs.

One of the highest forms of ignorance is when people with vested interests selfishly reject something
to advance their own positions while ignoring the facts, they are the people who unethically spread
misinformation.

Censorship is communism and demoralizes a population, governments with integrity support open
and honest debate.

Kind regards
