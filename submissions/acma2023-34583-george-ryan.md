 OBJECTION TO:

 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating MisinformationandDisinformation) Bill 2023

**As an Australian citizen and a practicing lawyer for more than 45 years I**
**wish to register my objection to the proposed Communications Legislation**
**Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

**The Bill proceeds on a misconception that it is objectively possible to**
**separate out information that is free from error or content that could offend**
**someone, from information that is erroneous or hurtful to someone. The**
**history of ideas has often shown that information many thought to be**
**correct in one era has later been found to be wrongly based or**
**misconceived by a later generation.**

**Furthermore the idea that the alleged erroneous parts of information can be**
**responsible for causing harm to someone or have potential to cause harm**
**is an illogical and unbounded concept. The Oxford dictionary, and any**
**number of science or medical textbooks have plenty of information in them**
**that can be used to cause harm. What of the ancient wisdom, “ Sticks and**
**stones break my bones but words never hurt me.”**

**The Bill employs the standard legislative method for solving all perceived**
**modern-day ills; more government regulation. This legislation follows the**
**same failed model, building ever more government bureaucracy on existing**
**bureaucracy; more confusing rules and onerous regulations serving the**
**primary objective of keeping unelected and unaccountable government**
**officials in employment.**

**The belief that some regulatory authority will be able to discern what is**
**correct, non-misleading information from what is not, can only lead to the**
**realization of the Orwellian nightmare clearly foretold in the novel, “1984”**

**The result of this legislation will be to give faceless people the**


-----

**indiscriminate power to decide what is “good” information and what is**
**“bad” information, what information is “harmful” and what is “harmless”,**
**when in truth these dualities are arbitrary and nonsensical. But a new**
**Truth bureaucracy will impose itself on the non-government sector**
**demanding individuals and businesses carry out onerous reporting,**
**recording and other time-consuming tasks in justification of the new**
**bureaucracy’s existence, all without payment.**

**As well as this further tax on individuals and businesses, the legislation**
**will mark the end of freedom of speech in Australia. A free and open**
**society depends on the free exchange of ideas [including cranky ones as**
**presently perceived]. The proposed legislation will only enshrine more**
**intolerance, with the Truth more and more owned by those usurping**
**political power. This road has been travelled many times before and the**
**wisdom of those in previous eras who experienced it still holds good. The**
**words of Voltaire come to mind,**

**“I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right**
**to say it.”**

**But then is it disinformation to continue to attribute these words to**
**Monsieur Voltaire?**
