I strongly oppose this Bill as it will be ineffective and will curtail free speech. George Orwell would find it familiar.

Presumably this Bill was motivated by fear of the impact of misinformation during COVID. However, some of the
"misinformation" during COVID turns out to be true. For example governments around Australia said a number of things during
COVID (and big tech and media spread them) which turned out to be untrue or dubious, for example:

That extended and general lockdowns were warranted and provided net benefits - multiple credible meta studies studies
both before and after COVID have found the opposite
That masks are effective in reducing spread of COVID - again, the highly reputable Cochrane Review meta study
confirmed this is a dubious claim
That vaccines reduce the spread COVID - the very solid Cleveland studies I and II showed this to be untrue, in fact the
opposite (showed a statistically significant correlation between the number of doses and likelihood of getting COVID,
suggested that the highly boosted are in fact more infectious than the unvaccinated)
That vaccines are safe and effective - massive increases in unexpected mortality post vaccines worldwide are
increasingly being attributed largely to COVID vaccines, in particular from heart disease - it seems to be emerging that
the net benefit is likely to be negative for most cohorts. Even the initial test results (eg ) actually showed higher
deaths in the vaccinated group compared to the control group, and yet authorities (including the TGA) still said
they were safe and effective - a dubious claim at teh time and even more so now. The emergency use legislation was
used to release novel mRNA vaccines that did not go through the normal testing and evidence of significant adverse
events is emerging now.

A number of renowned scientists and other scholars and thinkers who correctly pointed out a lot of the above were actually
censored and deplatformed during and after COVID.

So, how are we to trust government and big tech / media to oversight and manage a process to discern what is misinformation
when during COVID when it turns out they were actually a major source of the misinformation? I note that governments are not
only exempt from this Bill but are also effectively now the arbiter of what is truth.

Free speech is important as a democratic principle. It also encourages wide ranging scientific debate rather than suppressing it,
and is likely to be more effective in reducing misinformation than the supposed benefits of following often flawed government
advice in suppressing free speech.

This Bill is a major overreach that is unjustified. There are already significant powers in cases of real emergencies. Free speech is
more powerful and effective than the illusory benefits of government censorship.

I am happy for this submission to be made public.

Yours sincerely
