Points for note.
How can Australian Government be members of the WEF? (World Economic Forum).

Based upon Australian Constitution
Chapter 1 Point 44
44. Disqualification
Any person who:
(i) is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power,
or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a
foreign power; or...

I take this to mean, WEF members are ineligible to be in parliament and should be
disqualified.

The WHO (World Health Organisation) is a foreign United Nations organisation. IF
Australian governmental bodies are ACTING upon WHO information, whether or not WHO
is categorised as a Foreign Power is irrelevant BECAUSE Australian governmental bodies
are ACTING upon WHO information. Therefore they are a De-Facto foreign power.

Under
Part V â€“ Powers of the Parliament
51. Legislative powers of the Parliament
The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace,
order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:

The Parliament has NOT been able to effect peace, order and good government. This is
apparent by the largest demonstration in Canberra 2022.

The only reason the government is trying to implement this legislation is to hide failings in
the governance of the following constitutional responsibilities of almost every point of the
Australian Constitution.
