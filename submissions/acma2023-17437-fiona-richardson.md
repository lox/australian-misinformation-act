I do not agree with the proposal for the following reasons:

There already exists sufficient legal provision against hate speech, scams and slander. I do

not believe that ‘misinformation’ is a danger to the Australian people; I do believe that the

concept of ‘misinformation’ is; this is pure censorship and a worrying attack on free speech.

People have always been exposed to large amounts of information which they must use

their discretion, discernment and intelligence to sort through. Newspapers frequently

present sensationalism, not facts; advertising presents false claims as truth. A sceptical

mindset is a prerequisite to navigate the modern world without being taken in at every turn.

What is worrying about this proposed amendment is, who decides what is misinformation?

Over the past 4 years we have seen verifiable facts, such as, “the covid 19 ‘vaccines’ are not

safe and effective and have harmful side effects” vilified as misinformation, and the people

who try to disseminate this information, attacked and silenced, while the true

misinformation, that “covid 19 ‘vaccines’ are safe and effective with no harmful side

effects”, was disseminated by the people sitting in judgement. If they knew the facts and

were deliberately propagating false and harmful information, then they themselves were

disseminating ‘disinformation.’ It is interesting that the government is still promoting this

fallacy when the ‘vaccine’ manufacturers themselves have admitted that their products are

not safe and effective. This would seem to indicate that once the government has taken a

stance they stick to it and do not perform due diligence by keeping up to date with current

and emerging data.

Doctors who recommended effective, proven measures against coronavirus were

threatened with disciplinary action and accused of spreading harmful misinformation, when

they were actually providing information that could save lives. The silencing of this

information has cost thousands of lives. If this were a deliberate action on the part of the

decision makers it would be an act of mass murder. If it was just ignorance and poor

judgement it still cost thousands of lives.

So called ‘Fact checkers’ did not check facts, they merely censored any alternative views and

repeated propaganda, such as ‘Covid vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety’ which has

since been shown to be untrue. They did not provide any research or data to back up their

claims, whereas the information they ‘fact checked’ was frequently meticulously researched

and published in professional journals, such as The Lancet and British Medical Journal. This

indicates that we cannot trust a governmental agency to decide what is fact and what is

misinformation, as they have themselves been, knowingly or unknowingly, promoting the

spread of misinformation for the past four years.

The exemption for the purposes of entertainment and satire works both ways and is also

worrying. This is granting permission to mock and ridicule other people’s beliefs while

denying those people the opportunity to respond. This could be seen as state sanctioned

gaslighting and bullying.

People have the right to believe what they choose. There is no place in an enlightened

society for thought police. If a person’s beliefs lead to them behaving in an illegal manner,

we have laws to deal with that. It is the actions, not the thoughts or beliefs, that are illegal.

This amendment looks worryingly like the work of a dictatorship and not a democracy.
