Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts,

I am writing to express my deep anger and outrage at the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is evident that this bill
demonstrates a lack of respect for the freedom of speech of Australian citizens.

This bill effectively creates two classes of citizens, with one group consisting of politicians,
mainstream journalists, and members of educational institutions who will have the power to spread
information, whether accurate or not, online. The second group consists of regular citizens who
often possess more knowledge on certain topics than those in the first category, such as industry
insiders, and also citizen journalists who are often more rigorous in their work than those in the
mainstream. This legislation puts regular citizens, who have found their voice through the power of
the internet, at a significant disadvantage.

The excessive fines outlined in the bill will result in digital services being overly restrictive in terms of
speech, even more so than the most restrictive digital services currently in operation. The problem is
further compounded by the fact that the code applies across the entire industry, leaving no room for
any escape valve in the system.

Accurately determining what is true or false is a nearly impossible task. New information is
constantly emerging that challenges what was once widely accepted as fact. The bill's broad
definitions could potentially categorize various statements, such as those related to COVID-19, as
public health misinformation. This opens the door for the removal of content that may actually be
true but is deemed misleading or deceptive. Freedom of speech is crucial as it allows for open and
honest discussions and the exploration of different perspectives until common ground is reached.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious
concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His statement on Twitter highlights the
challenges that arise when attempting to implement legislation on misinformation, stating that it
would be impossible to effectively enforce and would likely result in fines being levied on content
that is not, or turns out not to be, misinformation.

Furthermore, this bill appears to only consider larger platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter,
but inadvertently includes thousands of community websites due to its broad definitions. This
oversight demonstrates a lack of thorough consideration and understanding of the impact this bill
may have on smaller websites.

The legal risk imposed by the bill presents an unreasonable restriction on our freedom, liberty, and
the right to freedom of speech and enterprise. An individual website owner, both within and outside
of Australia, with social features like comments or forums, could potentially face fines up to
AU$500,000, while companies could face fines up to AU$2,500,000. Additionally, the expectation
that website owners should comply with industry codes they may not even be aware of raises
serious concerns about fairness and due process.

The proposed delegation of legislative power to private entities that are not directly responsible to
Parliament, as outlined in the bill, amounts to an unconstitutional abdication of legislative power.
This is a significant concern, as it violates the implied constitutional freedom of political
communication.

The bill assumes that the government and accredited media and educational institutions can
determine truth without taking the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians into account.
This dismissive attitude towards the viewpoints of regular citizens undermines the democratic
process and hampers diversity in perspectives.

The threats and potential interference outlined in the bill towards digital platform providers and
users further erode our freedom and sense of security. The imposition of reputational damage,
financial penalties, and the imposition of obligations on businesses and individuals adds unnecessary
stress, distress, and inefficiency to their lives. The requirement to potentially report on friends,
family, or political co-agitants is reminiscent of oppressive regimes and goes against the spirit of
Australian mateship.

The categorization of political party viewpoints as misinformation and subsequent removal from
digital platforms will leave voters in the dark and hinder the democratic process. Independent media
organizations, journalists, and bloggers will face complex reporting standards and misinformation
reports seeking to ruin their reputations. This ultimately perpetuates a system where only
government-approved media outlets benefit financially, creating a skewed and unbalanced
information landscape.

The categorization of different citizens into classes, with trust only placed in those deemed worthy
by the government, is in direct contradiction to the principles enshrined in international human
rights declarations. Freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, expression, and access to
information are fundamental rights that should be respected and protected.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. It undermines freedom of speech and imposes
unreasonable restrictions on regular citizens. The broad definitions, lack of consideration for smaller
websites, and potential for abuse raise significant concerns about the impact this bill will have on
our democratic society.

I urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts to reconsider this bill and instead focus on promoting critical thinking, media literacy, and open
dialogue as effective means of combatting misinformation and disinformation. While considering the
question, please cogitate on the image below. Debate is essential for progress, for freedom, and for
basic human rights.

Yours sincerely,

Andreas Mijic
