 New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

 1 Submission

This is yet another insult from government. It is antithetical to our system
of governance, impossible to do properly, ethically and morally wrong and a
further example of Australian governments working hard over decades to extinguish the light on the hill. Perhaps it isn’t too surprising. I have spoken
with sitting senators who couldn’t describe Natural Rights, let alone articulate
that Australia’s Constitution was written by people who believed that there is
a class of rights outside the purview of government. These authors believed
this because they saw the only alternative as violence (Appendix A). Indeed,
one of the primary arguments against the Constitution as written was that it
did not recognise the Natural Rights of Indigenous Australians; allowing the
government to make race based laws.

History is full of examples of governments believing they are acting in the
best interests of their citizens by overriding their Natural Rights and this has
always led to the biggest tragedies. Popularity alone cannot be used to determine whether something is within the scope of government to address. Even
in Australia’s history, the internment of citizens by government during the first
and second world wars was popular, as were acts like the Northern Territory
_Aboriginals ACT 1910. While there isn’t a great deal I’d agree with former Attor-_
ney General George Brandis about, he was absolutely correct when he said that
people have a right to be bigots. To speak is to think, and thinking through the
complexity of life is the only way to become a better person. It’s always framed
as for the greater good, but there has never been a time in history where the
censors were the good guys. Censorship always drives bad ideas underground
where they fester, and the inevitable mislabelling of truths as untruths only sows
distrust and division. This has perhaps best been put by C.S. Lewis[1]:


Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its
victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live
under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The
robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at
some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good
will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their
own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at
the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness

stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one’s will and
cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on
a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those
who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic
animals.

Even if it weren’t an inherently repugnant position, and it were possible
that the censorship of incorrect information could lead to good outcomes, how
would the government be able to divine what is true? Science, which is the
best means we have of evaluating truth, is still in the midst of a replication
crisis and we know most published research is wrong[2]. In some fields, subsequent replication studies have found that as few as 36% of published papers
can be reproduced. This includes researchers working on dishonesty[3] and research published at Australian universities[4]. There doesn’t even have to be
malicious intent; laziness and carelessness are also inherent to the human condition. Then consider the profit motive and how difficult it is to get a man to
understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it.
Government has repeatedly demonstrated its incompetence and maliciousness;
it is a certainty that these powers would be used to censor correct information,
or information that is damaging to the regime that would affect the governing
party’s popularity. There is no safe way to wield this power, and no way for
government to actually rule on what is true, especially for novel scenarios.

Australian governments have worked hard over several decades to demonstrate they are the largest source of misinformation and disinformation, and do
not care about truth. From claims that Iraq had weapons of Mass Destruction
(Appendix B), to children overboard to No Carbon Tax Under The Government
I lead. It isn’t as if even spying on a neighbour to exploit resources is beneath
them[5]. It has allowed an Australian citizen to be tortured by a supposed ally
for over a decade; a man whose only crime was actual journalism. Only now
that this man is no longer capable of being a threat, do we hear weak noises
that maybe it is time to bring him home. So weak a statement that it was dismissed out of hand by our "ally". We know that government is already engaging
in censorship (Appendix C), and, as usual, it is done in the most incompetent
way possible. We know the left hand of government won’t let the right hand

know how extensive the censorship is (Appendix D). We know the government
oversold the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine, even before it became available
in the country (Appendix E), yet that didn’t stop it enabling one of the most
reprehensible schemes in Australia’s history; a system to monitor which citizens
complied with mandated medical procedures in order to participate in society[6].
A complete violation of informed consent, something we as a species decided
70 years was a crime against humanity and a capital crime. Next thing we
know, the government will be telling us that consulting firms won’t use their
knowledge to defraud taxpayers[7].

Of course, that’s not what this is really about. Like most things, this is a
values argument masquerading as a fact argument. Ultimately, facts don’t really
matter. That’s not how people make decisions. Values come first and then facts
are selected to support those values. If we want to accomplish some goal, science will tell you how best to accomplish it, but it says nothing about whether
the goal itself is a good one to have or not. The USSR tried to cross smallpox
and ebola as part of their biological weapons program. Science helped them
work towards that goal, but this is a goal that most people would realise is
completely insane.

When it is something that harms ordinary Australians, like the theft of millions of quality-adjusted life years, the erosion of financial security of millions
of Australians (with the worst still to come), the destruction of the emotional,
physical and social health of the population or continued excess deaths[8], no one
in government cares. If there is political capital to be made, whether pink bats,
Robodebt or soon the Australian Securities And Investment Commission, only
then something will be seen to be done. Even in that case, no one ever really
faces punishment. "It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way
of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who
pay no price for being wrong"[9].

What is really necessary is for government to show humility after all the
damage it has already done. This is a time for restitution, not to compound
on previous mistakes. In the end, the trust and power of a government can

Individual Submission A Natural Rights

# A Natural Rights

Justice Andrew Inglis Clark, the man many consider the primary architect of
the Constitution, wrote[10]:

If human nature has not any natural or inherent rights which can
claim recognition to restrain a preponderance of physical force or
the arbitrary will of majorities, then the weak and all minorities
are without verifiable authority or justification for resisting oppression. Might is the ultimate foundation and criterion of right and
the highest political ideal men can safely cherish is the rule of the
benevolent despot. Are we prepared to accept this conclusion as
the final goal of all the efforts and struggles which humanity has
made and endured to reach the best possible conditions of human
well being?

Individual Submission B Iraq

# B Iraq

Excerpt from Howard’s Statement To Parliament On Iraq[11]

The other point of agreement shared by members in this House, by
our community and by the community of nations is that Iraq must
not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction – for the
security and stability of our world, it must be disarmed.

For years the nations of the world have sought to persuade Iraq
to abandon these most offensive of weapons. The Iraqi President,
Saddam Hussein, has refused to comply and now the weight of the
world’s attention has fallen on him. Only one nation can determine
whether force will be necessary or not. Only one nation, acting
alone, can make the choice for peace. That nation is Iraq.

Full disclosure by Iraq of its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
programmes and immediate and total cooperation by Iraq with the
provisions of resolution 1441 of the Security Council will remove the
need for military action.

In his report to the Security Council, Dr Hans Blix, the head of
the United Nations weapons inspection body for Iraq, made it clear
where he believed that the responsibility for the current terrible
impasse lay, and I quote:

“Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance – not even
today – of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which
it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live
in peace”.

Of at least one thing we can all be absolutely certain – if the world
turns its back on the threat posed by Iraq; if the community of
nations gives up because it is all too hard, then Saddam Hussein
will not reward us with benign behaviour.

Such weakness, such an abject failure of international will, will - as
in the past - be treated with contempt.

Iraq will not only keep her current weapons but will add to them.
Saddam Hussein will not abandon his chemical and biological weapons
programmes. He will keep striving to build a nuclear capacity.
And he will almost certainly, at some time in the future, use these
weapons to fulfil his ambition to dominate his region.

Individual Submission C Censorship

# C Censorship

Excerpts from Twitter Files Extra: The Covid Censorship Requests of Australia’s
Department of Home Affairs[12]

In the #TwitterFiles, Racket found 18 DHA emails, collectively requesting 222 tweets be taken down. Jokes and information that later
turned out to be true were frequently included in the censorship requests, which came from something called the “Social Cohesion
Division” of the DHA’s “Extremism Insights and Communication”
office, not that DHA staffers were entirely sure of their spelling in
every case:

This is anti-disinformation 101: a group that can’t spell-check becoming the “fact-checking” authority for an entire nation, and as
we’ll later learn, globally. The same level of care was seemingly
paid to requests and the value of free speech more broadly.

. . .

Whether or not any staff had public health expertise remains unknown. The DHA rarely provided evidence for their counter-claims
and where they do, they rely on “fact-checking” organizations like
Yahoo! and USA Today, rather than on Australia’s own scientists.

. . .

These “hefty lists” included jokes, accounts with as few as 20 followers, claims that turned out to be true, and non-Australians “circulating a claim in Australia’s digital information environment.”

Even a humorous commentary on masks was deemed too much
for the fun police. In one case, a mere reply to a tweet claiming
“masks are useless” was considered to have contradicted “official
information,” making it “potentially harmful”:

While it is simple fact that there is no robust evidence that masks are effective at stopping respiratory infections (Appendix C.1), it is a matter of opinion
whether Daniel Andrews is useless. A right to freedom of political speech has
been read into the Constitution, so this is yet another example of government
being either incompetent or malicious.

DHA called upon Twitter’s own policy that penalized questioning the efficacy of masks. This is ironic, considering a recent
Cochrane Review meta-study of masks concluded, “The pooled results of RCTs [randomized control trials] did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical
masks.” Cochrane is considered the gold standard in medical metaanalysis.[. . . ]

Regardless, the conclusion of DHA and Twitter was that “government officials” should never be challenged, and that discussing contested topics requires banishment to digital Siberia, to say nothing
of what used to be a time-honored Australian tradition of poking
fun at authority. (The account in question has been suspended).

. . .

The DHA went well beyond even pretending to police mis- and
disinformation. In one case, they argued a post should be removed
because a user claimed the government — specifically the Minister
for Health — had used “emotionally manipulative language.” The

tweet in question (below) garnered just 8 likes and 2 retweets, and
again escaped the micro-managers.

. . .

During the Covid-19 crisis, the Australian government appears to
have taken the same approach as its Five Eye cousins, freely mixing
concepts of violent extremism and “social cohesion” with legitimate
concerns of citizens regarding government panic, lack of expertise,
and overreach. From our review, little to none of the content that
was flagged came from “extremists.” Rather it was and is from everyday Australians and foreigners who disagreed with government
policy. Some of their claims are indeed far-out and/or at least esoteric, but “characters” are part of life, and being unusual doesn’t
justify a dragnet approach to censorship.

## C.1 Masks

Extract from the 2020 Cochrane Library Review[13]

There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks. The lowmoderate certainty of the evidence means our confidence in the
effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different
from the observed estimate of the effect. The pooled results of randomised trials did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral
infection with the use of medical/surgical masks during seasonal
influenza. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare
workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection.

Retailers who cash in on community fears about SARS by exaggerating the health benefits of surgical masks could face fines of up to
$110,000.

NSW Fair Trading Minister Reba Meagher yesterday warned that
distributors and traders could be prosecuted if it was suggested the
masks offered unrealistic levels of protection from the disease.

"I’m sure everyone would agree that it is un-Australian to profiteer

Apparently, government thinks it is now the Australian Way to profit off

# E mRNA

Given that there has never been a successful vaccine for a respiratory coronavirus, it is difficult to imagine that anyone in government truely believed
that the holy grail of science had been achieved exactly when needed. Indeed,
we know the existing flu vaccine isn’t that great, and over a decade ago went
through the Tamiflu controversy which we just repeated with Paxlovid. Now we
know that the government knew, before any of the SARS-COV-2 vaccines were
made available to Australians, details about the vaccines that can only mean
it was overselling expectations. It is also apparent that the government knew
there were significant adverse reactions within short order. At best, it is clear
the government did not have enough information to claim the vaccines were
“safe and effective”, and that they were both less effective and had more side
effects than they led the public to believe.

## E.1 Nonclinical Evaluation Report

Extracts from the Nonclinical Evaluation Report by The Therapeutic Goods
Administration, January 2021[18]

There are no distribution and degradation data on the S antigenencoding mRNA.

The government knew that there was no evidence on where the spike protein
went throughout a body.

Antibodies and T cells in monkeys declined quickly over 5 weeks
after the second dose of BNT162b2 (V9), raising concerns over long
term immunity, which will be assessed by clinical studies according
to the Sponsor.

. . .

Short term protection studies, lack of pharmacokinetic data for the
S antigen-encoding mRNA (BNT162b2 V9), suboptimal dosing interval in the repeat dose study, lack of repeat dose toxicity studies in
a second species and genotoxicity studies with the novel excipients,
and lack of studies investigating potential for autoimmune diseases
were noted.

BNT162b2 immunisation also induced proinflammatory cytokines

The government knew that it was likely these vaccines did not provide long
term immunity, and that there was a strong possibility of undesirable side effects
that had not been studied.

One study found that among people who had recovered from COVID19, 100% had S protein-specific CD4+ T cells in the circulation and
70% had S protein-specific CD8+ T cells in the circulation.

The government knew that natural immunity was extremely effective.

No genotoxicity studies were conducted for the vaccine.

. . .

Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted.

. . .

No dedicated immunotoxicity study was conducted.

Given the novel nature of the delivery mechanism, the government not requiring any long term harm studies is extremely concerning, given how quickly
it became aware of side effects (Appendix E.2).

The distribution of LNP-BNT162b2 (V9) mRNA or expressed S protein was not studied.

. . .

The tissue distribution pattern was similar in 100 µg mRNA/animal
dose group as noted above for 50 µg mRNA/animal dose, with
highest distribution into liver, adrenal glands and spleen.

. . .

Slow but significant distribution of lipid nanoparticles from the site
of injection with major uptake into liver.

The government knew it did not understand dosing, and that the vaccine
went all over the body (Table 4-2). Given the government knew that lipid
nanoparticles remained in high concentration in certain organs after 48 hours,
it isn’t clear why longer term testing was not required. Surely we’d want to know
how long it takes the liver to clear them out, or why the concentration in the
ovaries kept growing?

In several of the sections describing tests done, the government relies on
historical controls despite this being a radically new delivery mechanism. This

## E.2 Vaccine Safety Surveillance

Extracts from the Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance - Annual Report 2021[19]

The number of AEFI reported to WAVSS was significantly higher
in 2021 than in previous years (10,726 compared with an average of
276 per year for the 2017-2020 period) due to the introduction of
the COVID-19 vaccination program. To allow comparison of AEFI
numbers to previous years, Figure 2 presents all AEFI reported
to WAVSS for persons vaccinated in 2021, and Figure 3 excludes
adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. The high number
of reports in 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination reflects higher
uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, and high engagement from the
public and health care providers with the monitoring of vaccine
safety.

A summary of the number of vaccines administered in 2021, the
number of adverse events reported, and the rates of adverse events
is provided in Table 14.
