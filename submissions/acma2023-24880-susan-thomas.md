**THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT**

**TOPIC …. Misinformation Disinformation ……. proposed BILL**

Australia has always been a democracy allowing people to have their say and opinion on any subject.

Your proposed Bill to restrict our rights to express a difference of opinion would destroy our
Australian democracy as we know it.

Who is to say that an individual’s comments are incorrect.

Who is to say that your chosen fact checkers are correct.

There has been plenty of so-called experts that have gotten it wrong over the years.

I am now a retired senior after successfully running my own manufacturing business for 30 years and
employing many people over those years.

Its about time this country had a few fair debates or am I talking about a Royal Commission!

Especially the overreach and mis handling of the Covid lockdowns and the INCORRECT
**Misinformation the government was issuing regarding the vaccines being safe, effective and not**
transferrable once injected. That turned out to be a complete, may I say, MISINFORMATION !! by
your so-called experts.

This is Australia, a democracy, the country my father fought for .

Lest We Will NEVER Forget

Yours Truly

Senior Taxpayer
