Why do we need this legislation?

Events over the past 3 years saw the unprecedented censoring, deplatforming and villification of
many well credentialed people for speaking their truth. A truth which did not align with that coming
from the governments and authorities. Observing these processes would indicate that the
government and authorities already have considerable power to curtail content deemed to be a
"danger" to Austrralians. It should also be noted that over the passage of time many of the views
expressed by these people have since been proven closer to the truth than the official narrative. Has
this ever been acknowledged?

So why this legislation and why now?

What exactly is disinformation and misinformation? What constitutes harm and to whom? These are
generic terms which can, with a very broad sweep of the conceptual landscape be adapted at the
convenience of the governing bodies to cover what could be a limitless, endless set of scenarios.
Are these terms adequately defined to ensure that they are very clear and they can not be morphed
when an inconvenient scenario arises. Who defines these terms and who then assesses any
particular communication and has the knowledge and understanding to label it thus?

We should be conscious of the fact that governments, institutions and companies are only the front
for the group of people who work under that entity banner. All these entities are made up of people men and women. Just like all of us, these men and women are subject to bribery, coercion, extortion
and their own personal biases and limits as well as other influences. The entity that shields these
people is rarely held accountable and very few people behind the entity who make the decisions are
likewise held accountable.

Autralia is a signatory to the Universal Delaration of Human Rights. A quick internet search on this
topic comes up with this statement:

Australia promotes and protects human rights at home and abroad. Australia's commitment to
human rights is enduring: we were an original signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human
**Rights in 1948. We have been a leading proponent of its consistent and comprehensive**
implementation.

Article 19 of this document is specific to the freedom of speech as follows:

**Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold**
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers.

It would seem that Australia no longer subscribes to the priniples of this document.
If this legislation passes will the governent be announcing to the Australian people they serve and
also the world at large that Australia no longer supports or adheres to Universal Delaration of
Human Rights?

Even more concerning is that mainstream media, the government and other authoriites will not be
bound by the same rules. Why not?

If the people who are acting behind the current and proposed entities and authorities want to shine
the light on what is deemed misinformation and disinformation maybe they should turn the mirror
around to face themselves and reflect on whether or not they are totally innocent in this respect.

We all grow and learn at different rates. And yes we can state and believe something at one stage of
our growth and development that with further experience and thought we may no longer believe or
would support. The only way that we can all grow is to have healthy, transparent and an unimpeded
debate. Obviously within the parameters of courtesy, respect and tolerance. We need to be free to
express our truth without " fear or favour" and have it listened to and assessed on its merits. Healthy
debate with the goal of reaching the highest truth possible promotes progress. Clear sighted
witnessing and assessment of outcomes of decisions also stimulates progress and change.

This proposed legislation has many concerning and disturbing aspects and appears to be
unnecessary.
