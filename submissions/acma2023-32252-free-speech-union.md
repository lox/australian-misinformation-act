**Submission: new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation**

Please find enclosed the submission by the Free Speech Union of Australia (FSU) in
response to the consultation on the new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation.

The FSU is a non-partisan organisation established in order to promote the fundamental
human right of Freedom of Speech within Australia. We defend, protect and promote the
Free Speech rights of all Australians irrespective of the content of the speech.

The FSU strongly objects to the passing of the Communications Legislation Amendment
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill) into law, primarily due to_
the impact it will have upon Free Speech by encouraging censorship and by impeding
innovation in the online media space.

We recommend that the attempt to regulate misinformation and disinformation is abandoned
in its entirety, but at a minimum this Bill should be amended as follows:

1. The regulation of misinformation should be removed so that unintended sharing of

false information is not captured;

2. The exemptions for media and government sources should be removed;
3. Exemptions that allow individuals to engage in good faith debate and discussion

should be introduced; and

4. A threshold test should be introduced so that new entrants in the media market are

not unduly burdened with this regulation.

If there are any questions in respect to this submission, please direct them to Dara
Macdonald using the details below.

Yours sincerely,

Dara Macdonald
Director of Advocacy, Free Speech Union of Australia

**Misinformation and Disinformation Regulation: Unnecessary, Unjust and Unworkable**

The FSU strongly opposes passing the Communications Legislation Amendment
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 into law. This law is unnecessary,_
encourages the censorship of unorthodox and unpopular ideas, and is unjust in its treatment
of different media sources.

By impinging on the Free Speech of Australians and preventing the new entrants to the
online media landscape this law will have far more negative consequences than positive
ones.

**1. Actions Not Ideas Should Be Regulated**

The first reason for the FSU’s strong opposition to this law, is that it seeks to regulate the
dissemination of ideas.

The FSU disagrees that there is a need to regulate misinformation and disinformation. We
note that ACMA’s report which is asserted to justify these new powers only identifies one
instance of serious harm that is directly and unequivocally caused by misinformation: that of
damage to 5G telecommunications infrastructure. There is a lack of evidence of a significant
increase in harm caused by misinformation and disinformation. Further, all the categories of
‘harm’ that this Bill seeks to prevent by regulating information have existing remedies in law.[1]
To take the example of damage to 5G infrastructure, existing criminal laws in all states
penalise damage to property and as such would address any harm caused in this instance.

With Australia’s sophisticated system of laws already regulating all manner of harmful
actions that people can engage in, we are more protected from ‘misinformation’ and
‘disinformation’ than ever before in history. Action, not information or ideas, is also the
proper place of regulation, firstly because in terms of preventing harm, regulation of actions
is far more effective, and, more importantly in our view, the regulation of information and
ideas will ultimately lead to censorship which is seriously detrimental to Australian
democracy and society .

1 This includes. various state and federal anti-vilification laws, such as the Racial Discrimination Act
1975 which already prevents “hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity,
nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability”, state-based
summary offences which already prevent harm caused by the “disruption of public order or society in
Australia”, whilst offences under various state and federal laws such as the Commonwealth Electoral
_Act 1918 already prevent “harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or “of_
Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions. Existing state and federal
environmental laws already make it illegal to harm the environment, and economic harm of all kinds is
captured under various laws including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010

**2. This Law Encourages Censorship**

The primary reason for the FSU’s opposition to this Bill is that it encourages and promotes
censorship. It does this by compelling digital platforms to create a means to identify and
remove misinformation and disinformation, which will inevitably require them to make a
determination as to the truth of information.[2] This is a technologically and practically
challenging task which will mean that the digital platforms will need to use heuristics (or
assumptions that may not be completely accurate) to determine whether information is ‘true’
or not. The problem with using assumptions such as the “orthodox understanding is true” is
that it will invariably mean important information will be censored because it does not fit
within the heuristic that the platforms are using.

The COVID-19 pandemic provided ample examples of the danger of determining truth by
orthodoxy (or what the official information was at the time). There were many instances of
social media platforms removing or shadow banning information from prominent scientists
for disagreeing with the dominant theory or narrative, but in many cases the theories that
were removed from social media platforms as misinformation soon became the dominant
theory or vindicated as correct.

Removing information that contradicts the government or official narrative is most
concerning, not least because it prevents course correction where the position taken by an
authority is wrong. It undermines the quality of decision making and diminishes public trust.

The social media giants have also been known to remove accounts and information based
on the popular narrative within the company in question. Given that these companies are
mostly headquartered in the US, this has led to an increased dominance of American ideas
and discourse in Australia.[3] One unfortunate example of this is the Twitter ban placed on
Australian Associate Professor Holly Lawford-Smith for challenging the idea that being a
woman is an identity unrelated to biological sex.[4] This idea is a subject for intense and
legitimate debate in much of the world and particularly by feminists that are concerned about
the erasure of sex-based rights. The removal of feminists like Lawford-Smith is an
intervention by the big tech platforms that unfairly favours one side of a contentious issue
that requires legitimate public debate.

By judging truth on the prevailing orthodoxy (which is inevitably how they will make such a
determination), digital media platforms will be distorting important public debates by giving

2 We note that the Bill enforces the creation and application of codes that digital platforms must follow
for the identification and removal of misinformation and disinformation, but these codes will likely
leave the determination of factualness to the digital platforms. There is also a risk that ACMA
becomes further involved in the removal of misinformation and disinformation given the powers
contained in Part 3 of the Bill.
3 Existing AI systems have been known to unlawfully discriminate and we can expect that people from
minority groups will be more likely to be censored. For example, indigenous people using particular
terminology e.g. ‘Blak’, ‘Meanjin’, ‘Palawa’, or equally someone who has a disability that impairs
communication, are more likely to be subject to erroneous flagging by an AI system (as it has less
training data to use for these groups and it seems unlikely that US centric tech-companies will trouble
to train their systems to be fair for these groups).
4 We note that some of the actions taken against A/Prof Lawford Smith likely amount to unlawful
discrimination under existing laws including victimisation

preference to “the status quo” over new information or competing ideas. This will likely have
the effect of atrophying our knowledge and limiting access to certain cross-sections of the
public, especially those less connected to existing debates (e.g. people without a University
education).

Free speech is the best corrective mechanism we have to ensure that what the ideas we
hold are correct: ‘more speech’ has been long known to be the answer. By encouraging
censorship this Bill will not improve people's access to information but rather it will limit it and
make it more difficult to update our understanding of the world where the prevailing narrative
is incorrect. For this reason, the FSU believes that the introduction of this law is more
dangerous than any of the ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ it is apparently concerned
with. In fact, we consider that it is a recipe for fuelling misinformation and disinformation,
contrary to the stated objective of this proposed law.

**3. This Law is Unjust in its Treatment of New Entrants to the Media Market and**

**Undermines Technological Innovation**

If passed, this Bill will not only prevent the main mechanism for updating our understanding
of the world from functioning: free speech. It also prevents the dynamism required to update
our institutions, risking the ossification of Australian society.

One of the most egregious aspects of this Bill is the preferential treatment it offers to legacy
institutions and existing media organisations by exempting them from these regulations,
whilst simultaneously heavily regulating new entrants to the media landscape. It is unfair for
regulation to treat new technologies and media business models differentially to existing
media and platforms.

Consider the example of Substack, a new platform that has been an important source of
income and independence for many writers and journalists. Substack will be caught twice by
this law. Firstly, because it will be regulated as a digital platform it will have to ensure that
any content that appears on Substack is not misinformation. Monitoring all of the posts,
videos, podcasts released on Substack and any user comments on any content for
misinformation and disinformation will be an incredibly costly exercise. Secondly, anything
shared from Substack to another digital platform (like Twitter, now called “X”) will also be
caught by this regulation. This increases the risk that either platform will deem the
information contained in a Substack post to be misinformation and censor it from the
Australian audience - at the very least - if not remove it entirely and block the account that it
was shared from.

This Bill places a considerable burden upon new entrants to the media landscape and given
the size of the Australian market, many may simply choose not to operate in Australia, which
will only serve to disadvantage Australians by depriving them of new media sources and
preventing innovation in the digital platform space.

**4. Regulating Misinformation and Disinformation is a Futile Exercise**

This proposed regulation is already not able to contend with the technology that exists to
enable people to access the vast array of information contained on the internet. This lag
between the law and the technology may ultimately render it futile.

If this Bill is passed, existing platforms that are designed to respect free speech and privacy
(such as DuckDuckGo) may simply decide not to operate in the Australian market rather
than comply with the requirements to collect information on Australians and censor their
content.[5] This is particularly likely given that leaving the Australian market will not prevent
Australians from unofficially accessing these platforms.

If Australians cannot access the information and platforms that they currently do on the open
web, this will merely encourage the use of technology like VPNs. Some platforms may even
reconfigure themselves to circumvent the laws so that they are classified as private
messaging or email rather than a digital platform, which would not be a difficult adjustment
for many.[6]

The reality is that existing technology already allows for the easy circumvention of this
proposed regulation by end users. If people want to access information that is classified as
misinformation or disinformation there are ample opportunities for them to do so, irrespective
of if this Bill is passed. This Bill - as is inevitable from what it attempts to do - simply amounts
to red tape for digital businesses, making it less economically viable for them to operate in
Australia.

**5. Recommendations**

The FSU opposes the entirety of this law and recommends that it is not passed for the
reasons we have already provided. However, if this law is to be passed, then at a minimum
the following amendments should be made.

**a) Remove the regulation of misinformation**

The regulation of misinformation should be removed from this Bill. There is an
argument for regulating information that is intended to mislead or deceive people, but
‘misinformation’, which the Bill defines as “content [that] contains information that is
false, misleading or deceptive” that is shared without intent to mislead, should not be
regulated. The category of ‘misinformation’ creates far too much scope for digital
platforms to classify genuinely held opinions expressed about controversial issues of
significant public debate as misinformation and censor it.

5 It is impossible to comply with the EU GDPR and the ‘misinformation’ Bill simultaneously: it still
captures a range of personal information (such as unpublished posts removed for ‘misinformation’
purposes) and proposes to process this arbitrarily and unfairly.
6 The risk is that organisations actually attempt to comply with it, which involves reacting to rapidly
introduced ‘codes’, and by doing so, introduce errors and bugs that inadvertently expose personal
information and increase the likelihood of successful cyberattacks


-----

**b) Remove exemptions for media and Government sources**

Sources of information should be treated equally with no preference given to existing
information institutions. By exempting government and mainstream media sources
and regulating other sources, the proposed legislation unreasonably hampers the
criticism of these institutions as well as impeding the introduction of new media
platforms. For this reason, exemptions should not be granted based on the publisher
of the information but based on the merits of the content.

**c) Introduce exemptions for individuals**

The FSU would suggest amending this Bill, so there are exemptions individuals can
rely on when engaging in good faith discussion and debate, much like existing
defences in defamation law. This would better protect whistle-blowers, academics,
independent journalists and others who disseminate important information that may
be contrary to prevailing views and ideas. This would also encourage digital
platforms to implement proper due process, which allows individuals and
organisations to contend the classification of anything they publish as misinformation.

**d) Introduce a threshold test**

Introduce a threshold test (for instance, less than 5 million Australian uses or less
than $100 million annual worldwide revenue) for compliance with this law that allows
new and smaller media companies and digital platforms to start up and operate in
Australia without being hampered by the prohibitive compliance costs. Media and
communications platforms with fewer Australian-based users also represent a
significantly reduced risk for spreading misinformation and disinformation, so it is
reasonable that they would also be exempted on this basis.
