Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am as an educator deeply concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the
internet can be used to promote all kinds of information, some of which is untrue. But the answer is not to make the
government the arbiter of truth and to censor those it disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The
exposure of bad ideas with an open critique of those bad ideas is the only way the truth can prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience.
Our nation had it right all along. The proposed bill will not strengthen our democracy but weaken it. Being told what
you are allowed to think and say sows the seeds of rebellion not social cohesion.

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some
governments today willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and
its version of truth is the supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want
to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal. It is not in the best interests of the citizens of Australia.
