     Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications
      and the Arts
     Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
     Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023
     Dear Sir/Madam,
     I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed
     Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
     Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen and a passionate advocate
     for free speech and democratic principles, I firmly believe that this bill is
      not only unnecessary but also poses a grave threat to our fundamental rights
      and values.
     One of the most disheartening aspects of this bill is the assumption that
     ordinary people are incapable of engaging in public discourse without causing
      harm. By categorizing viewpoints held by ordinary individuals as misinformation
     or disinformation, the bill undermines the principles of free expression and
     discourages citizen participation in the public conversation. This leads to a
     sense of disillusionment and loss of faith in the democratic process.
     Furthermore, the bill unfairly targets digital platform providers and ordinary
      users by subjecting them to severe threats and penalties. The threats posed to
     digital platform providers, including reputational damage, financial penalties,
      and business inefficiencies, can result in significant financial loss or even
     insolvency. This not only stifles innovation and entrepreneurship but also
     disproportionately impacts smaller businesses and startups.
     Equally concerning is the threat of hauling ordinary citizens before regulatory
      bodies like ACMA for alleged dissemination of mis or disinformation. This is a
     clear case of punishment for having different opinion and the expression of that
     opinion, which is supposed to be protected by our constitution. Such an
     approach is
     reminiscent of oppressive regimes and is contrary to the spirit of mateship, a
     cherished Australian value.
     Additionally, this legislation undermines the essential role of the media in a
     democratic society. Placing reporting standards on independent media
     organizations, journalists, and bloggers, while exempting government-approved
     publications, creates an unfair environment that stifles independent voices. By
     incentivizing favorable news coverage and perspectives aligned with the
     government's agenda, the bill compromises the impartiality and integrity of
     journalism.
     Moreover, the bill's classification of citizens into two categories, with
     government-approved entities enjoying exemption from monitoring while others
     are targeted, is inherently discriminatory and problematic. It infringes upon
     our right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and expression, as
     enshrined in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and our own
     democratic values. The categorization of different faith worldviews as
     misinformation is not only intolerant, but it erodes the rich diversity of
      beliefs that makes Australia a multicultural and inclusive society.

     The ACMA report itself raises many questions. For example, ACMA report claims
     that "Australian mobile carriers incur millions in unforeseen costs directly
     due to online misinformation". In the same section, report says "The largest
     cost category was the repair or replacement of damaged property as a result of
      arson or vandalism attacks at mobile sites". How comes it to be that arson
     or vandalism attacks by a particular person transform into "direct results of
     misinformation"?
      In my opinion, the specific vandal is solely responsible for the damages they
     cause, and such action has nothing
     to do with "misinformation".
      In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department to reconsider the proposed
     Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
     Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is crucial to preserve the principles of free
     speech, democratic governance, and respect for diverse opinions that form the
     foundation of our society. I believe that instead of suppressing viewpoints and
     imposing threats and penalties, the focus should be on promoting media
     literacy, critical thinking, and fostering inclusive public dialogue.
     Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will give due regard
     to the concerns expressed by many Australians who value our democratic ideal
      and the freedom to express our opinions.
     Yours sincerely,

```
