Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am a high school teacher with over 30 years of experience. I have always encouraged my students to be critical
thinkers and not accept “face value” each and every time. The bill you are proposing is the antithesis of what we do
every day in the classroom. You people need to realize you are elected by the people and for the people, you are not
a solo act. We have a close friend who is Chinese and her response to this proposed bill was telling. She said ‘if this
bill is passed you will be just like China where the government controls everything’. That is a sickening thought!

The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian people that it
distrusts the public but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is
undemocratic and will prove devastating for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that
responsibility away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its
citizens from ideas. Australians must exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them.

We are all prone to making mistakes. No one is able to be the sole source of truth, most definitely not a group of
unelected bureaucrats in Canberra. The thought that an unelected body has that level of discernment is a joke.

This bill should be laughed out of existence.
