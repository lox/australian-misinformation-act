# It is never the virtuous who censor information.

Thus far, many of us have been repeatedly been censored on “Facebook” for sharing information that
has now been proven to be truth. Indeed, the difference between “conspiracy theory” and truth is
six months and dropping.  The first information Facebook censored for me, was written by a worldrenowned Australian Professor. That ‘misinformation” has now been proven to be truth.

As per his Western Australian speech in parliament, Minister Dr Brian Walker, suffered myocarditis as
a side effect of his Covid Vaccination, and he strongly implied that Shane Warne died as a result of his
Covid Vaccination.

The censoring of information is a clear attempt to hide debate and truth., such as: 
- “Is THE VOICE” an under-handed land grab? OR

- Why has a known World Economic Forum operative set himself up as a type of native elder over the
past 3 decades?

- Why is he saying his people will be in-charge of the planet in by the end of 2023?

- What does the WHO Pandemic Treaty really involve.?

Censoring of information is a clear indication that people involved in criminal activities do not wish to
be exposed.

You need to keep in mind that TRUTH has ways of coming to the surface, and lies have ways of
backfiring that we never expected.

Also, there is no statute of limitations for charges for: 
_“Murder or collusion with murder and charges of inflicting bodily harm or collusion with_
_infliction bodily harm” which at this time those censoring vaccine information are guilty of._

Censoring of information such as statistics Minister Dr Brian Walker exposed, including that the TGA
is 96% big pharma funded, is not going unnoticed.

**The WHO is similarly highly funded by “big Pharma”.  Censoring of information provides clear**
**evidence of collusion with criminal behaviour, and we do expect all those responsible, by way of**
**voting or omitting to speak out against censoring will be held to account.**
