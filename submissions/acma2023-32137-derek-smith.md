# SUBMISSION AGAINST the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 by Derek Smith,
 The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act, Common and Equity Law provide for the Freedom and other Rights and Interests of Australians.
 Australians do not need ACMA or any other Government entity to think for them.
 Australians need to be protected from the Misinformation and Disinformation of the Parliaments in Australia including in respect of the following

 1. Human induced climate change 2. Oil and Gas being fossil fuels. 3. Solar energy (wind turbines, solar panels and batteries) is clean, green
 and economic compared to coal fired electricity power stations.
 4. Vaccines are safe and not killing Australians. 5. The Nuremberg Code not applying to Medical procedures, etc. 6. Constitution 51/23 A, not applying to Medical procedures, etc., 7. Coal fired powered stations not being clean, green and sustainable. 8. That the Aborigines are the first settlers on this Continent 9. That the Aborigines have been a Nation. 10. Etc. anything that is against their fictional narrative.

 For your education please see the following 

 1. Human induced climate change. This is an invention of the Oil and Gas Industry who think they control the World. When CO2 is pumped down their Oil and Gas wells more oil and gas is recovered. The philosophy of this industry is that they do not pay for raw product. So, they had to find a way of having someone pay for the extraction and transport of CO2 to their Oil and Gas wells. They funded the UN department of the environment to first promote human induced Global Warming and when the science disproved this they changed it to human induced Climate Change. So, electricity consumers are paying for the CO2 for the Oil and Gas industry, further supporting their belief that they control the World.

# 2. Oil and Gas being fossil fuels. During WW ll Hitler cut off energy supplies to Russia and some 28 million Russians citizens died. After the War, Stalin vowed that never again would the Russian People be held captive to another Country for energy. He had two separate Research Labs set up to find everything there is to know about Oil, so that it could be made in factories. Both Labs tried to reverse engineer Oil on the basis that it is a fossil fuel. What they independently discovered is that it is not a fossil fuel but occurs naturally in the crust of the Earth. From this research, the components of Oil became known and the pressures and temperatures necessary to bring these components together to create Oil. This identified the Geology that could result in Oil and Gas. In 1957 Russian launched Sputnik 1 the earth’s first artificial satellite. Subsequent satellites were used to identify the Geology for Oil and Gas. The Russian drilled the identified Geological sites and developed deep well drilling to discover vast quantities of Oil and Gas. Subsequently, Western Researchers have confirmed the Russians findings. Oil and Gas are not fossil fuels.

 3. Solar energy (wind turbines, solar panels and batteries) is clean, green and economic compared to coal fired electricity power stations. To sell this fiction to Australians and People around the World, CO2 had to be branded a pollutant of the Atmosphere causing Climate Change. This then identified coal as a major cause of Climate Change. Coal being black seemed to connect the dots in the minds of the uneducated. Here are some irrefutable facts – 

 • Around a coal fired electricity power station, that does not have CO2
 extractors in its chimneys, the vegetation grows at more than twice the rate as the same vegetation away from the station. It has been reported that in South Africa small crops are grown around their coal fired electricity power station with the CO2 free to the small crop producers. (Note CO2 is pumped into Green Houses to increase crop growth, production and profits)

 • NASA reported that over a10 year period in Communist China the
 vegetation had grown many times faster than elsewhere in the World due to the high level of CO2 emissions from their 1,000 plus Coal Fired Electricity Power Stations.

 • A hectare of pasture can sequestrate 4 time more CO2 than a hectare of
 trees.

 • Without the current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, grain production
 would be significantly reduced causing famine around the World. Above a field of corn, all of the CO2 is sequestrated to grow the corn.

# • Since 2000, Government subsidies of Solar Energy Wind Turbines, and Solar
 Panels and Batteries have escalated electricity prices. The increase in real prices after June 2012 of around 14% for household electricity and 13% for household gas is associated with the implementation of a carbon price from July 2013. In real terms—that is, taking into account the general increase in prices across all goods and services—prices for households increased on average by 72% for electricity and 54% for gas in the 10 years to June 2013.  In the last decade, electricity prices have doubled or close to doubled for many consumers, according to the Tariff Tracking project.

 4. Vaccines are safe and not killing Australians. Ethical doctors, hospitals, undertakers and life insurance companies have the factual data to prove these Vaccines are not safe and are destroying the lives of Australians including by death.

 5. The Nuremberg Code not applying to Medical procedures, etc. 

**BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL No 7070 Volume 313: Page 1448,**
**7 December 1996.**

**Introduction**
The judgment by the war crimes tribunal at Nuremberg laid down 10 standards to
which physicians must conform when carrying out experiments on human subjects in
a new code that is now accepted worldwide.

This judgment established a new standard of ethical medical behaviour for the post
World War II human rights era. Amongst other requirements, this document
enunciates the requirement of voluntary informed consent of the human subject. The
principle of voluntary informed consent protects the right of the individual to control
his own body.

This code also recognizes that the risk must be weighed against the expected
benefit, and that unnecessary pain and suffering must be avoided.

This code recognizes that doctors should avoid actions that injure human patients.

The principles established by this code for medical practice now have been extended
into general codes of medical ethics.

**The Nuremberg Code (1947)**

**Permissible Medical Experiments**
The great weight of the evidence before us to effect that certain types of medical
experiments on human beings, when kept within reasonably well-defined bounds,
conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally. The protagonists of the
practice of human experimentation justify their views on the basis that such
experiments yield results for the good of society that are unprocurable by other
methods or means of study. All agree, however, that certain basic principles must
be observed in order to satisfy moral, ethical and legal concepts:

1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This

means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent;
should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without
the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching,
or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient
knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved
as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This
latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision
by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature,
duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is
to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected;
and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his
participation in the experiment.

The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests
upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is

# • All Parliaments in Australia are in contempt and individuals face being put
 before International Human Rights and or Military Tribunals.


-----

# 6. Constitution 51/23 A, not applying to Medical procedures, etc. Individuals face the same outcomes as in (5).

 7. Coal fired powered stations not being clean, green and sustainable.

 • In Mongolia, there are two 90 metre coal seams. Botanists and Geologists
 acknowledge that these 90 metre seams cannot be from fossils.

 • Around the Planet there are coal seams with vertical standing trees through
 the coal seams.

 • The Geological evidence is that coal is not a fossil fuel but naturally occurs
 in the crust of Planet Earth.

 • In a new generation, high-tech coal fired electricity power station there is no
 pollution to harm the environment.

 • Coal is clean, green and sustainable.

 8. That the Aborigines are the first settlers on this Continent

 • The aborigines we know today were not the first settlers of the Continent,
 Oceans and Island we know as Australia. I have seen cave paintings in the Kimberly WA of a people who are not the aborigines we know. These paintings are known as the Bradshaw Paintings.
 The remote coastline of north western Australia was probably the first landing site on this continent, as groups crossed by boat from Timor some 60,000 years ago. At some point, these groups began to decorate the rocks with a variety of rock art.

 • I have seen research which says that today’s Aborigines are the 10th settlers
 of Australia.

# 9. That the Aborigines have been a Nation.

 • When the British landed to settle and assimilate, there were 300 or more separate tribes of Aborigines each speaking a different language spread across the Continent and Islands. There was NO Nation with which the British could negotiate a Treaty.


-----

# • When the British settled Australia they brought with them the Military to
 keep law and order between the Aborigines and European People. Inevitable there were killings on both sides. 

 • At the time of the Gold Rush 40,000 Chinese came to Australia, did not
 speak Australian and did not assimilate with the other miners. They moved


-----

# around the mine sites giving the impression to the mainly European Community of a Chinese invasion. The Governors of the Colonial States meet to agree on stopping immigration from China but South Australia would not agree because that wanted Chinese for the Northern Territory which they managed. The others Governors knew that the Chinese already entering SA moved across the borders into the other States and this could not be stopped.

 • The Colonial State Governors asked the British Government “what to do”
 and they were advised to Federate as the Commonwealth of Australia under a Constitution approved by the People. A Commonwealth of Australia Parliament could then legislate to control immigration.

 • The founding fathers took 10 years to put together a brilliant Constitution
 which every Australians should know.

 • Referendums were held in each Colonial State and in some States,
 Aborigines and Women voted in the Referendums. Note: In Britain women, over 30 who were either a member or married to a member of the Local Government Register got the Vote in 1918. Australia was way ahead of the times in Europe.

 • The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act was passed by
 the British Parliament. This Act created the Nation Australia and gave the People their identity as Australians. The Constitution is silent of Race, Religion and Colour and inclusive of all people including the Aborigines. Britain is not a foreign power. Britain and Australia are two inseparable Nations.

 • So that the Constitution would exist in perpetuity it is constituted as an
 Incorporated Entity in which each Australia including the Aborigines hold one share and the British Crown holds one share so that we are all equal.

 10. Etc. anything that is against their fictional narrative.

 • Australia is not Hitler’s Nazi Germany
 • Australia is not Communist.
 • Australia’s Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act and
 Common and Equity Law give each and every Australian the right to VOTE as they see fit and not as directed by the ACMA or Government.

 • Australia is an all-inclusive People who love Freedom. NO Choice, NO
 Freedom, NO Democracy. 


-----

# • Australians are FREE to choose what to believe and what to reject, they do
 not need ACMA or Government to decide for them.

 • The Parliaments are the creators of fiction. The People need protection from
 the Parliaments i.e. Government of the People, by the People, for the People.
