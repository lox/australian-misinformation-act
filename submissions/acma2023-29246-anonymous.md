# Submission to be made public. 

Preamble:
This is the second submission I have made to the Australian Government, the former
several years ago to an agency with the same activities but probably a different name,
with the previous feedback the department went outside of the submission process
engaged with "stakeholder" entities after the submission process had closed and
screwed the Australian public. I found the behaviour of this/that Department
deceiving and believe that this submission process as a smokescreen to what the
government wants to achieve. Your bureaucrats have proven this with the previous
submission process, we the people were not invited to make any further submissions
to address the further "stakeholder" submission/discussions.  Most likely this will
occur again if not already discussed.

The previous three years have been very interesting, I am one of the 20% of the
critical thinkers in our society.

After the start of the "pandemic" and the attack from media and the government on
the critical thinkers type discussions, and yes I have a FOI with the Department
of Home Affairs which is currently overdue by 30 days for a response regarding my
facebook posts and comments. There is/was a narrative being pushed by the
government and things outside of the narrative were squashed. ( some doctors and
medical professional were also squashed)

In 2020 I came to a conclusion that in three or four years after the start of the
"pandemic" the proof would come as death rate statics and at this point in time excess
deaths are running at around 17% above the 5 year averages before 2019 however the
Australian Government is completely silent regarding these excess deaths.

The so called conspiracy theorist's, Lab Leak, Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine,
Experimental vaccines (Vaccine injuries), man made virus, social exclusion issues,
financial issues, unsafe and ineffective vaccines were all played down by the
government even some Australian Government Politician's were censored on the
advice of government bureaucrats.

Both authoritarian and democratic governments had made more legal changes on this
front of Misinformation and Disinformation laws in 2020 than in 2019. And in


-----

authoritarian states, pandemic-related misinformation has provided a new justification
for repressive policies.

Is Australia democratically or Authoritarian governed? The shooting of mainly
peaceful protesters with rubber bullets and beanbag projectiles (also at a Shrine),
indiscriminate use of capsicum spray, being questioned why a person is taking a boat
out onto a bay, the politicisation of the police force, people with anti government
tendencies mysteriously end up with a bullet in their head. The right to protest
removed, Human rights violations, the use of so called "LRAD" devices on peaceful
protesters with the possibility of a microwave type device deployed, violations
regarding incitement, incite to "protest", Incitement should be reserved for lets say
more serious things such as incite to murder, but no not anymore you can be arrested
for inciting people to attend a peaceful protest.

So where does that leave Australia democratically or Authoritarian governed, the past
three years have shown us how quickly an Authoritarian system can be put in place in
a so called democratically elected country like Australia.

under section 2 Definitions, of the exposure draft it is stated,

**_excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the following:_**
(a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or
satire;

(b) professional news content;
(c) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited by any of
the following:
(i) the Commonwealth;
(ii) a State;
(iii) a Territory;
(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as an
accreditor of educational institutions;
(d) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited:
(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a foreign
government as an accreditor of educational institutions; and
(ii) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable Australian
educational institution;

(e) content that is authorised by:

(i) the Commonwealth; or

(ii) a State; or

(iii) a Territory; or

(iv) a local government

Why have the mainstream (professional) media been excluded from this Act at (b),
and also the Crown and Local government at (e).

I have not given consideration to (c), (d).

For example during the past 3 years we were told by the Government, mainstream
media and many other influential persons about the vaccines being safe and effective
and would prevent you getting the virus and stop the transmission of the virus.

Another example, I have contacted both the Governor General and the Attorney
General regarding the title of our sovereign, King of Australia. Queen of Australia
was made by legislation, as the constitution has the title of the sovereign contained
within. With the king being the new sovereign of Australia the wording for the
proclamation was made by the Australia Government as advised by the GG, after
contact with the office of the AG, I was advised that King of Australia is generally
accepted as the title of the new sovereign. This must be some type of spin doctor
rubbish because it is legislation that enabled the Sovereign to be call Queen of
Australia, no such legislation exists for the King and our constitution provides the title
of the new King.

I have made posts on Facebook regarding this which have been censored, by what
means it is unknown maybe the FOI will shed some light on this matter, who knows??

It is as plain as the nose on my face is that our constitution must be honoured,
however to take this matter to the high court is not within my financial means. It has
huge ramifications if I am correct as the Judicial is sworn in to the King Of Australia
our court system and our government systems are currently being compromised. The
comment from the Principle Legal Officer, Office of Constitutional Law that stated
" it is generally accepted " is very worrying, perhaps it is just the government
narrative again.

And another example more recently regarding the Voice to Parliament, the Prime
minister has been recorded as saying the Uluru Statement from the heart fits on an A4
page, Sky News has just provided information that the Uluru statement from the heart
is 23 pages long. A quick search on the internet only reveals that the1 page is
available, why wouldn't the whole 23 pages be revealed since this is the basis of going
to a referendum.
The government hasn't even set a date for the referendum yet, is the government
waiting to get this legislation in place before setting a date then censoring the
information available!!!!!

What happens to the other 22 pages of information in the Uluru Statement from the
heart would that be deemed mis/dis information???

Lets talk about safe and although the Government is very silent on the excess deaths
currently occurring in Australia, this drug was novel, unproven, no empirical data and
experimental but we are told that it is "safe" further more it is what I call a god drug,
plays with DNA. we are now seeing an increase in heart related problems, turbo
cancer, autoimmune issues and perhaps many more issues in the future.

Effective but does not stop you from getting or transmitting the virus. If this was a
product for sale in Australia it would be returned due to not performing to the
standard we were told it would.


-----

Somehow a narrative was developed and information outside the narrative would be
shutdown. We have already a glimpse into how the Government manages a narrative
thru the Twitter files being released, and information from the Meta company,
Basically the spy apparatus of the government on behalf of the health department and
using a third party information gathering entity then contacts the social media
organisation to review said content and if it doesn't need the necessary requirement it
is restricted/removed/less views by the social media company. Somehow we are to
believe that I also have the same ability to effect the same scrutiny, I don't think so,
firstly I don't have an email address for any personnel working for social media
companies. An individual can not exert the same influence as the Government when
dealing with social media companies, it has also been noted that the USA government
definitely exerted influence over the social media companies.

If this legislation is carried forward the crown must by subject to this legislation and
including professional media outlets.

Who is the keeper of the truth? fact checking teams, will the Government deem
certain things as Mis/Dis information, the past 3 years have shown us how a narrative
was developed and enforced

Will freedom of speech be restricted? Yes even AMCA has stated this. Are we living
in a democracy or under the veil of an Authoritarian system.

Stick this bill in the bin!!!!!!!

End of submission
