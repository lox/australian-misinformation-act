To Whom It May Concern

**RE Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**

**2023**

Thank-you for seeking my views on the titled exposure draft (ED) Bill. My views are as follows:

# General

1. Whilst it is commendable that the government, with support of mainstream media, is

seeking to protect impressionable and non-critical thinkers, it is dangerous to give the
government or its agencies the responsibility to corral information and get rid of anything
that is not safe.

2. I understand why the government might want to clamp down on some information – there

are some wacky ideas out there that have gotten traction with wide sections of the public
and led to poor outcomes. It seems that the intent of the bill is that, for the public good, and
the well being of the community, wacky ideas (aka misinformation and disinformation) are
best stifled, so as people are not lead astray e.g. bad heath choices, poor voting decisions,
harmful views leading to self harm etc. etc.

However…

3. That the government imagines itself and the mainstream media to be the authority on

matters of truth is laughable. The only difference between Joe Public and an MP and/or his
or her government agencies is that a section of the community voted for him or her.

4. The freedom to speak and broadcast is a bedrock foundation and marker of a truly

democratic society. Progress happens by allowing people to publicly weigh up ideas.

5. To stifle freedom of expression under threat of fine or imprisonment unfortunately paves the

way for a government to govern relatively unopposed, increasing the temptation by it to
bring in laws and health orders etc. that are not in the public’s interest, e.g. that might suit
the political aspirations, leanings and power brokers of the party in power only.

6. It is delusional to imagine that we would be better off not having a range of political,

philosophical, scientific and faith-based ideas in the public square, unless of course the only
ideas permitted are the truthful ones. The issue is: who gets to decide the truth? The world is
littered with examples of censorship, silencing of political opponents, quashing of ideas that
don’t follow the party line. This bill if enacted will have that effect.

7. There always the temptation to control others (their behaviour, decisions, thoughts,

information use, and education, work health and medical choices, votes etc.), especially for
those with the power to do so. It’s easier and faster to govern, it can be safer, it can work out
for the common good. Controlling what can be said or written, e.g. via enactment of a
misinformation bill, is just another form of control. Far healthier is an empowered
community with individual autonomy (i.e. self-control) organised around healthy public
discourse and democratically elected persons to govern and lead on shared concerns


-----

(infrastructure, national defence, international relations, law and order etc.). It may take
longer and be more complex to govern, but ownership of decisions, accountability, checks
and balances, beneficial compromises and discourse-tested ideas ensure the way we are
governed is mostly the way we want to be governed.

8. A recent example of how censorship intended to do good actually caused harm, government

encouraged the public during the pandemic to see one’s trusted GP if one wanted further
information. Unfortunately, I was not able to trust my GP because he had an AHPRA gag
order placed on him in March 2021 not to talk negatively about the vaccines. Neither could
he prescribe ivermectin due to a TGA ban. That was unnecessary information control.

9. An alternative far better approach would be to encourage people to:

a. Be critical thinkers
b. Be responsible when choosing information to consume and how often
c. Judge the motives of the author, publisher and other stakeholders
d. Be trained to detect potential bias
e. Be trained to recognise underlying messages and themes
f. To read and/or listen widely, not just things one agrees with
g. To regularly hold discourse, including with people one disagrees with, and seek to

understand other’s opinions and underlying belief systems, and listen and speak
well, i.e. with kindness, respect and courage.

h. To understand why freedom of expression is important
i. To understand why respectful relationships in family and community are important

j. To accept that people see things differently, and to not allow that to divide

k. To accept people, whether or not one agrees with their beliefs or life choices
l. For some of us, to engage in the public square, media and/or politics.

# Bill Issues

**Part 1 – Introduction**

“ACMA may determine a standard to provide adequate protection for the community from
misinformation or disinformation on digital platform services”

Who is going to define what constitutes “misinformation or disinformation”? Paragraph by paragraph
or post by post or article by article, who gets to decide? What is the consultation process? How will
this be documented? Will documentation be freely available to the public? Will there be a review
period? What are the checks and balances?

**Part 2 – Definitions**

“excluded content for misinformation purposes”, includes:

1. “professional news content.” Wow! So the mainstream media (MSM) will be trusted to only

publish truth, but social media channels will not be? Why does the Government and ACMA
trust MSM? The MSM bias is palpable when reading for example both The Australian and the
_Sydney Morning Herald in tandem. Who decided that MSM was exempted but we are not?_

2. “content produced by or for an educational institution”. Wow! Who decided that our

educational departments do not require misinformation checks but the public does? The
issue is that these people will be able to push a view, but Joe Public will not be able to refute
that view, because they will be “right”. Meanwhile Joe Public will be under threat of fine or
prison.

3. “content that is authorised by: (i) the Commonwealth; or ii) a State; or (iii) a Territory; or (iv)

a local government.” Ditto. Government may be ok now, but please note that in pre-war
Germany, Nazism arose in the context of a democratically elected government.

**Part 7 Misinformation and disinformation**

1. _“dissemination of content using a digital service is misinformation on the digital service if (a)_

_the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive”. Wow! Does the_
government have access to some 100% reliable fact-checking site that guarantees to know
whether something is “false, misleading or deceptive”? That is childish in its naivety. Who
decides what is true?

**Part 60 Implied freedom of political communication**

The section only covers a very limited aspect (i.e. political) of freedom of expression.

**Conclusion**

My key point is: Who gets to decide what is true? The bill should be scrapped.

I trust that you find the above helpful.

Ian Abbott
