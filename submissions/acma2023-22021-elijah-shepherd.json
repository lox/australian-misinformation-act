      "The definition of misinformation is too broad and lacks clarity, as it does not require intent to deceive, unlike disinformation.",
      "The bill could have suppressed discussions during the COVID-19 pandemic that were initially considered conspiracy theories but later deemed probable.",
      "The bill grants excessive power to a government agency, potentially leading to the suppression of free speech.",
      "There is a perceived bias in favor of legacy media institutions over alternative or community-based media outlets."
