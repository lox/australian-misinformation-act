I make the following submission on the ‘Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023:


_Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19_


_“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom_
_to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and_
_ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”_

The free-flow of information, debate, public discourse (in person or by any medium) and the
right to hold individual opinion are all essential to the health of any democratic
society. With the government as the ultimate arbiter of truth, Australia would no longer be
a democracy, but a model of the dystopian "Ministry of Truth" from George Orwell's 1984,
or nations such as North Korea or communist China, where individual thought and action is
harshly stifled.

Who decides what is ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’? All of this is extremely
subjective, and ultimately open to someone else’s interpretation and opinion. Information
that was in the past deemed “misinformation” has proved, with the passing of time, to be
true.

It is telling that the government and mainstream media would be exempt from the rules of
this bill. The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is
blatantly hypocritical.

The definition of harm in the proposed bill is also highly subjective, encompassing anything
deemed hateful, disruptive, or harmful to various aspects such as society, democracy,
environment, and economy. Who decides on this? We seem to have come to a place where
we are unable to express our deeply held opinions in case they ‘offend’ or ‘hurt’ someone
else. This really means that they don’t like what they hear, and want everyone to espouse
their own points of view. However, those with conservative or traditional values are subject
to abuse with no thought to their emotional response. These terms, ‘offend’ or ‘hurt’ are
open to interpretation rather than factual.

This Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication. and will
be misused to shut down legitimate free speech and public debate on pressing social issues,
censor unpopular opinions, and enforce certain 'approved narratives' by the ruling powers
of the time.


Therefore, this Bill should not proceed.
