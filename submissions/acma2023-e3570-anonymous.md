Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am deeply concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. I am shocked to hear that such a Bill
has even been proposed in Australia. The government is not and never will be the arbiter of truth and to censor those
it disagrees with is simply preposterous. This is the death of freedom of speech, the absolute pillar of a democracy.
What will we be left with? Just look across the ocean to find the nation who is the biggest abuser of human rights in
the world, we will be very close to joining them.

I amyears old and I love my Nation. I want to see it continue to be a democracy for my grandchildren and great
grandchildren, this is why I have written this small submission.

This Bill will destroy our Nation and must be opposed and stopped immediately. I ask that you reject this proposal in
its entirety.
