# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
**Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023.**

As a concerned Australian citizen, I am totally opposed to this proposed legislation.

For several reasons

# • As a citizen of a free and democratic country we all have the right of free
speech. Even if this means some may not agree with your opinion.

# • This legislation allows a select politically motivated group to police what is
considered misinformation by populist opinion of the time.

# • I feel there are other avenues in which control of misinformation in the digital
world can be achieved and have been used to some degree of success over
the recent years, without legislating lazy policies that could endanger our
# freedoms in a much wider net than most people are aware of.

 • This legislation is an erosion of our human rights and everything I feel is
Australian. Our concept of a “fair go” is being attacked.

# • Our forefathers have died in numerous wars in the past to protect our right to
enjoy and cherish these freedoms.

# • It is dangerous to allow so much power to a small group of people to
determine what is true or not by their interpretation of select information. This
can easily be abused by a political system to silence any voice opposed to the
political narrative. This not what democracy is about.

# • Far more detail is required as to how this legislation will be enacted and how
Australians can question the results from this “inquisition”

# • It seems very wrong that private businesses and individuals will be policed by
this legislation, but our politicians and their parties will not, along with
# government departs and worst of all mainstream media. How can it have any
creditability?

# • This legislation is dangerously overreaching and has the potential to do
extreme amount of damage to Australia’s reputation. It truly belongs in the bin.

# A very concerned citizen

Yours Truly
