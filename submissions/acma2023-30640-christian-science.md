Re: Exposure Draft
_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill_
_2023_

To Whom It May Concern:

As the appointed representatives of Christian Science in Australia, we submit this letter in response to
the Government’s request for comments on the Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation
_Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the “Bill”). We appreciate the_
objective of this legislation to protect individuals from harmful information disseminated online, as well
as the Government’s decision to solicit public input on a wide variety of issues related to this significant
proposal at such an early stage.

Our comments on the Bill focus on the definition of misinformation and how that definition might be
construed in ways that could inadvertently chill the expression of statements of religious belief made in
good faith. For the reasons detailed below, we would ask that the Government amend the Bill to specify
that the definition of excluded content for misinformation purposes applies to statements of
religious belief that are made in good faith and not in violation of Federal, State, Territory, or local law.

**1. About the Submitters: Background Information About Christian Science**

We are filing this comment in our capacities as Christian Science Committees on Publication, which
means that we have been appointed by branches of our church to ensure that the public (including
Federal and State government officials) have accurate information about Christian Science, its
teachings, and practice.

Christian Science is a religion that is based on the Bible, especially the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.
It was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, USA at the end of the nineteenth century, and has been
practised in Australia for more than a century. Today, there are Christian Science congregations in
approximately sixty (60) countries, including twenty-eight (28) such congregations in Australia.

One of the central teachings of Christian Science is that individuals can experience healing of all kinds
of problems, including those involving health, by developing a clearer understanding of God and one’s
relationship to Her/Him. This is accomplished through daily prayer, Scriptural study, and striving to put
Jesus’ teachings into practice in daily life. Importantly, the Christian Science Church does not dictate
the decisions of its members regarding health care or in any other respect. However, the bylaws of our
church do establish spiritual ministries through which individuals who feel called to serve others receive
education and training to provide spiritual assistance, support, and practical care to those who have
decided that they wish to address health needs through the teachings of Christian Science.

Although adherents of Christian Science are entirely free to make their own decisions, they will
generally turn to prayer rather than conventional medical treatment when they experience problems
with physical or mental health. This is usually because they have found this method to be successful
and reliable.

Generally speaking, in making decisions on matters of health, Christian Scientists are mindful of the
needs of their loved ones and communities, as well as the laws of the land. Most importantly, they
strive to put into practice the Golden Rule to: “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and
Jesus’ instruction to love one another.

**2. Overview of Concerns Relating to the Bill’s Definition of Misinformation**

We approach the Bill from the standpoint of a religious group that holds minority beliefs in certain
respects, but which also has great appreciation for the legal framework administered by our
Government and the motive behind this legislation. We do not take issue with the provisions of the Bill
addressing the dissemination of disinformation (i.e., content produced with deceptive intent) online.
Instead, we wish to raise issues regarding the definition of misinformation and how it might be
construed as presently defined. The Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to state:

dissemination of content using a digital service is misinformation on the digital service if:
(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and
(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes; and
(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in Australia; and
(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute
to serious harm.[1]

Unlike the definition of disinformation, the above definition does not require that the information in
question be disseminated with the intent to deceive. The Bill does not contain any criteria for
determining whether information is “false, misleading, or deceptive,” nor does it specifically identify the
party responsible for making that determination. Given the Bill’s focus on the granting of reserve
powers to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (“ACMA”), we understand that this
determination would be made by digital platform providers unless ACMA determines that there is a
need to make rules either by registering a code made by the industry or making its own standard.[2]

The Bill would also amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to define the term excluded content
**_for misinformation_** **_purposes as follows:_**

(a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire;
(b) professional news content;
(c) content produced by or for an educational institution [that hold certain types of domestic
accreditation];
d) content produced by or for an educational institution [that holds certain types of foreign
accreditation];
(e) content that is authorised by: [the Federal Government, or a State, Territory, or local
government][3]

1 Exposure Draft, p. 12, ll. 5-14.
2 It is our understanding that compliance with a registered code or ACMA standard by digital platform providers
would be compulsory.
3 Exposure Draft, pp. 5-6, ll 11-2.

Notably, nothing in this section would extend the definition to statements of sincerely held religious
belief.

We appreciate the reassurance given in the Guidance Note to the effect that ‘[t]he Bill does not seek to
curtail freedom of speech, nor is it intended that powers will be used to remove individual pieces of
content on a platform’.[4] We also understand that a determination that content is misinformation requires
a finding that it is likely to cause or contribute to serious harm based on a variety of factors that relate,
among other things, to the subject matter, severity of the potential impact, and the reach of the
information.[5] However, the fact that the Bill vests ACMA with reserve powers could potentially
incentivise digital platform providers to demonstrate the effectiveness of their voluntary code of practice
(thereby discounting the need for action by ACMA) by removing content that they either disagree with
or are concerned that others might consider false.

We are therefore concerned that, despite the Government’s stated intent, the provisions of the Bill as
currently drafted have the potential to chill freedom of expression, especially as it may relate to those
who hold minority religious beliefs. For the reasons which follow, we submit that the following change
would contribute to the objectives of the Bill by ensuring that individuals will be able to continue to make
lawful expressions of religious belief in good faith online without being concerned that these will be
deemed “false” and removed.

**3. Request that Lawful Statements of Religious Belief Made in Good Faith Be Excluded from**

**the Definition of Misinformation**

We ask that the Bill be amended to include a reference to lawful statements of religious belief made in
good faith in the definition of excluded content for misinformation purposes Many individuals consider
their religious beliefs to be an integral part of their being and guiding principles by which they seek to
live their lives. We suggest that one’s ability to express one’s religious belief in good faith is at least as
important as the ability to produce content in good faith for entertainment, parody, and satire.

We do not believe that it is the Government’s intent to limit the lawful expression in good faith of
subjective ideas, such as sincerely held religious beliefs. A belief or opinion that one person considers
to be true may be viewed as completely false by someone else, and this contributes to the risk that the
provisions of the Bill as drafted might be misapplied in ways that stifle or limit freedom of expression.[6]

4 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, Guidance
Note, p. 7
5 Exposure Draft, pp. 12-13, ll. 29-12.
6 It is worth noting that the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation at Section 3.6
defines misinformation as ‘Digital Content that is verifiably false or misleading or deceptive’ (emphasis added).
The fact that the industry’s voluntary code of practice provides a more qualified definition of misinformation was
one factor that caused us to question whether the Bill’s definition could be extended to lawful statements of
religious belief made in good faith.

Diversity of opinion and belief is a hallmark of a democratic society, and the expression of diverse
views should be welcomed so long as this is done in a way that is in accordance with law (e.g., not to
incite hatred or violent acts, etc.).

It is our understanding that Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR). Among other things, Article 18, Section 1 of the ICCPR includes within the right to
freedom of thought, conscience, and religion the “freedom, either individually or in community with
others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and
teaching’. Religious beliefs are deeply held and, in our experience, are sometimes misunderstood by
those who do not share them. The ability to manifest one’s religious belief should include the ability to
express that belief publicly without concern that a digital service provider may judge the truth of that
belief and deem it unworthy of a hearing.

We are aware that the right to manifest one’s religion is not without limitation.[7] For that reason, we do
not request an unqualified exclusion from the definition of misinformation for the expression of good
faith religious beliefs. Rather, we ask that such statements be excluded only if they are not made in
violation of Federal, State, or Territory law. This would protect our citizens from illegal conduct done in
the name of (or directed at) religion. It would also provide digital service providers with a clearer test to
apply to determine whether religious content constitutes misinformation. This would mitigate the risk
that content could be removed solely because a digital service provider disagrees with it or has
concerns that others reviewing the information may consider it false.

**4. Conclusion**

Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this important legislation. We ask that the
Government consider making the changes outlined in this letter to ensure that the provisions of this Bill
will not be interpreted and applied in ways that could limit or restrict the lawful expression of religious
beliefs made in good faith. We would also be grateful to be included in any dialogue that the
Government chooses to have about these issues with religious organisations going forward.

Please feel free to be in touch with us if you have questions or can provide any additional information.

Respectfully submitted,

Territory, and Northern Territory

7 Art. 18, § 3 of the ICCPR provides that ‘[f]reedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to
such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others’.
