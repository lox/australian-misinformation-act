Misinformation and Disinformation proposed legislation

Over the past three years, I have become increasingly disenchanted with professional television news
and government information. My preference is to engage with digital platforms, read information,
comment on, and research further if inclined, (which I frequently do). My main problems with the
proposed legislation are dot pointed below:

- who decides information that is false, misleading or deceptive?

META has already acknowledged in court that factcheck is opinion, and RMIT factlab are paid $800 per
fact check. Those who are performing the factchecking are incentivised to find certain information. I
believe debate between credible sources for both sides is needed.

- A definition of what constitutes ‘false, misleading or deceptive' information is also needed. This is an
incredibly vague statement and could be misused.

- The draft legislation lists excluded content for misinformation from government, professional news
sources, accredited education etc. Recent freedom of information sourced by Australian senators have
shown government censorship during the pandemic to be inaccurate as to factual information.  Indeed
the government is currently politicizing the words ‘disinformation and misinformation' so much so that
they are almost a parody of their previous meaning. The exclusion and the ‘parody' don't inspire
confidence or trust. History has shown that both professional news sources and government can be
purveyors of misinformation.

I don't believe ACMA’s corporate vision to ‘build consumer trust in the use of communications, content
and services' will be earned through this legislation. Please respect my ‘freedom of expression; this right
shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of
frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of ‘my'
choice'. UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 19 of which Australia is a
signatory.
