### Submissions

1. I believe in free speech.

2. I think social media should have confirmed name and address to any postings, and/or an email address backed
up by a confirmed name and address that a judge can determine it be revealed.

3. I do not believe any person or written or voiced or video-ed be "cancelled".

### Regards,

#### Bob King
