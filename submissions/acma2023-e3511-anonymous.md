Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian. This proposed “misinformation” law is an attack on our
basic human rights by a government that is supposed to uphold those rights, not stifle them.

The government is attempting to place upon itself an impossible burden of objectivity. No government body has the
wisdom or ability to sort out what is true and what isn’t. Let me ask you a question who is the government to decide
for the people? The government does not have the freedom to decide for the people. A government that wants to
control people through this proposed legislation can only be viewed as authoritarian in nature. We have seen this
throughout history and is apparent today in the form of communism. What group of bureaucrats could possibly discern
truth from falsehood on every subject?

The bill’s stated aim is to keep Australians from “harm”. Preventing harm is a good thing. The problem is that the
proposed law will ultimately do great harm itself. One example is the recent pandemic and the question of where
COVID-19 originated. The official line was that it came from nature and that the lab origin was “misinformation” that
could “harm” our relationship with China.

Now we have learned that the virus likely did come from the Wuhan lab. What was once called “misinformation” is
now quite possibly the truth! The question of COVID-19’s origin is vital so that we can avoid a repeat scenario.
Censoring truthful reporting about the lab leak theory will itself cause “harm” by preventing us from learning from our
mistakes.

With this one example, we can see how the proposed “misinformation” law will increase “harm” even as it seeks to
reduce it.

The bill is an attack on freedom of speech and must be rejected.
