To whom it may concern

Exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023.

As a nearly 60yr old proud Australian with at least 3 generations of family born in this country I am deeply disturbed

and unsettled with the poor and unsupportive leadership (though some induvial stand out as being for ‘We the People’)
every Government has shown for more years than I can recall. What authority does any democratic Government have

to remove the basic rights of its sovereign people to own land without government control, grow food for consumption,
contain & consume clean uncontaminated water, use natural medicines & practitioners, visit whom they like when they

like, choose what medications they are exposed to and speak freely in private or public about any topic they deem

worthy including in the written word. As an unelected body, you do not have the right to censorship or to determine
what is misinformation and disinformation and I will never condone, accept nor comply with such a ridiculously

Marxist/Communistic approach to Governing. It is my will, that this bill be rejected.

Regards
Marten
