Submission to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts

Subject: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

To whom it may concern,

I write this submission with immense anger and outrage regarding the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe that this bill has been formulated without
considering the ramifications it would impose on smaller community websites and the
fundamental liberties of individuals.

The bill predominantly focuses on regulating platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter,
but inadvertently encompasses countless community websites that are part of the "social
web" due to its broad definitions. This approach is discriminatory and fails to discern
between large-scale platforms and smaller websites operated by individuals or small
companies.

I firmly assert that the legal risks imposed by this bill would severely restrict my freedom and
liberty, infringing upon my right to freedom of speech and enterprise. The broad and ignorant
nature of the law is akin to a scenario where the Australian government sets a speed limit on
every road across the globe, without even informing people about the specified limit. Such a
concept is preposterous and contradictory to the principles of democracy and individual
autonomy.

Under this bill, any website owner around the world that incorporates social features such as
comment sections or forums would be potentially subject to exorbitant fines. Individual
website owners face fines of up to AU$500,000, while companies, including smaller websites
that rely on advertising income, could be hit with fines of AU$2,500,000. These penalties are
far disproportionate and create an unbearable burden on individuals and small businesses.

Furthermore, non-compliance with industry-created codes is deemed an offence under this
bill. However, it is unreasonable to expect website owners to comply with codes they may
not even be aware of. Will foreign website owners, who are oblivious to these industry
codes, face fines upon arriving at the border? The implications of such enforcement
measures would be not only unjust but also impractical.

To complicate matters further, the growing migration from platforms like Twitter to
alternatives such as Mastodon raises questions about the bill's reach. Mastodon, a
decentralized social media network, has approximately 7,500 servers run by a diverse range
of individuals and organizations. Are these server owners expected to adhere to Australian
industry codes even if they operate from overseas and leave their servers accessible to the
global internet community? Should they block Australian users from accessing their servers
to avoid legal risks associated with enforcing these industry codes?

It is crucial to recognize that the proposed bill undermines the principles of free expression
and imposes unreasonable restrictions on individuals and small-scale website owners who
may not possess the resources or awareness to comply with ever-changing industry codes. I
call upon the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications, and the Arts to withdraw this bill or undertake substantial revisions to
address these concerns adequately.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take into account the genuine
grievances and outrage expressed by individuals who value their freedom and liberty.

Yours sincerely,

Jolanta Jablonska
