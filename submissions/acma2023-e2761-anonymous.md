Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a
non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.
For example, many news organisations such as the ABC regularly release "news" that is found to be untrue or
misinformation. Are we going to shut down these sources of information as well as those deemed ideologically
inappropriate by the present consensus? If the views of Government/Society change does that mean suddenly all the
censorship will be directed to the previous consensus holders? It is an absolute can of worms and a crazy thought
bubble by some bureaucrat or party operative.

It must be rejected.
