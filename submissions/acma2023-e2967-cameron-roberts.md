### SUBMISSION

I have experience in law enforcement and the legal system for over 40 years. I
###### have charged hundreds of people for various offences and prior to retirement last month, I checked / authorised court briefs of evidence in the thousands for over
 25 years. I have extensive experience in reading & interpreting legislation of many sorts and basing my prosecution approval (or not) on this.

 This is the most disturbing piece of legislation (draft) I’ve ever seen, for the following reasons.

##### • The definition of “Harm” is ridiculously broad to effectively cover people

###### simply not agreeing with the government. Eg: a difference of opinion on environment matters and being at odds with what the government want is seen as a threat to the environment..... seriously?
 " The removal of the right to silence to avoid possible self incrimination is in

 my view a complete departure from a right that’s been enshrined in our legal system for over 100 years. Even a murderer, rapist or child molester has a right to silence. The removal of this right for simply having a different view point is excessive and a complete abuse of power.

##### • effectively making it illegal to have a different opinion (basically to the

###### government) is an abuse of power / authority


-----

###### the public, various politicians and experts in various fields being seriously at odds with the government on matters.
 * This legislation is to silence opposition * This legislation is to prevent the public and some elected officials have

 ability to contact, inform and share information not to the government’s liking
 * While people are (I would have thought) free to hold various views, this

 legislation will effectively (in my opinion by deliberate intent) prevent people from being in touch, meeting, organising

##### • This legislation (through fear) will cause the electronic media, social media

###### organisations etc to be the government’s judge, jury and executioner
 e The need to send government details of people perceived to have

 transgressed exposes those people to further repercussions outside the scope of this law

 It’s clear looking at as much factual information from multiple sources, that the government has a serious credibility problem on a series of matters and that the public (in seriously large numbers) are taking major exception to it. This draft legislation is an abuse of authority and designed to shut down (largely by proxy) those not agreeing.

 By the government holding a majority in parliament, I fully expect this legislation
 to go through in its current draft state and hold the view that public input / consultation is nothing more than a “box ticked”, by a government so intent on its introduction it’s well and truly shown it’s hand and the matter is more or less fait accompli.

Regards

Cameron Roberts
