Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

This proposed bill to combat “misinformation and disinformation” must be wholly rejected.

Public trust in our governments and media outlets is low.

This authoritarian approach will decrease trust in our governments.

One very concerning aspect of the bill is that content authorised by the government would be exempt. It is incredible
that a government would be willing to make a law and exempt itself from that law. This bill proposes one rule for the
government and a different rule for everyone else. Such contempt for the Australian people the government is
supposed to serve must be condemned.

We do not need or want our governments to be the "Ministry of Truth", this Bill is absolutely ridiculous.
Do not pass this Bill.
