#### About the VEC

The Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) is a Victorian statutory authority established by the
_Electoral_ _Act_ _2002_ (Vic) (Electoral Act). The VEC is responsible for:

             - maintaining a register of electors

             - conducting State elections, local government elections, statutory elections and polls, and
fee-for-service elections

             - conducting electoral boundary reviews

             - administering political funding and donation disclosure laws in relation to State elections

             - conducting electoral research

             - informing and engaging Victorians in the democratic process

             - regulating electoral material on non-broadcasting media platforms in Victoria.

#### Introduction

VEC welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback to the Department of Infrastructure,
Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (DITRDCA) in relation to the
exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Bill).

In January 2023, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian Government
would introduce new laws to provide the independent regulator, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat online
misinformation and disinformation. The Bill would give the ACMA reserve powers to act, if
industry efforts in regard to misinformation and disinformation are inadequate.

The VEC notes that DITRDCA is seeking views on the Bill and whether it strikes an
appropriate balance on a range of issues, including:

             - freedom of expression

             - the complexity of content exemptions

             - the scope of the private message exemption

             - the size of the penalties and any other issues.

While the Bill deals with misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services in
general, the VEC is interested in the operation of the proposed reforms in the electoral space,
as well as the content exemption in relation to authorised electoral content.

This submission outlines the current regulatory environment in Victoria and the potential
impacts of the Bill in the electoral space. The VEC provides 3 recommendations in relation to
the Bill for DITRDCA’s consideration.

#### Regulatory environment in Victoria

Victorian State elections are governed by the Electoral Act. While the Electoral Act
acknowledges the internet as a means of publication, most provisions within the Electoral Act
pre-date the widespread use of social media and online digital platforms.

Today, digital platform services are an integral aspect of how Victorians discuss, debate,
communicate and inform each other of electoral matters. According to the Australian Election
Study, voters are increasingly accessing their political and electoral information online rather
than through traditional media.1 Over the past 10 to 15 years, social media has overtaken
traditional news media as the primary source of information sharing and news consumption for
some age groups, but some research suggests that there has been a decrease in the use of
social media for news by young people very recently.2

The VEC notes the risk of the increase in misinformation and disinformation published to
social media and that the original intent of the Electoral Act does not contemplate operating
elections in an online environment. With the development of sophisticated misinformation and
disinformation, such as Al-generated disinformation, the VEC notes that there are significant
challenges in relation to regulating misinformation and disinformation that can undermine the
integrity of elections.3

###### Use of social media by the VEC

In addition to the VEC’s responsibilities for conducting State and local government elections in
Victoria, the Electoral Act also requires the VEC to promote public awareness of electoral
matters through education and information programs, conduct and promote research, and
provide advice and report on electoral matters.4

In the _Inquiry_ _into_ _the_ _Impact_ _of_ _Social_ _Media_ _on_ _Victorian_ _Elections_ _and_ _Victoria’s_ _Electoral_
_Administration_ in 2020, the Victorian Parliament’s Electoral Matters Committee’s (EMC’s )
analysis found that tweets and Facebook posts with image-based memes or other humorous
images received considerably higher levels of engagement than other types of content
produced by the VEC and encouraged the VEC to continue with this strategy to increase
engagement levels.5

To that end, the VEC notes that social media provides more accessible channels through
which it educates, engages and informs Victorians about their democracy, often at lower cost
than traditional media, and with fewer logistical barriers than face-to-face outreach activities.

The VEC is also responsible for the enforcement, investigation and prosecution of offences
against the Electoral Act. The emergence of social media has necessitated greater agility in
the application of a regulatory regime originally intended to monitor political campaign material
like billboards, corflutes and how-to-vote cards. While ‘publish’ in the Electoral Act includes
publication on the internet, the breadth and depth of social media has, in some form or
another, created a new frontier for political communication.

Similarly, Victoria’s political funding and donation disclosure requirements are among the most
recent additions to the Electoral Act. In this field too, the VEC employs social media to both
obtain and disseminate information in its role as a regulator. Social media provides greater
visibility of grassroots campaigning, which assists to identify aspiring political actors and alert
them to their potential donation disclosure and reporting obligations.

###### Regulation of electoral campaign material in Victora

The Electoral Act regulates electoral campaign material, including electoral handbills,
advertisements and signage. Section 83 of the Electoral Act makes it an offence, at any point
in time, to print, publish or distribute or cause, permit or authorise to be printed, published or
distributed, an electoral advertisement, handbill, pamphlet or notice unless it is appropriately
authorised. Section 3 of the Electoral Act outlines that the material subject to authorisation
requirements is any advertisement, handbill, pamphlet or notice that contains ‘electoral
matter’.

‘Authorising’ material means including a person’s name and address on electoral campaign
material. The name and address form an ‘authorisation statement’. This ensures that
members of the public are aware of the origins of electoral campaign material and allows the
audience to decide for themselves how much they value or trust the electoral campaign
material. In the case of electoral campaign material that is published or distributed online, the
material must contain an authorisation statement,6 or link to a website that contains an
authorisation statement.

Section 4 of the Electoral Act defines ‘electoral matter’ very broadly. It includes any matter that
is intended or likely to affect voting in an election, as well as matter that contains an express
or implicit reference to:

             - the election

             - a current or historical government, opposition or member of Parliament of any jurisdiction
within Australia

             - a political party or branch, division of a political party

             - a candidate in an election

             - any issue before the electors in connection with the election.

The VEC notes that the Electoral Act does not provide clear guidance on how the offence
under section 83 should be interpreted in the environment of modern electoral advertising
practices, including the use of social media and online materials that were non-existent or in
their infancy when the Electoral Act was introduced. The VEC observes that the regulation of

6 This can be done by, for example, an authorisation statement on a user's bio or a pinned post that
includes an authorisation statement.

**Victorian Electoral Commission**


-----

online electoral campaign material is a matter of confusion and concern among electoral
participants.

Further to the authorisation requirement, the Electoral Act also prohibits, from the issue of the
writ to 6pm on election day, to print, publish or distribute or cause, permit or authorise to be
printed, published or distributed misleading or deceptive matter.7 However, this prohibition
applies narrowly to matter that is likely to mislead or deceive an elector _in_ _relation_ _to_ _the_
_casting_ _of_ _the_ _vote_ or a misrepresentation of the ballot paper that is likely to induce an elector
to mark the vote otherwise than in accordance with the directions on the ballot paper.

Electoral matter may be authorised but still be misinformation or disinformation, as the act of
authorisation does not, in and of itself, qualify the material as necessarily true or factual.
Authorisation statements can also be applied to any type of content. For instance, an
individual might incorporate an authorisation statement into a piece of disinformation, lending
a perceived legitimacy to the content without incurring any consequences. At present, the
content of authorised material is not subject to review by the VEC or any other body unless it
is for the purpose of assessing its compliance with misleading or deceptive provisions,
typically only on a complaint being received which prompts the same.

###### Self-regulation of digital platform services

Digital platforms are largely controlled by a small number of foreign multinationals, including
Facebook, Google, Snapchat, Twitter and TikTok. Stricter content moderation on the larger
platforms has resulted in the proliferation of small alternative platforms such as Telegram,
Parler, Rumble and Gab. These platforms are generally free and easy to use, enable and
encourage a proliferation of commentary on political matters, collect a vast amount of data
about their users, and utilise that data to enable paid advertisers to target to highly specific
demographics. Another common feature is a general resistance to regulation, as has been
seen in Australia.

At present, digital platform services largely rely on self-regulation to address misinformation
and disinformation. These strategies include regular updates to their operations and Terms of
Service. The VEC also engages with digital platform services to combat misinformation and
disinformation during elections.

**Statement** **of** **Intent**

In recognition of the potential for disinformation to affect the integrity of elections, the VEC
worked with 5 major digital platform services to establish a Statement of Intent for its 2022
State election (Meta, Twitter, Microsoft, Google and TikTok). The Statement of Intent set out
how the VEC and platforms would work together during the election period to reduce the risk
of harm arising from disinformation and misinformation, and breaches of electoral law.

Furthermore, the VEC made arrangements with 3 additional platforms (Reddit, Tencent and
Snapchat) to organise escalation channels for content potentially in breach of electoral law.
This showed a general willingness on the part of the platforms to support and uphold electoral
integrity.

_7_ _Electoral_ _Act_ _2002_ (Vic) s 84.

**Victorian Electoral Commission**


-----

The effectiveness of the Statement of Intent and voluntary arrangements varies. During the
Victorian State election in November 2022, a number of common misinformation themes were
identified, including:

             - voters who are not vaccinated will not be able to vote

             - the VEC uses Scytl/Dominion voting software and it will result in ‘rigged’ elections

             - postal voting is not secure or safe

             - the election will be void if less than half the people vote

             - the election is not legitimate because the writs have not been signed.

‘Take down’ requests will not be actioned if the material does not contravene the platform’s
own ‘terms and conditions’, or if the material is misinformation but does not breach electoral
law. Of the 6 takedown requests that the VEC made to platforms during the 2022 State
election, the response time was generally within one business day. However, only 3 of those
requests were successful in having the content restricted, removed, or labelled as misleading.
Of these successful takedowns, 2 were actioned because of a breach of the Electoral Act. The
remaining request was initially refused by the platform because it did not breach the Electoral
Act or the platform’s Terms and Conditions. After strong representations from the VEC, the
platform agreed to attach a misleading information label to the content.

**Victorian Electoral Commission**

**Example** **-** **take** **down** **request** **for** **disinformation**

On 30 October 2022, the VEC was alerted to a Facebook post through its social media
monitoring process, which alleges that the World Economic Forum, a not-for-profit
foundation in Switzerland, is running the 2022 Victorian State election. The Facebook post
includes a screenshot on a tweet on 25 October 2022 published by a Twitter account
###### ‘EZFKA’.8 The original content from the Twitter account states that the VEC has
announced that it will partner with World Economic Forum to oversee and count votes in
the 2022 State Election.9

Although the original content was produced for the purposes of parody or satire, the VEC
was concerned that responses to the content and the subsequent Facebook post indicated
that some members of the public were led to believe that the content was factually correct,
and that the election process was compromised. The VEC was also concerned that the
content was being shared out of context, where the audience may not be aware of the
satirical nature of the original content.

The VEC reported the post to Twitter via its Partner Support Portal and requested it to take
down the post for the reason of breaching Twitter’s Civic Integrity Policy. Twitter initially
refused to take action after it assessed the content and found that it was not a breach of
Twitter’s policy. After strong representation from the VEC, Twitter included a misleading
information label, but the content remains available online.

To reduce the impact of the content, the VEC updated its misinformation register to clarify
that the VEC does not partner with other organisation to count votes for the State
election.10

#### Current challenges

The VEC notes that there are clear indications that the public wishes to see action taken in the
area of disinformation, particularly as it relates to elections.11 National polls indicate that
approximately 90% of Australians desire regulations on misleading advertising.12 Research on
electoral-related dis/misinformation conducted by the VEC in 2022 found that:

             - 99% of respondents agreed that it was important to have a trusted and official source of
information in a democracy

             - 89% agreed that disinformation and misinformation should not be accepted

             - 55% of respondents believe there should be penalties for the spread of either
misinformation or disinformation.13

Despite strong desire from the public, the current electoral regulatory framework does not
effectively regulate misinformation and disinformation that can cause serious harm to the
integrity of electoral processes. The VEC acknowledges that while digital platform services
have been working with electoral commissions to address the issue of misinformation and
disinformation, volunteer actions from platforms have proven to be largely ineffective other
than where the Electoral Act is breached.

At present, take down requests from electoral commissions may take significant time to be
processed and actioned by a platform. Compounded by short election timeframes, serious
harm to the integrity of elections can be caused by misinformation or disinformation by the
time the information is removed from circulation.

The VEC’s recent experience in the 2022 State election was that platforms only responded to
take down requests where there was a clear breach of electoral law. As the Electoral Act
defines misleading or deceptive matter narrowly, misinformation and disinformation may not
be expressly prohibited if it otherwise satisfies requirements of the Act, i.e. authorisation
requirements. This caused serious challenges for the VEC in combating misinformation and
disinformation during the 2022 State election. As demonstrated by the example on page 8,
where there is no clear breach of the Electoral Act or Terms and Conditions of the platform,
the VEC has limited avenue for escalation beyond publishing on the VEC’s misinformation
register to address misinformation or disinformation about the election process.

#### Feedback on the Bill

The Bill seeks to increase transparency and accountability of digital platform services to
respond to misinformation and disinformation by providing ACMA with additional powers.
However, an exemption proposed in the Bill provides that all electoral and referendum content
that is required to be authorised, as well as unauthorised electoral and referendum content
that is misinformation, will not be covered by the code and standard-making powers of
ACMA.14

While clause 2 of the Bill defines harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes as a
type of ‘harm’ that is intended to be covered by the Bill,15 the example provided by the Bill’s
Guidance Notes suggest that misinformation undermining the impartiality of an Australian
electoral management body ahead of an election or a referendum will be exempted from any
code or standard-making powers of the ACMA under the Bill if it is authorised.16 The VEC is
concerned that the exemption regarding electoral and referendum content may leave a
significant proportion of misinformation and disinformation that can cause serious harm to
integrity of electoral processes unregulated. This is because electoral content containing
misinformation or disinformation can be compliant with the Electoral Act.

-----

The VEC is concerned that the Bill treats unauthorised electoral or referendum content
differently based on whether the content is misinformation or disinformation and notes that
content is only captured by ACMA’s code and standard-making powers if it is disinformation.
The VEC observes that in an electoral context, misinformation and disinformation can pose
the same level of threat to the integrity of democratic processes as each other. The
distributor’s intention is frequently irrelevant when assessing harm, as once the information is
widely circulated, a large number of voters can be affected by the content regardless of the
distributor’s true intention.17

Additionally, the VEC has concerns regarding the potential time required for a regulator to
ascertain the intent of disinformation distributors, especially when such determination is
necessary to differentiate it from misinformation. This could potentially result in the regulator
being incapable of implementing effective measures within the constraints of brief election
timeframes. The substantial time that might be needed to establish the distributor's intent
before regulatory actions can be initiated has the potential to render any codes or standards
ineffective.

The VEC notes that while elections should be robust contests of ideas between electoral
participants, misinformation and disinformation that undermines the integrity of democratic
processes should be and can be curtailed without affecting policy debates.18 The VEC
recommends that misinformation and disinformation about election processes should be
captured by ACMA’s code and standard-making powers.

While the recommendation will expand the remit of ACMA to the regulation of certain electoral
and referendum content, the VEC also notes that ACMA already regulates electoral and
referendum content to a certain degree. The _Broadcasting_ _Services_ _Act_ _1992_ (Cth) imposes a
‘relevant period’ (also known as election or referendum blackout period) where election or
referendum advertisement cannot be broadcasted on TV or radio station.19 The blackout
period applies to parliamentary elections at the Commonwealth, State and Territory levels.

17 For example, during the 2022 State election the VEC uncovered online content stating that people
who aren't vaccinated would not be able to vote. Whether the content was misinformation or
disinformation did not materially affect the harm it posed to the integrity of the electoral process and
confidence of the public in the conduct of the election. Victorian Electoral Commission, ‘Sorting Fact
From Fiction', _Misinformation_ _Register_ (web page) < https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/voting/learn-to-
vote/sorting-fact-from-fiction#MisinfoRegister>.

18 For example, disinformation about election processes may include disinformation distributed by a
foreign power to convince electors that their personal information will be unlawfully disclosed by
electoral commissions if they cast a vote.

#### Recommendations

The VEC recommends that:

1. DITRDCA considers misinformation or disinformation about election processes as a
sub-set of electoral or referendum content that is not limited by clause 35 of the Bill.

2. The Bill enables ACMA to register enforceable codes of conduct and develop
standards on misinformation or disinformation about the election processes for all
social media platforms, regardless of whether the content is authorised or otherwise.

3. DITRDCA considers whether ACMA should be provided with further enforcement
powers, for example civil penalties, to effectively ensure compliance with industry
standards.
