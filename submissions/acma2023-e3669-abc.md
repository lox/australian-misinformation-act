**Design of the new framework The ABC is supportive of the following propositions in shaping an appropriate policy framework to deal with misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms: (a)**


Abroad range of digital platforms should be encouraged to:(i)


adhere to an effective code of practice addressing misinformation and disinformation; and


Digital platforms providers should adopt and continue to develop robust systems and measures to address misinformation and disinformation on their services.(b)


-----

provide greater publicly available reporting on the volume and nature of misinformation and disinformation on their services, including Australia-specific data and subject matter categories, to enable more useful comparisons and a greater understanding of the nature and prevalence of misinformation and disinformation.(c)


Definitions of misinformation, disinformation and excluded categories of content should be based on objective criteria and observable conduct, rather than any subjective intent of the disseminator (as in the proposed definition of “disinformation”) or creator of content(as in the excluded content category of “content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire”).Reliance on subjective criteria is likely to make it more difficult for digital platform providers to effectively operationalisethe policy intentof reducing the proliferation of disinformation and misinformationonline.(d)

**Scope of excluded services The ABC understands that its services, such as ABC iview and ABC listen, are not intended to fall within the scope of the Bill and the way this is intended to be achieved is via certain “media sharing services” being excluded from Parts 2 and 3 of proposednew Schedule 9 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA). The Guidance Note accompanying the Bill indicates that media sharing services intended to be excluded from the Bill include broadcast video-on-demand services and subscription video-on-demand services. If that is the policy intention, the ABC submits that the Bill requires further clarification in respect of the exclusion of media sharing services provided by the ABC and other similar media organisations that subscribe to editorial rules or standards of the kind proposed for the Bill’s definition of “professional news content”. The existence of an interactive feature on those services, such as the ability to “like” a piece of content, should not result in those services being included within the scope of the Bill. 3.**

**Scope of information-gathering powers The Bill proposes broad information-gathering powers for the ACMA, including the ability to seek information and documents not only from digital service providers but also from other persons. The information-gathering powers in the Bill should be subjectto similar limitations as those under Part 13 of the BSA, which apply in relation to the ACMA’s broadcasting, content and datacasting functions. Most notably, Part 13 of the BSA provides for the protection of journalists’ sources. Equivalent protections for journalists’ sources should also be provided in respect of the information-gathering powers in the Bill.**
