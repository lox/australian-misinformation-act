      "The Bill should seek to not only prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation but also seek to prevent the misuse, misinterpretation or misapplication of these terms to limit free and fair comment that is non-harmful.",
      "The absence of a clear definition and interpretive guidance with respect to these terms potentially facilitates highly subjective interpretation.",
      "The Bill should require that any code of conduct must include provisions that preclude the removal of content or de-platforming of a contributor unless the information posted is demonstrated to be misinformation or disinformation, and likely to cause serious harm."
