Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

As an educated Australian I believe I have the ability to discern what is truth and what is a lie. I also believe that I
should be able to express my views about religion, politics or any other matter, in a respectful and well thought
through way. We are not a communist country. We should not be told what to believe and have different points of
view censored, just because they differ from the view of the government in power, at any given time.
The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”. But the government will cause harm by
silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the rights of the individual, not suppressing
them. I strongly reject this proposed legislation.

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” should cause grave concerns
about this bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from
getting and spreading the virus. Those who questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media. Yet it soon
became obvious to everyone the government was wrong, and the “misinformation” was right! Nearly every Australian
was vaccinated for Covid-19, yet the virus kept spreading until almost every Australian caught it!

The rationale for censorship on this issue might have been well-intentioned. The government were attempting to keep
us safe, but time proved that they were the ones who were misinformed.

This one example shows why giving the government even more power is a recipe for disaster. The government is
supposed to represent the people, not set itself up as a dictatorship.

This bill must be thrown out.
