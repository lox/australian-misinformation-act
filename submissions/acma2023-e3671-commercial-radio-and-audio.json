      "The Draft Bill imposes an additional layer of regulation on media companies, which is deemed inappropriate.",
      "The Bill could interfere with media freedoms by allowing digital platform service providers to determine what constitutes misinformation or disinformation.",
      "Commercial radio services and content should be excluded from the Bill's scope as they are already subject to comprehensive regulatory regimes.",
      "The definitions in the Bill are too broad and could inadvertently include services and content that should not be regulated.",
      "The Bill gives too much power to digital platforms to act as gatekeepers of content, which could affect the availability of trusted content from commercial radio."
