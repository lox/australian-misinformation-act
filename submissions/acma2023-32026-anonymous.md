Feeback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I oppose any form of censorship in Australia so I don’t support this legislation.

This legislation does not include the "government and government agencies” or "preferred news
outlets" in providing misinformation/disinformation, both have occurred in the last few years which
has been detrimental towards all Australian's.

This legislation does not state what is classed as misinformation/disinformation and is to widely open
to interpretation.

Freedom of speech and expression could be censored as it doesn't fit with the government’s rhetoric
of the day and this should be protected for all Australians to question and have the right to have
their voices heard.
