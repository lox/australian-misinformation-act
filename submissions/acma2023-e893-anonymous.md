I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a violation of
Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

In two world wars brave Aussies laid down their lives to protect and guarantee the freedoms we have enjoyed in this great nation
of ours including free speech without fear of censure. Having done two years of National Service in the '69 intake I am aware of
the cost for freedom. Freedom of conscience and religious belief is also a hallmark of a democratic society.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. George Orwell's book "1984" is a prime
example of a state controlled society where freedom of speech and thought is banned and punished. It is all too easy to see how
none-elected bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

Please reject this bill.
