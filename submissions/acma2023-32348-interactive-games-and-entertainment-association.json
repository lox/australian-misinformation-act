    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The definition of 'private message' should be clarified to include messages addressed to limited groups.",
      "Messaging in small and temporary online environments such as video game worlds should be considered private messages or lower-risk content.",
      "Online video game services should be excluded from the definition of 'digital platform service'.",
      "The 'primary function' test should focus on online communication rather than interaction.",
      "The definition of 'content' is too broad and should be narrowed.",
      "VoIP should be explicitly excluded from the definition of 'content'.",
      "ACMA's powers should only be exercised if there is a reasonable belief of misinformation or disinformation.",
