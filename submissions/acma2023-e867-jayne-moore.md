 Dear Sir/Madam,

 Re: Combafing the Misinformafion and Disinformafion Bill

 I have recently been made aware of this proposed bill by the Albanese Government. Having invesfigated the aims and intenfions of this Bill I am wrifing to express my strong concern and opposifion to its contents.

 From reading about its intenfions it is clear to me this is a case of significant government overreach. Australians value their freedom of speech as it is a hallmark of a healthy democrafic society. This Bill seeks to put way too much power into the hands of unelected bureaucrats who will exert the power to determine what is ‘harm’. There is no clear definifion of exactly what this ‘harm’ actually is but they themselves will be the arbiters of this. Right. They alone will determine what truth is and themselves be outside the controls of the Bill itself! A very dangerous situafion I would propose but a very handy tool for the sanifising and silencing of voices in society which may hold to a different opinion. Disagreement is healthy in a free society and in no way equates to hate. Mature adults are quite capable of disagreement whilst remaining respecfful and safe.

 This Bill has no transparency or accountability and will be a weapon to be used to shut down legifimate free speech on the current issues of the day. This places Australia in violafion of the UN Declarafion of Human Rights and the Internafional Covenant on Civil and Polifical Rights. Imagine these great reformers of our fime being silenced by such legislafion – Marfin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.

 Unbelievably I read that government authorised content is to be excluded from this censorship regime, how hypocrifical and inconsistent is this. So the Government is now the sole arbiter of truth. This is not only a red flag but several claxon alarms going off in my head as one looks at censorship imposed

# under the Third Reich. Do as I say not as I do springs to mind – blatant double standards that are incredibly concerning.

 I can see that the few provisions made to acknowledge the compefing right to freedom of expression are tokenisfic at best and certainly do not meet the high standards required under internafional law for the interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.

 As a schoolgirl back in 1980 I studied George Orwell’s 1984 with its story of the draconian totalitarian state of Oceania which governed the populafion by it’s all controlling Party brainwashing its populafion into unthinking obedience to Big Brother. The Party limited free thought and required its people to hold unswervingly to Government doctrines. The Ministry of Truth was the enfity involved with news, media, entertainment and educafional books – a deliberate misnomer as in reality it served the opposite ends – it created its own ‘truth’ namely lies propagated to the masses. Well as a woman of 56 I would never have believed I would be wrifing to object to a Bill up for proposal in Australia in 2023 which contains the most sinister overtones of Orwell’s social science novel.

 I urge you to please stand against this threat to healthy freedom of speech and vote against this insidious Bill.

 Yours sincerely,

 Jayne Moore
