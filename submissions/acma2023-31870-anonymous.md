# Objection Letter to the Misinformation and
 Disinformation Bill

## I, the undersigned, express my serious concern and opposition to the Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill proposed by the Albanese Government.

 I am deeply concerned that the proposed new powers will threaten freedom of speech and democratic rights in Australia in the following ways.

 • The Bill grants the government the authority to define truth,
 allowing them to control and manipulate the flow of information.

 • Whilst imposing restrictions on online platforms, the Bill gives
 the government and mainstream media a free pass, creating a double standard and eroding the principles of fairness and equality.

 • The Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media
 Authority (ACMA) to determine what qualifies as “misinformation” or “disinformation”. This subjective definition leaves room for abuse of power, and suppresses public debate and diverse opinions and perspectives.

 • The Bill effectively enables tech companies to become tools of
 government censorship, stifling free speech and undermining the open exchange of ideas.

 • The Bill paves the way for ideological conformity, suppressing
 dissenting voices and hindering independent thought. This goes against the principles of a democratic society that thrives on diversity and freedom of expression.

## I urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental rights of every Australian citizen as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

 Anything less along will cause serious, detrimental, implications for free speech and democracy in Australia. I urge the Australian government to uphold the principles of transparency and accountability, one which fosters an environment where open debate and diverse opinions are welcome.

 Kind regards
