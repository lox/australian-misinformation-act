I do not agree with the Communication Legislation Amendment (Combating
MisInformation and DisInformation). I believe that everyone should be entitled to
their opinion and should be able to express it freely without fear of retribution.
There should be no government censorship of peoples' views in a democratic
country. In addition, if this bill was to pass, the proposed fines are ridiculously large
and will frighten people from commenting freely. This ensures that debate is ended
and that only one side of the story is ever allowed to be told. One group of people,
chosen by the Government (ACMA) cannot be the arbitrator of truth in a free and
democratic society. Debate should always be welcomed, as very often what is
believed to be MisInformation or DisInformation now, will change with time. This
bill is about censorship and that is never okay. Australia has always been described
as the lucky country, where people are able to live without fear regardless of their
opinions. This bill will change that, and freedom of expression will be lost. Please
stop this bill from progressing.
