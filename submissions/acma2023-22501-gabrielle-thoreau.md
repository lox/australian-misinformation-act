# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 

 Free speech is the cornerstone of our democracy. The wellbeing of each individual and Australian society, as a whole, depends on it. Every human being must be free to respectfully and peacefully discuss and debate ideas, whatever they may be, in the public domain, and without impediment. 

 The recent mass censorship of certain perspectives on many media platforms across the globe, together with the ever-repetitive mumbo-jumbo- narrative spewed out by ‘professional’ media’, has brought home a spine- chilling reality. Thought is being monopolised under the guise of safety. There are thousands of examples of censorship in recent times. More than 4000 Covid related posts were censored in Australia. Even our own elected members of parliament were censored on social media after a directive that came from the Department Home Affairs.

 It is common knowledge that global corporate interests now drive, and perhaps, even control government policy. So, with the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, the question on everyone’s lips is: 


# “Who decides what is misinformation and disinformation?” 


# The answer is clear:


# “Not the people”.


# So, how will this Bill preserve our democratic society? It will not! 


# The Bill proposes censorship over material where the ACMA deems ‘harm caused to society’. Yet, there could be no greater harm to a democratic society than the removal of free speech. This Bill, if passed into law would create serious harm to our society by removing the Australian peoples’ right to present and debate their ideas freely. Australia would lose its standing as a democratic society and instead join the likes of China, with its record of unbridled human rights abuse. We can’t allow this!

 At one point, Einstein, himself discounted quantum physics, now a widely accepted field of science. Infection control by means of hand washing was once considered nonsense, yet today is realised by clinicians as fundamental. There is a litany of examples of this kind of thing. Debate, and diversity of opinion are essential for a thriving, enlightened society.

# Yet, this Bill is particularly disturbing as it provides the ACMA with the authority to vary, the ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ standard. That means it can decide what is truth and what isn’t truth and then disrupt the communication if the content is politically inconvenient for the government of the time. So where does that leave diversity of political perspective and the Australian people? Threatened? Betrayed? Abandoned? 

 Rather the government ought to turn their attention to combating misinformation and disinformation within their own ranks of ministers, institutions and what has now become their propaganda arm, the professional media. Strangely, this Bill exempts them all from telling the truth. How is that rational or reasonable? It is not. 

 This Bill, like other similar bills in Europe and Canada, is set to divide our society into two distinct tiers. Government and its influencers having the imprimatur to say what they like, however illogical, irrational, unsubstantiated, psychotic or just plain evil, and those who are criminalised for disagreeing with the narrative. In recent times we witnessed a heavily pregnant woman being carted off by police for a social media post. 

 This type of strategy has been repeated again and again throughout history. Russia, Nazi Germany, China, Cuba just to name a few, and we ought to have no legislative instruments that support such violation of human rights! It has been said “those who don’t know history are condemned to repeat it.” Australia must not allow this preposterous Bill!

 Words fail me to describe how strongly I oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. Under the guise of ‘safety’, this Bill appears to be nothing more than a move to crush freedom of religion, ideology and political views that are out of step with the underpinning agenda of the centralised world government that is poised to remove individual freedom and replace it with collectivism. Indeed, a communist style, totalitarian society. Horrifying!

 Let us not be ignorant. Let us not have a Ministry of Truth that decides for us. Let us not have the Thought Police! Instead, let the people be free to discuss, scrutinise and form their own opinions and never forget to be respectful of each other. Then, let the best of these ideas be shared for the benefit all. That is democracy. It is precious and ought to be protected.

 This Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is an abomination. There is only one place for this Bill, and that is in the shredder!
