**Re:** **Submission** **Exposure** **Dra�** **Communica�ons** **Legisla�on** **Amendment** **(Comba�ng**

**Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023**

Dear Department Representa�ve,

I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communica�ons and the Arts’ consulta�on on the Exposure Dra� Communica�ons
Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023 (“Bill”).

I do not support the proposed Bill, as it will severely undermine Australia’s democracy and the
reasonable expecta�ons of the public that they have the right to debate and discuss contemporary
issues without being subject to draconian censorship. I fear for our future. Should this Bill be legislated,
it will change the course of our society towards a darker age where we no longer celebrate democracy
nor encourage rigorous public debate on issues. Our grandparents and great-grandparents gave their
lives to defend democracy in both the first and second world wars. This Bill will severely reduce our
democra�c freedom and the general public’s ability to engage in conversa�ons with others on social
media pla�orms fully.

The meaning of the terms “misinforma�on” and “disinforma�on” is en�rely subjec�ve. These terms
have been weaponised to suppress the views of anyone in society that is not aligned with the latest
Government daily talking points. The Bill inten�onally limits censorship to words wri�en by the general
public and exempts the Government, Government agencies and various “official” organisa�ons from
the same legisla�ve obliga�ons. That is, the Bill’s dra�ing has inten�onally allowed the Government,
and certain organisa�ons, to distribute “misinforma�on” and “disinforma�on”.

In a democracy, individuals will never agree with each other all the �me on all issues. It is this diversity
of thought that makes our society stronger and it should never be discouraged or penalised through
draconian censorship by subjec�ve suppression of speech. Words are not violence. Hearing or being
exposed to opposing views, whether objec�vely true or not, is not violence. There is also no evidence
that the expression of minority viewpoints is connected to increased physical violence. For example,
there was li�le to no physical violence throughout COVID lockdowns when compared to Black Live
Ma�ers protests, despite the Australian Communica�ons and Media Authority (“ACMA”) asser�ons

that the majority of Australians were exposed to “dangerous” misinforma�on throughout 2020 and
2021. ACMA provides no evidence that the expression by the general public on social media led to any
significant nega�ve consequence to the broader society.

It will be a very sad day if Australians are legally censored based on the whims of a very small number
of bureaucrats who exist within a microscopic group think bubble. In a democracy the Government
and Government beaucrats should never have absolute and subjec�ve control to determine what is,
and is not, allowable speech on social media pla�orms by the general public. We learned during COVID,
that what was labelled as “misinforma�on” or “disinforma�on” at one point in �me may be
subsequently confirmed as objec�ve fact at a later point in �me. Examples during COVID were 1) the
virus escaped from the Wuhan virology lab and 2) that implied asser�on that all people within society
were equally at risk from the virus when studies clearly showed that risk was weighted towards the
elderly and/or those with mul�ple co-morbidi�es. We s�ll do not know the long-term health risks (if
any) that mandatory COVID vaccina�ons, and we will not know un�l sufficient data has been collected
and analysed over a long period of �me.

I am personally compelled to lodge this submission because I believe that when I leave this world it
should be a be�er place for those genera�ons that come a�er me. If legislated, this Bill will destroy
Australian society by severely undermining democra�c rights. I can not in good faith stay quiet while
watching the Australian way of life rapidly deteriorate towards a darker age.

Sincerely,

Resident

Electorate of Greenway
