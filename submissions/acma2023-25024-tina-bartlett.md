Until the events of the last few years, I considered that Australia was truly the lucky country. We lived in
a democratic society where you were free to express your views, not everyone would agree but it
opened up the conversation where you were able discuss differing views. This it turn meant that you got
to hear all sides, sometimes this meant you would change your views, it also meant that maybe the
other side would come to the same conclusion/view that you held.

As a democratic society we treasured the fact that we could have these differing views and still live in
relative harmony. As a society we felt sorry for the people that lived under authoritarian governments,
unable to have a choice or speak out against the ruling party. If this Bill is passed, the people of this
nation will wake up wandering whether they have been transported to North Korea or China, we will no
longer be able air our views on a public platform at risk of being fined or imprisoned. Those that will be
making the decisions as to what is to be termed misinformation or disinformation will reflect the
government narrative and as the last 3 years have shown us, they donâ€™t always get it right.

Allow Australia to continue to be a democratic nation, where freedom of speech can be heard, I implore
you not to pass this bill
