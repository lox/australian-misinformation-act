Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Elizabeth Hart

Submission:

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 threatens free speech and must be dropped.

It should be called what it is - the Censorship and Protection of Propaganda Bill, as its real
purpose appears to be to protect the Australian, State, Territory and Local Governments;
the mainstream media; and the 'education' system, from scrutiny and accountability.

Drop the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, this Bill is not in the best interests of the Australian people.

Where is the forum for the people to participate in discussion on policy?

Why isn't the taxpayer-funded ABC providing this forum...for the people?

The people must be free to speak, and discuss, and argue for the best outcome.

Much damage has already been done by the 'voluntary' industry code which has hindered
and censored free discussion on controversial topics.
