Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

The “Misinformation Bill” must be rejected.

Freedom of speech is essential for a free and fair society. It is a fundamental value of a free society and the proposed
bill will erode this human right.

Freedom of speech is essential in our attempts to discover truth and relies on free-flowing information that can be
tested and questioned by the individual.

There are many instances when society or the government of the day has held to a position or view on the truth, only
to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this essential dialogue

The internet has become a communication hub where the latest ideas can be debated and whilst there’s are positives
and negatives to modern technology, setting up government or higher bodies as the arbiter of truth is not the answer.

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.
