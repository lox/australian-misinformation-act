MISINFORMATION/ DISINFORMATION BILL.

To Whom it may concern,

I am writing today to voice my deepest concern regarding the above Bill. From what I
have experienced in the last 2 decades and especially in the last 3 years I see this
bill is going to going to be used more to further pave the way for the total
suppression of true information rather than to halt the spread of disinformation and
misinformation.

It is going to pave the way for unopposed governmental disinformation and
misinformation. By that I mean that Australian governments will be able to freely and
unopposed put forth their propaganda by disallowing an opposing online voice. It is
really that simple. They will be able to label opposing voices to be spreading
misinformation and disinformation and so be able to silence them.

How do I know this is what will happen? Simply because history repeats itself and
we have been badly deceived in the recent past by our governments. For example,
in 2003 when all the western governments read from exactly the same sheet
supplied to them regarding the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein
was supposed to have, yet didn’t. Most of the news media of the day had exactly the
same message, yet at that time anyone who wanted to oppose that message was
free to do so. Even so the overwhelming weight of public opinion went with the
governments and the mainstream media. The resulting war killed hundreds of
thousands of innocent Iraqis and devastated the land at the hands of our troops. This
disinformation, misinformation, in other words lies, was spread by the presidents and
prime ministers of the west including Australia as they all read from the same script
literally. Mostly we believed them and applauded the intervention, although some
discerning souls opposed it. Now, knowing the truth that no such weapons existed
and that it was a fabrication, I am appalled. I am appalled that I wasn’t informed
truthfully and that I was deceived into believing the lies of our governments. If I were
to have had access to the channels today that I see, I would have been informed
otherwise and would have had the possibility of not being deceived.

Bringing it up to today, the massive misinformation/disinformation that the
governments of the West and Australia spread to us, and are still spreading,
regarding covid and the vaccination is another example of lies sent out in the guise
of established truth. Every day now, more and more studies are showing that we
were lied to about almost everything - the origins of covid, the efficacy of the
vaccination, the amount and severity of the adverse reactions, the gain of function
research, the lethality of covid, the efficacy of masks, the efficacy of lockdowns the
numbers of covid deaths, the legality of lockdowns and on and on it goes. Most of
this new and true information would be disallowed under the above Bill and we would
have to continue believing lies in the darkness.

The misinformation/disinformation Bill, if passed, will be the perfect tool for a
malevolent government to turn against its citizens. It is just what and

his elites need to control the world population in the not too distant future. It is indeed
the “Ministry of Truth” in Orwell’s novel 1984 and the role of the Controller in Aldous
Huxley’s “Brave New World.” No government should ever be allowed to give itself

the role of sole arbiter of what is true and what is false. History screams this out at
us. We can see from China how that works out and from all the previous Communist
regimes of the 20th century.

The proponents of this Bill use the language of protection of the people. This is
merely a guise to clamp down on free speech and the free circulation of ideas. The
proponents of world government and totalitarianism are afraid of the truth and how it
will hinder their plans so they are scheming as to how to stop the truth from reaching
the masses. This was the tool of the Nazis, the Maoists, the Stalinists and all
totalitarian systems. The architects of this Bill are either short-sighted, naïve or none
other than aspiring totalitarians and it is they who need to be stopped.

The body set up to govern this disinformation/misinformation, could potentially be,
and most likely will be hijacked by ambitious ideologues who decide according to
their ideology what is allowed and what is not. This is as certain to happen as
evening follows morning. ACMA will become none other than a wing of the
government propaganda machine, be that regional, national or global government. It
will be charged with keeping out information which threatens the policies of the
government rather than seeking for truth. Truth only emerges in free discourse, and
for that to happen the risk must be run of allowing falsehood to be expressed.

I sincerely trust that this Bill never sees the light of day since we have been deceived
already so much by our governments of both sides and since there is much
deception emanating from government, they must never be given such a power as
this because they will certainly misuse it and no one should know that better than a
politician, especially one who knows a little history.

Yours sincerely.
