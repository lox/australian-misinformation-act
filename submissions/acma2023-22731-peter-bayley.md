**Comments on Comba+ng Misinforma1on and Disinforma1on Bill 2023**

It is a worthwhile objecLve for government to keep the internet free of material encouraging
child pornography, terrorist recruitment, sadism, brutality, violence, insurrecLon and
forceful overthrow of the government and democraLc insLtuLons.

I believe the proposed Bill goes too far and will constrain freedom of expressions. In
parLcular I am concerned about:

1. The definiLon of ‘harm’ is extremely broad, interpretaLve and subjecLve. ‘Harm’ should
be limited to vicious, extreme, shocking, and deeply egregious harm.

As an example, I can foresee that encouragement via a social media post to undertake
bushfire risk control burns could be deemed as ‘harm to the environment’. There are
many other examples I could give however, it’s easy to see that acLvists will use this law
to limit the scope of free expression.

2. If this Bill is to proceed, governments ought not be exempt. A standard should apply to
all, if the standard is to be respected.

3. Big tech companies already filter content to suit their own poliLcal views. There are
many examples of this in Australia and overseas. This Bill, and the Codes of PracLce that
may arise from it, will give digital plaXorm service providers ‘cover’ to undertake more
backroom censorship and content filtering.

4. A civil penalty based on company global turnover is not appropriate. The seriousness of
a parLcular breach ought to be the determinate of a penalty, not the economic size of
the company.

I do not support the Bill in its current form as it will sLfle free speech. The Bill needs to be
recast and be only limited to prevenLon of vicious, extreme, shocking and deeply appalling
harm and misinformaLon.

Yours faithfully

Peter Bayley
