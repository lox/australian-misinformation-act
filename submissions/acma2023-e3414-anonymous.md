Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am writing to express my opposition to the Misinformation Bill, which must be rejected.

Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a free and fair society and forms the foundation of democracy. It is a
fundamental value of Australia. Despite denials to the contrary, the proposed bill will erode this fundamental human
right.

Freedom of speech is essential in attempting to discover truth. The whole process of discovery relies on free-flowing
information that can be tested and questioned. There are many instances when society or the government of the day
has held to a position or scientific idea, only to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this
essential dialogue.

The internet has become the ‘town square’ where the latest ideas can be debated. Now people can send factual
information around the world in an instant, as well as spread false ideas. There are positives and negatives to modern
technology. But setting up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer.

As a young adult, I fear for my rights and my future in this country. A country which, if this bill is allowed to pass, will
cause Australians with legitimate opinions and concerns to self-censor out of fear of being accused of conveying
misinformation by a single self-appointed source. This completely undermines free speech and expression.

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.
