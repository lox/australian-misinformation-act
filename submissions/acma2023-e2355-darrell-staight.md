Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

**Message**
With the greatest of respect I would like to make a submission strongly against the proposed misinformation and
disinformation bill that is being proposed. It is nothing short of censorship and a really concerning proposition. I
don't even think many Australians are aware of this and what it could mean for the future but have no doubt it will
be a very fast slippery slope to a dystopian future which is unrecognisable to most of us. Exactly who decides what is
misinformation and disinformation? If you take social media for example then most of the stuff that is being
censored by so called 'fact checkers' is actually demonstrably true.

In particular much of what has been censored over the last few years, for example alleged medical misinformation
raising genuine concerns over experimental vaccines that were rushed out and alternative treatment that was
re-purposed, effective and yet was incorrectly called 'dangerous'     - this is very concerning. Remember, many many
genuinely credible and credentialed experts were raising the same concerns. Are we to understand now that
misinformation and disinformation will be applied to anyone (no matter their expertise) if they challenge dogma and
orthodoxy being pushed and financed by Big Pharma? The very same companies that have previously incured billions
of dollars in penalties in the past for concerning practices?

Please do not allow this bill to pass. It will take our country to a very dark place. Now, more than ever (considering all
the mistakes that were made during the last few years) is the time for healthy and open debate on all subjects. For
your consideration.
