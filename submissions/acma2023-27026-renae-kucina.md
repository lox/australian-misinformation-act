**Submission**

"I may disagree with you, but I defend to the death your right to say it." - Voltaire.

We cannot allow censorship of peoples opinions. The right to speak freely, without restraint, is
essential to democratic government because it enables us to develop better laws and policies
through challenge, rebuttal, and debate. Many in society communicate through online media
platforms, where thoughts and opinions can and should continue to be freely discussed. This is a
good thing. Trying to censor people by calling it misinformation or disinformation is meaningless, as
we've already seen take place with 'fact checkers' branding posts on social media as such when it has
later been shown to be truth.

Censoring freedom of expression in Australia puts us firmly inline with China and North Korea where
freedom of speech is significantly limited.

Censorship is a form of media monopoly, where the government oversees all media content in order
to maintain obedience.

Australia has long held the reputation of being 'the lucky country'. Envied by other nations. Where
we have the right to act, speak and think freely - as long as it doesn't prevent others from doing the
same. With a good government that is efficient, transparent, responsive and accountable to citizens.

Why now does the Australian government wish to censor and suppress the Australian people?
Governments only do this when they are a dictatorship with hidden agendas they wish to suppress.

Australia is a country that prides itself for its freedom of election and being elected. The freedom of
assembly and political participation. Freedom of speech, expression and religious belief. Removing
any one of these rights is a slap in the face of every Aussie and the beginning of a move away from
democracy!

This censorship cannot be permitted to pass.

Sincerely,

Renae
