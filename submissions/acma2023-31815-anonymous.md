Reject the Misinforma1on/Disinforma1on Bill – Governments should not put themselves in
the role of “Arbiter of Truth”.

The proposed Communica1ons Legisla1on Amendment (CombaFng Misinforma1on and
Disinforma1on) Bill 2023 is a disgraceful control measure that has no place in a democracy.
It threatens free speech which should be a non-nego1able human right.

The bill indicates that “misinforma1on” encompasses statements that lead to ‘harm’,
including psychological harm. If this bill is passed, Australians will find themselves on a
slippery slope moving towards a situa1on where anyone is able to claim a form of harm if
they are offended by someone’s “hatred”. This is very subjec1ve, and someone simply
expressing an opinion that is contrary to another could be seen as harmful. What one
person considers to be truth, and worthy of expression, or even helpful is deemed harmful
by another. The concept of “hatred” is poorly defined in the bill and for this reason is likely
to lead to the erosion of freedom of speech. We are seeing the results of similar efforts to
contain “hate speech” in the UK through “hate speech laws” where anyone who protests
about something or expresses a religious viewpoint contrary to the state risks being
subjected to police ac1on.

Australia has developed an increasingly large silent majority who have ceased to have a
voice for fear of being subjected to being shamed for holding opinions that align with their
tradi1onal values. We have seen our government implement levels of censorship through
major media outlets and regulatory bodies to suppress alterna1ve viewpoints regarding
medical treatment during the pandemic. Newer research and data in our own government
databases supports a different opinion on the safety of the vaccine in contrast to that which
was originally disseminated by the government. However, this informa1on was deemed an
“inconvenient truth” to the government when it became available and regular news outlets
fell into line in censoring it. This bill is akin to allowing the fox to guard the henhouse.

Other targets for censorship under “harm” include climate science and gender poli1cs. Our
major news providers tell us that the science is se\led and that there is no room for debate
on such issues: However, science is science because it is never se\led and there is always
more research and other viewpoints and models to consider. For example, in respect to the
gender iden1ty debate, consider the facts coming out of the in the
UK which was forced to close due to the shocking outcomes of early transi1oned children.
Parents are now taking legal ac1on against the for medical mismanagement of
minors. This is emerging research. It is not se\led science, and Australians need access to all
the informa1on to make informed decisions. Many examples can also be cited regarding
conflic1ng views and evidence in the areas of environmental and climate science. ShuFng
down debate and dissen1ng voices is an Orwellian approach to government and Australian
ci1zens should be alarmed by this bill.

This bill provides government with powers to compel a wide variety of placorms including
search engines, social media, web forums, and instant messaging to self-censor the
informa1on available to the Australian public under threat of significant financial and
criminal penal1es. These informa1onal access points cover most ways in which Australians
access “informal” informa1on sources. While professional news content, content authorised


-----

by the Australian, State, Territory or Local Governments and content produced by accredited
educa1on providers is excluded from the misinforma1on/disinforma1on scope, it is notable
that any contrary opinion or dissen1ng comment is not. In effect, this bill endorses the
provision of a one-sided, government-controlled “informa1on” dissemina1on system.

The Fact Sheet pertaining to this bill states that the ACMA will have no role in determining
truthfulness, nor in taking down or reques1ng ac1on regarding individual pieces of content.
However, the affected placorms will be forced to adopt systems and measures to ensure
informa1on is censored accordingly or risk the consequences of non-compliance. The
penal1es are substan1al, making it likely that the “voluntary code” will tend towards
maximum compliance with governmental standards of “truth”. The voluntary aspect of the
proposed codes is a sleight of hand.

A key point of the Fact Sheet is that “misinforma1on and disinforma1on pose a threat to the
safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy”. This
paternalis1c aFtude being taken by the Australian government, effec1vely treats its ci1zens
as children, and not adults who can make their own decisions about their health and other
ac1vi1es. We are a diverse na1on with a wide variety of faiths, cultural norms, and poli1cal
persuasions. We also have a proud history of tolerance for each other’s ways and views. If
anything, this bill presents the most egregious threat I have ever seen to our way of life,
respect for difference and our democracy. We should not be giving away our right to access
and interpret informa1on for ourselves, regardless of whether the government views it as
fact or fic1on. As Australians we have always had the right to access informa1on from all
sources and to come to an informed understanding of issues without governmental or thirdparty interference designed to bias and shape our viewpoints. Misinforma1on is not the risk
Australians face: instead it is an unnecessary, Communist style informa1on regula1on
system that is the far more significant threat to our na1on.
