# To whom it may concern.

 The last three years have been the most frightening and stressful time of my life. I am a Registered nurse of forty-three years…extremely passionate about evidence based medical and nursing care and have strongly advocated for my patients if I see a lack of care or medical mistreatment. I have been commended for standing up for my patients when a misdiagnosis has been made….and it happens more frequently than the public could imagine!

 Then came COVID…. watching the China videos of people dropping dead in the street was terrifying but my medical knowledge made me doubt their authenticity and the fact that there was never a medical debate about how a virus could kill so quickly in an obviously symptom free person was concerning!

 From then on, this deadly scenario became the basis for what appeared to be a respiratory flu like virus that was affecting the elderly and people with multiple co morbidities, not unlike the seasonal flu.

 The China videos caused the politicians to go into over drive…. lock downs, masks, lack of community medical treatment (GP clinics closing) patients told to stay at home until they could no longer breath…. which left no time once in hospital to treat, only to resuscitate i.e., ventilation (even oxygen and nebulizes were banned due to risk to the health care workers) … naturally without treatment… steroids, high flow oxygen. nebulizers etc the patient died! this was called a COVID death!... 

 Some Intensive care doctors were speaking out and some nurses but they were censored. Still lack of debate with the treating doctors on the ground, the only narrative came from the WHO and government Chief medical officers who have not been involved with direct patient care for many years. The directive to cancel as misinformation all advise from doctors at the coal face treating patients before they needed hospital care with well-known cheaply available drugs and supplements with success…they were silenced!

 The only hope according to, the WHO and  was a warp
 speed experimental vaccine using an mRNA technology that had previously killed the lab rats and was deemed too dangerous to be tested on people unless they were at end of life. 

 All medical professionals were contacted by AHPRA and told that we were obligated to support the Government narrative for the vaccine or lose our

# licence and even face six months in jail. I was sacked for not taking the vaccine as were thousands of healthcare workers around Australia.

 Today we now know the vaccine is useless, it does not prevent infection or transmission and the vaccinated are developing increased risk of hospitalisation with COVID, cardiac and neurological issues. We know that Zinc Vitamin C and Vitamin D and Ivermectin can help fight the virus…. many of us knew this information right at the beginning but as it did fit the narrative we were cancelled as spreading misinformation! yet an experimental vaccine was not allowed to be debated with medical experts including the inventor of the mRNA technology! How many lives could have been saved if they were all allowed to debate?

 A worldwide community of cancelled doctors and medical experts has joined together… sharing their knowledge online to help treat COVID, long COVID and vaccine injured and preparing for future Pandemics. But even knowing that they made serious mistakes with the treatment of COVID the WHO and politicians are continuing to ignore their advice…planning for the next pandemic and the next vaccine! and part of the Pandemic plan to silence the dissidents and prevent their so-called disinformation and misinformation from reaching the public forum.

 The science is never settled! and the best science results from vigorous debate from multiple independent specialist…the internet allows for their arguments to be broadcast to the public who would otherwise only have the Government and MSM to educate themselves. And as the Government is exempt from the disinformation and misinformation laws this information is unreliable!

 In a Democratic country the people have a right to free speech and to decide for themselves what information they wish to follow!

 Kind Regards
