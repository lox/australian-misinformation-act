**RE:** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment** **(Combatting** **Misinformation**

**And** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023** **(the** **Bill)**

Associate members,

I would like to offer my take on the above Bill, in line with your request for feedback to get a 'feel' for
how it sits with other legislation going through a similar review process. Well, I would like to suggest
that unless your bureaucratic Department has a connection with some sort of judicial oversight, I can
not understand how you have the ability mete out seriously punitive infringement judgements, that

include actual jail time penalties, severe fines and even to the point issuing of summonses. While
provisions in this legislation suggesting that individuals can be coerced into matters of self­
incriminating themselves has me totally bewildered. In any court of law in any democratic country,

one of the most fundamental policies that is fully adhered to is the individual's right to a fair trial and
to be tried in an open court by a jury of his peers. This behaviour is not acceptable under any
circumstance and is strictly prohibited under our Judicial System and the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Australia. If you are not familiar with the term "Jurisprudence", then I suggest you

step off your High-horse and indulge yourself with a little reading to study what a Federal Authority

can and can't do.

As a simple suggestion to any possible challenges to the High Court over these dangerous and
insidious clauses where again there are other issues that deny basic human rights to an individual

caught up this Neo-Nazi entanglement of such draconian provisions. You see, provisions, clauses and
other such language do not have the power nor the authority you seem to think they have to deny
people natural justice to which they are rightfully entitled. First thing that needs to be done is to
eliminate ALL sections of the Legislation that relates to these punitive actions completely. With no
preamble to indicate the reason behind the heavy-handed approach to follow this dark and

dangerous path into the possibility of total censorship under a future corrupt and Neo-Marxist
government. Everything that's virtually needed to suppress democracy is present in this legislation.
Only a few things need to change and it's ready to go. Just a bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

Funny about that, I don't believe in coincidences. At least, not in nature, anyway. Yeah, right.

If I am correct with my assertions, it raises the serious questions as to the credibility and competence
of all Associate Members, including both the Chairperson and the Deputy Chair. I am curious to know


-----

your work history and the understanding of the functions of the positions you hold. I am also, to

believe that the ACMA is supposedly a completely independent authority and yet the Chairperson is
afforded a fairly close (business) relationship with the government Minister for Communications, etc,
of the day. I wouldn't call that a totally independent scenario, surely not.

As to other issues relating to further amendments to the Bill, I find the definitions of such words as
'Harm', 'Misinformation', and 'Disinformation' are so broad, it will force all digital platform providers
to modify their algorithms to encompass basic words that would cover every possible situation and
scenario imaginable and those that no one in their right mind could possibly envisage. And, even
though you are attempting to censor free speech by Proxy, you don't think the High Court won't see
through your ploy. You people must be from another planet. Surely, whoever you think is gullible to
believe that your only intension is to protect the sweet ears of the Woke and weak, sad and lonely
people of Australia from the horrors of Reality. Is the truth it really that bad and horrible that you

must save our virtue from the facts that our Federal Governments, whether or not they are Labor or

Liberal, it doesn't seem to matter any more are hell bent on doing their own thing and, no longer
prepared to do what necessary and right?

The governments of today are only too pleased to follow the Leaders of other countries with the

likes of Covid-19 vaccines, the Lockdowns, and the Mandates (which are not recognised under the
Constitution), and the failure to follow the United Nations' Charter of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. And yet, these governments and our Main

Stream Media are the very entities that have been pushing the false narrative day in and day out are
the very ones that the ACMA is now proposing to be exempt from prosecution. Well done on your

behalf, it is absolutely incredulous that you are virtually planning to protect the ones who have been
doing nothing but lie, bare-faced to the media and to the public continuously ever since being voted

in, again on lies and the propaganda of their election campaigning. So much for your complete and
honest 'Independence'.

I think I lost my way somewhat, I wanted to highlight a lie you have concocted regarding the need to

have such legislation here in Australia. I fail to understand how and why such a Big Brother approach

is necessary, as I have pointed out earlier. And, the reason you used to promote this insidious agenda

is that mis/disinformation is spreading across the world, unchecked. Well, no surprises there.

Obviously, in all other Western democratic countries, they are all going through the same issues that

we are facing. Again, no surprises there. But, as for bringing down a duly elected government
through malice and general mayhem created by the general populus through social media is pure
rant and not based on truth, but from someone who is more prone to pro-Marxist sympathy rather
than genuine concern for the Brotherhood of Humanity. The fear of the unknown is a good excuse to
run away from your real responsibilities and seek solace in the arms extremists, radicals and

progressives. Unfortunately, your true support is too easy to see and far too difficult to hide. In the
long run, maybe it would be better to scrap the whole evil legislation altogether and start with a
better approach to your real job and life, in general.

It is unfortunate that I have gone down this path to point out that some people tend to lose focus on
the real issues in life. There is no genuine reason why some people fail to maintain their focus when
they feel their ideas of grandeur overtake their life and the actual beliefs they hold dearly. Now, I feel

I will not be taken seriously with my criticism seeing I've unintendedly fired personal jibes at you and
other Associate members. You see, a long time ago I was part of a Contracts and Tender Analysis
Group in what was once called the Postmaster General's Department which is now, of course, called

Telstra. So, I understand the internal structures of government department, probably better than
you. I also see things that many others easily overlook. I certainly understand human nature better
than most, but, besides all that bragging, the failure to provide an avenue for appeal is definitely one
of the worst failings of any organisation that I can imagine.

I cannot understand how you are so delighted to establish such a massive bureaucracy to monitor
what we know about these Digital Platform Providers is that we are already being subjected to
extreme censorship as I type this letter, right now. So, what is going to change under your brutal but
pointless new laws, hmm? All you'll have is a building full of Public Servants and being paid by us
poor bloody Taxpayers. For what? No work, no output? Twitter and Facebook are not stupid, they're

in this game to make money. You and your useless rules won't stop them from achieving those goals.

I could discuss further other big issues I have come across, but, unfortunately, time will defeat me if
continue to prattle on as I feel I am. I hate repeating myself and I'm typing as fast as I can, without re­
reading. Big mistake. That's it. I'm sure you won't find anything interesting in here, especially if you

are empire building. Don't forget whose paying your salaries!

Regards,

John Hodson
