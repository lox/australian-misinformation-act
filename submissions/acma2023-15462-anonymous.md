# OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED 

 “Misinformation” Law

This law and the pursuit of the draft Bill to establish the “Misinformation Law” must be abandoned
in the name of democracy and the Australian way. There is absolutely no position that can be
argued that shows the proposed law to be anything more than a "Blunt Instrument" for any
prevailing Government to SENSOR, SUPRESS and SUBDUE any conflicting positions, findings,
research, science, dissenting argument or point of view that contradicts questions or challenges a
position, policy or mandate held by the incumbent power. The proposed Law and associated Bill
could, and probabilistically, will be used by Governments, Executives and the Judiciary against
citizens and organizations with differing political views to an incumbent Government or a prevailing
"vibe". There is also the strong possibility that this Status Quo of the Law if passed, will extend to
the Corporate and Industrial Sectors which will further suppress, constrain and stifle free thought,
expression and speech in Australia. This situation is not democracy; it is defined as communism and
totalitarianism. If this Bill is passed, the only place that all sides of an argument, topic, policy,
concept or idea could be heard will be under Parliamentary Privilege's. This is obviously not lost on
the proponents of the Bill to pass this “Disinformation Law”.

Additionally, there is no government or related body that could ever be relied upon or
comprehensively trusted to fully determine the accuracy, validity or scientific basis of any position
that is misaligned to the policy or mandates of an incumbent holder of a position or power. As such,
Misinformation will be determined in the eye of the holder of power, comprehensively subjective
and at the mercy of the inherent bias and foundation of the Misinformation Arbiter. The evaluation
of the "Quality of Information" is fundamentally subjective and the very high potential for the
checkers of information to be misinformed, biased or directly manipulated is unacceptably high,
especially in complex matters. Any Law, such as proposed, is the very foundation of communism
and totalitarianism and is a proven demonstrable cornerstone of communist policy. China, Russia
and North Korea use this technique to control its citizens, deprive them of access to information and
even rank citizens in a social point system by how deeply they embrace the doctrine of the
incumbent power.

The idea and ultimate position of what “Information” is, and what “Misinformation” is, will by logical
conclusion fall to some designated body or Government Department. How can such an entity be
impartial and unbiased without a basis of legal proof of fact that would stand up in a law court?
What are the extents of the applicability and powers of this proposed Law? What are the Citizens
recourse based on fair process and access to free representation? How will this body be funded?
How will allowable ‘Information” be communicated to the public? Unfortunately for the proponents
of this Bill, there are mounting examples globally of the information recently termed,
“Misinformation”, “Conspiracy Theory” etc now being exposed as being based in a lot more facts
than we were coached and encouraged to believe. Will citizens found guilty of “Misinformation”
have the same tax payer assisted legal recourse to restore their character and achieve compensation
when “Misinformation” is found to be verified as “Information Based in Fact” in future times, highly
doubtful the Australian Citizen will be protected in such a scenario. Misinformation in the context of
the proposed law is a modern construct. In a true democracy, there is no inherent threat related to
freedom of information, free speech and the ability of the citizen to sort information into the correct

category of quality. There is however, a definite scenario clearly visible with the proposed Law that
will deprive the Citizen of the suite of all information. This will clearly limit the citizens ability to
make balanced decision based on all points of view and data in the Australian and global open
forum. It is demonstrable, that currently, "Misinformation" really means "inconvenient / opposing
views” or any dissenting view based in logic, scientific process or structured rational argument and in
many cases facts that differs from the prevailing view of the incumbent power.

I hope that the democratic ideal is still the basis of the Australian context of Government, and our
Government will not sink into communist ideals reflected in the proposed Bill to pass the
“Misinformation Law”.

In summary, it is abhorrent to think that a democratic Australian Government would even consider
passing powers to the Judiciary to impose financial and imprisonment penalties onto its citizens for
vocalising or publishing dissenting views to the incumbent power. Australia is a democracy, the
citizens can, and do, discern disinformation from credible information, Australian citizens are
capable of evaluating issues and arriving at conclusions without the benefit of Government
censorship, intervention or interference. Australia does not need this repressive communistic
“Disinformation Law”, we are, and hopefully will continue, to be cemented in a Constitutional
Democracy.
