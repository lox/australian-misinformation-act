## Exposure Draft: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting


## Misinformation and Disinformation Bill) 2023


## New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation


## The proposed Draft Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation is flawed because the whole underpinning ideology is hostile to the principle of free speech. Therefore, none of the provisions are worthy of serious, analytical legal consideration. This draft should be resisted and immediately cancelled.

 The Draft, would enable the federal ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority), wide Orwellian dictatorial powers to control and dictate the content of political and other opinions on social media, by labelling them as putatively misleading, deceptive or causing harm to the Australian people, economy, environment and democratic process. 

 This entire proposed Bill joins a long line of anti-democratic legislation (social, political and economic), since the 1970s which have used a socialist technique of gradualism to undermine Australia’s system of governance and common law freedoms.

 Thus, the ACMA would end up being a sole arbiter of self-defined “truth” and alleged infringements by Internet providers and ordinary community users of online social media platforms. 

 This draft clearly illustrates an ideological hypocrisy – ‘the intolerance of intolerance’. It crudely boasts of protecting ‘democratic processes’ yet this legislation would in effect, castrate (online) freedoms of speech.

## True ‘democracy’ is the duty of government to conform to the wishes of the people, in a context of system of checks and balances on the abuse of power. Today, this true meaning has been turned upside down, to mean any government can decide what is good for the people, just on the basis of being elected – a “mandate”.  

 The Federal Government does not realise its hubris. NO human authority is absolute: all human authorities are only legitimate authorities if they function the way God (of The Bible) designed them to, according to His prescribed Divine standards, which to our benefit have been the basis of Western civilisation success. 

 If sham governments and sham bureaucracies enact legislation which is hostile to the Word of God (The Bible), then those governments and their bureaucracies, have no real, true legitimacy.

 Such deformed versions of authority, WILL always proceed to later stages of citizen discrimination and on to eventual citizen persecution, overbearing intrusion into private lives through counterfeit and sham laws, rules and (politically correct) codes of practice. The new mantra is now, ‘Thou WILT conform’.

 This Draft is another step towards a new style of global tyranny- a joint venture between The State and Corporations. 

 Unless Australia goes back to its Christian standards and the processes which guaranteed the success of Western civilisation, this new restrictive tyranny will ensue.

 Former Professor of Law at Macquarie University, the late Dr. Mark Cooray was very prophetic in his remark:

 “Australia is not yet a totalitarian society”
