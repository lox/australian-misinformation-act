I vehemently object to, and oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The proposed bill severely undermines freedom of speech by attempting to 'balance' that fundamental
right (to free speech) with the notion of combating so-called 'misinformation'. Fundamental rights
cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are undermined.

Determining what qualifies as purported 'misinformation' is subjective, and entrusting a government

agency to determine truthfulness raises serious concerns. It is unreasonable to propose that a
government agency or officers be designated as 'fact checkers' or 'judges of truth'.

The whole purpose of online platforms, forums, articles, blogs, gatherings, and other channels of
communication is to encourage open speech, ideas exchange, debate and information exchange. To
propose that content, be it written or spoken, be subject to the judgement of a few selected people
from government and privately (government) funded organisations is ludicrous, and without merit.

Purported 'misinformation', unless it incites violence, does not cause direct harm, and defining harm
based on subjective criteria is problematic to say the very least.

This proposed bill grants excessive control to authorities and will most certainly lead to censorship and
silencing the voices of the people of this country. It is unreasonable to censor the ideas and opinions
of people in a democratic country. The very notion of this in un-Australian and will cause harm to
millions of people and erode the rights our forebears fought and died for.

Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of speech. Making the
proposed amendments into law will destroy the people's inalienable right to free speech and must not
be accepted into law.
