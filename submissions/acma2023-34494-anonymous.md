**The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation)**

**Bill 2023.**

This is my Submission opposing The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Freedom of speech is paramount to a democracy. This Bill would create a top-down Ministry of
Truth and deny Australian People a voice or access to alternative communication, information and
opinions.

It is not the Government’s job to “keep Australians safe” as described by Communications Minister
Michelle Rowland. The Australian People do not require, nor desire any Government or
Corporation(s) deciding which opinions we cannot hear, read, write or speak. Differing of opinion is
how we learn and improve ourselves. The ACMA should not be the arbiter of what is the truth. I
oppose any Laws/Bills or Acts that would allow the ACMA or any other body to restrict any form of
communication or speech of the Australian People.

We have experienced more than enough censorship of truth and valid medical and public opinion
and data over the last 3 years, with swathes of misinformation by our Professional News
Broadcasters, Politicians and Bureaucrats. So much so that many Australians have no faith left in
these institutions. Excluded content for misinformation purposes however includes governments of
all levels, professional news content and includes content created by foreign governments. This
sounds extremely Orwellian and not at all democratic. It seems the only diversity frowned upon now
is diversity of thought and opinion.

It is quite concerning that any Government should seek to silence speech in any form whether it be
by the people or a political opponent. There is no time in history where this has ended well. To
quote Benjamin Franklin “Without Freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom; and
no such thing as public liberty, without freedom of speech”.

I therefore vehemently oppose The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 as it is not in the interest of the Australian People.
