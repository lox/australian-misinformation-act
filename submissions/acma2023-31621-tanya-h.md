**The Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and**
**Disinforma�on) Bill 2023**

I am wri�ng to explain why I do not support The Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment
(Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.

This Bill would lead to the government defining what the truth is and give power to the
Australian Communica�ons and Media Authority and online pla�orms to enforce it.

This bill would result in the government being the ul�mate authority of truth, and anyone
who disagrees with that ‘truth’ would be censored and / or punished.

The rules would not apply to the government and mainstream media, even if they share or
promote informa�on that is not correct – which is o�en the case, especially the media.

It would also lead to digital companies self-censoring the valid views of Australians to avoid
the risk of huge fines.

The defini�ons of disinforma�on and misinforma�on are not clear and open to
interpreta�on.

It is not clear who determines what informa�on is false or misleading, and how independent
this process will be.

It would mean what informa�on I receive and how I receive it, is to be controlled
paternalis�cally.

In a democracy and a free country, people must be able to receive informa�on from a range
of sources and draw their own conclusions. People need to be supported to develop cri�cal
thinking skills about the informa�on that is available – they can consider the source of the
informa�on, if the source is credible, what other support or debate there is etc.

We need firm, robust debate and I do not support a Bill that will allow my informa�on
sources to be curated based on what the government wants me to know or not know.

As a health professional, I have seen this type of censorship firsthand – clinicians used their
professional judgement, research, and cri�cal thinking skills to support clients in an
individualised way, but if their management or advice didn’t align with the government
mantra at the �me, these clinicians were censored and/or expelled from their organisa�ons
– despite a wealth of informa�on to support their treatment plan.

And other very �mely examples include social media pla�orms censoring informa�on about
The Voice to Parliament and about the recent pandemic in terms of health outcomes and
data.

No Government should limit freedom of speech.
