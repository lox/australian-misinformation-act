Dear Secretary,

**Please** **see** **below** **regarding** **submission**

# The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating

 Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Cth)

I am requesting please that this draft Bill **not** to be implemented as it inhibits freedom of speech and free

human thought.

The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication- see below

UN Declaration of Human Rights-

_"Universal_ _Declaration_ _of_ _Human_ _Rights-Article_ _19-_ _Everyone_ _has_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _freedom_ _of_

_opinion_ _and_ _expression;_ _this_ _right_ _includesfreedom_ _to_ _hold_ _opinion_ _without_ _interference_ _and_ _to_ _seek,_

_receive_ _and_ _impart_ _information_ _and_ _ideas_ _through_ _any_ _media_ _and_ _regardless_ _offrontiers."_

              - It is not up to the government (or political party that is in power at the time) to decide

what the "truth" ., Truth can be an individuals opinion, or can be change due to scientific advancement in the
physical form. It must not be restrained by Government or organizations, but encouraged and liberated.

The next generation must not be restrained by the past in thought or in learning to challenge to current statis,

              - The Bill includes a vague an ideological definition of "harm" which risks it being

weaponized to shut down legitimate speech on pressing social issues.

Thank you for the opportunity and time for allowing commenting regarding this draft Bill.

Regards

# Anna Paroz
