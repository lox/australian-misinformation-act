PEOPLE who work for US what we can say or not say We live in a democracy n without FREE SPEECH this world would
still be classed flat The government got covid wrong The Voice wrong So absolutely no to any kind of authoritarian censorship
So NO NO NO We live in a free democratic country n it is going to remain that way The people of Australia hold that power
not bungling beaurocratic governments and uneducated people in positions they should not be in
Yours in freedom of speech
Robin and Gillian Rixon
