    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The legislation imposes restrictions on free speech through censorship.",
      "The definition of 'misinformation' and 'disinformation' is subjective and controlled by the government, which could lead to abuse.",
      "The government exempts itself from being labeled as a source of misinformation, which is seen as self-serving.",
      "The legislation could suppress dissenting views and opposition to government narratives.",
      "Historical examples, such as during the Covid period, show that government-labeled misinformation was sometimes later proven correct.",
      "The legislation contradicts Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which supports freedom of opinion and expression."

    "Main Themes": [
      "Free speech and censorship",
      "Government overreach and control",
      "Subjectivity and potential abuse of power",
      "Historical context and examples",
      "Human rights and international commitments"

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "This is potentially dangerous as it is open to broad interpretation, driven by self-interest.",
      "It allows government to be the sole judge of ‘the truth’ in the pursuit of its agendas. No opposition is to be discussed/tolerated. Orwellian, indeed!",
      "In many instances, it was subsequently revealed that the alternative views had been correct, so government itself was guilty of ‘misinformation’!",
      "The proposed legislation is clearly in breach of this noble principle which, to my knowledge, Australia is still committed to uphold."
