I submit that I am concerned as to whether given recent events in recent years where it is evidenced
that Government departments and politicians have failed to properly investigate matters they regard as
Misinformation, disinformation which leaves their decisions on these issues highly suspect.

There is too much going off half cocked to avoid proper scrutiny of political agendas and people
control.

Information regarding matters such as climate change, the covid vacines and moral issues that comes
from governments has shown a lack of preparedness to thoroughly examine all the available facts and
issues and provide same to the public. Which means the real facts are not available to the Australian
public.

As an example I have been informed that “The Prime Minister has confessed that he
# hadn't fully read the Uluru Statement before endorsing it.” (quoted from Damian Huxham National Secretary | Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party.)

Having spent time with aboriginal people in various places in this country, and having seen the real
results of the real aboriginal cultures (Plural not singular) and the cruelty of them and the poverty they
lead to, I regard the propaganda being pushed regarding this referendum as misinformation and a
failure to inform Australians of the real histories of the many aboriginal peoples and the tensions, and
wars and underlying simmering sinful violent attitudes that do so much harm and the vendettas that
follow from the outcomes. There are political issues involved and the obvious sanitising of the
attitudes of cultures to make them seem something different to what they are is false information.

There has not been proper discussion of the real issues relating to the multiplicity of aboriginal
peoples (plural not singular ) in this country. Nor are the real histories of the many tribes being made
known and properly examined.

On other issues it is clear from laws made and other political decisions in recent years that few
politicians know the difference between right and wrong and they are obviously hardly qualified to
make moral decisions.

Because the real issues are not properly examined openly in proper public debate with all available
information on the table, those who harm others are essentially being protected, the rule of law is not
followed and Australian people are having to suffer unnecessary hurt and hardship by governments.

I would suggest that because of the way governments have worked to prevent freedom of speech in
this country, issues are not out in the open where they should be.

There need to be properly organised and informed open and public debates on the many issues
relating to things like, climate change, Covid vaccines etc. Issues that governments or their appointed
officials may regard as misinformation or disinformation, which can only be perceived as such when
important information is ignored for the sake of political agendas. There are so many facts being
ignored and called misinformation or disinformation in order to manipulate political agendas.

As things stand there is too much likelihood of governments and government agencies making
arbitrary decisions for the benefit of party agendas, to the harm of the Australian people.

The failure of adequate notification of bills before parliament gives the average busy Australian little
time to properly examine and reply to issues like this.
