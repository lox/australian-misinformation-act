# Subject: Feedback on the Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am wrifing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the Communicafions Legislafion
Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023. As an Australian cifizen, I
believe that this bill demonstrates a complete disregard for the freedom of speech and the rights of
ordinary cifizens. With the increased use of “nudge teams” and propaganda via the media it is clear
these proposed amendments to the current legislafion heavily impacts our democracy in a totally
unbalanced manner.

Firstly, the bill creates a clear divide between two classes of cifizens. One class consists of polificians,
journalists, and members of educafional insfitufions who have the power to spread informafion,
whether it is true or not. The second class includes regular cifizens who often possess a wealth of
knowledge and insight on various topics, including industry insiders. This bill unfairly favours the
former group while suppressing the voices of ordinary people who rely on the internet to express
their opinions and engage in democrafic discussions. It’s intent is to ensure that only one narrafive is
heard, all other views will be suppressed.

Moreover, the excessive fines imposed by this bill will lead to a chilling effect on freedom of speech.
Digital services will become more restricfive and caufious in their approach to speech, surpassing the
already stringent regulafions. Addifionally, the code's applicafion across the enfire industry without
any "pressure escape valves" will further amplify the harm caused by this bill. The internet, hailed as
the most powerful democrafic invenfion, will thus be dangerously hindered.

The bill's aftempt to judge what is true or untrue is an impossible task and therefore based on a
dishonest premise. Knowledge is constantly evolving, and new informafion often contradicts what
was once widely accepted. The inclusion of public health-related informafion in this legislafion is
parficularly concerning. Many statements about COVID-19, inifially perceived as factual, were later
proven false. These examples highlight the challenges in accurately determining what consfitutes
misinformafion or disinformafion. Such a broad scope for removal of both provably false and even
true but misleading informafion raises serious concerns about censorship and the restricfion of free
speech.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, raised significant
concerns about the scope and applicafion of this bill. His scathing rebuke on Twifter indicates that
experts themselves have reservafions about the bill's implementafion.

Furthermore, the bill's reliance on industry bodies, which are often influenced by large players in the
industry, will potenfially create anfi-compefifive pracfices. The regulafions formulated by these
bodies may serve as gatekeeping mechanisms for smaller digital services, hindering their ability to
compete effecfively. The recent market compefifion between plafforms in addressing misinformafion
and disinformafion has shown promising results, with users migrafing to plafforms that meet their
expectafions. This organic process should not be undermined by imposing onerous regulafions that
benefit the largest digital services.

Addifionally, the extraterritorial applicafion of this bill on foreign enfifies and the lack of knowledge
and compliance with Australian law pose significant challenges. Other countries may follow suit and
impose similar requirements on Australian digital services operafing globally, leading to a fractured
and restricted global internet. Australia should not undermine its posifion as a democrafic nafion by
imposing its laws on foreign websites and plafforms.

Furthermore, the proposed bill's interference with personal faith and belief systems is deeply
concerning. Categorizing certain religious perspecfives or fundamental faith worldviews as
misinformafion demonstrates a lack of tolerance and respect for diverse opinions and beliefs, as
enshrined in the Universal Declarafion of Human Rights.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communicafions Legislafion Amendment (Combafting
Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023. It threatens the freedom of speech and sfifles the
powerful democrafic potenfial of the internet. The bill's reliance on industry bodies, its
extraterritorial reach, and its interference with personal faith all contribute to its misguided
approach. I urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communicafions and the Arts to reconsider this bill and protect the fundamental rights of Australian
cifizens.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I trust that you will carefully review the concerns raised by
myself and many others who share similar viewpoints.

Sincerely,

Sean Moran
