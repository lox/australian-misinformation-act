It is not the Government’s role to decide what constitutes misinformation or disinformation, and

hence what constitutes acceptable speech and information. Australian Government’s, both Federal

and State, have displayed shear incompetence and wilful neglect for adherence to the Australian

Constitution, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Australia lends its

freedom of opinion and freedom of expression (Australian Government Attorney-General's

Department, 2023).

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill

2023 [herein: The Bill], seeks to leverage digital platform providers to regulate information on the

internet deemed ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’. Below is a selection of recent events, backed

up by Government data and other information sources, highlighting how poorly Australia’s

Government’s have behaved without the support of this bill.

Since the epidemic of personal freedom abuse of Australia’s population throughout and after the

COVID-19 pandemic, governments have proven unsuited to:

i. Governments cannot interpret facts and information, and apply risk frameworks designed to

act in the best interest of the public. See:

a. Mortality rates of COVID-19 in 2021 (n=1122) (Australian Government Australian

Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023) versus influenza deaths in 2017 (n=1183)

(Australian government Departmetn of Health, 2023).

b. The Covid-19 vaccine does not stop transmission (al, 2021)

ii. Display conscience and remorse for misjudgements and decision which negatively impact

the people of Australia. See:

a. Woman arrested in her home for organising an anti-lockdown rally (BBC News

Australia, 2023). An excellent example of authoritarian/totalitarian censorship and

punishment of citizens for actions misaligned with Government advice.

iii. Exercising measured and effective policy as new information becomes available. See:

a. Ineffective and unnecessary Wellcamp airport quarantine facility (Hope, 2023) and

the associated cost.

The above evidence suggests governments cannot be trusted to act in the interest of the people. The

Bill seeks to expend on the poor, constitutionally misaligned, behaviour expressed since 2020 in

response to the Covid-19 virus. The Bill will write into law what has been permitted ad-hoc. This

expansion of powers is intolerable. As summarised by Harry Truman 73 years ago:

“Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only

one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a

source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear." (Truman,

1950)

― **Harry S. Truman**

I am a perpetual proponent for people to speak their opinions, and engage in civilised discussion

such that battle of ideas to generate eh best possible outcome for the population. I do not support

tightening of Government control over the population and restriction of ideas. The Communications

Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is fundamentally

undemocratic and I do not support it.
