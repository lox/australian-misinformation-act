**Misinformation and disinformation Legislation Submission**

I am totally opposed to this proposed legislation. I believe both the Federal and State
governments want to play big brother and completely censor us and shut down Freedom of
Speech

According to this legislation we, the people will be banned and/or fined heavily for speaking out
and spreading what they ‘deem is untrue’, yet they are not subject to the same rules. This is a
major concern for me! For this reason alone I believe free speech should not be legislated. I
believe there should be appropriate codes of practice in place for people to follow and
appropriate consequences after being warned but we do not need Government dictating what we
can and can’t say and dishing out excessive punishment. It would be no different to living in a
dictatorship if this legislation were to be passed and made into Law.
