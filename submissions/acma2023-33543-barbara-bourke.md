l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
The proposed bill undermines freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that
fundamental right with the notion of combating so-called ‘misinformation’.
Fundamental rights cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are
undermined.
The recent Covid-19 pandemic has shed light on this matter as much of the
information presented by the public health authorities was later proven false.
Determining what qualifies as so-called misinformation/disinformation is subjective
and entrusting a government agency to decide truthfulness raises concerns.
So-called ‘misinformation’, unless it incites violence, does not cause direct harm, and
defining harm based on subjective criteria is problematic.
The bill grants excessive control to authorities and will lead to censorship.
Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of
speech.
