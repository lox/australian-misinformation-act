# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation


I am writing my strong opposition to the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This Bill states that, “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.” Who is deciding
what misinformation and disinformation is? Who is deciding what is fact and what is not? The
biggest threat to democracy is the censorship this Bill will enable.

I have seen MANY examples of so-called misinformation being censored to then turn out to
be fact.

This Bill is very undemocratic! The ‘powers’ would NOT increase transparency. It would be the
opposite.

Why is the government so worried? Does it think so little of its citizens? In a democratic
society, information should always be discussed and debated, not censored. Censorship
promotes distrust amongst citizens. Distrust of government is increasing and this Bill will only
make it increase more.
