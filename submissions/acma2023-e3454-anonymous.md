Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

My name is and I would like you to consider the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.
## m

It seems to me that the proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to give and receive information via electronic
media. This should really be an Australians’ human right and this bill must not be allowed to proceed.

It is easy to see how unelected bureaucrats may be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are
granted to them.

Please reject this bill.
