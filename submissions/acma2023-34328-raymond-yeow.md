CANBERRA ACT 2600

Dear Director General,

This submission has been made on behalf of the Australians for Science and Freedom.

The organisation is an Australian association which has the purpose of promoting proper
scientific inquiry and was founded by a number of academics and public intellectuals,
initially as a response to policy adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ASF has concerns about the proposed amendments to the act and believes it would be
against the interests of scientific advancement and democracy for it to be passed.

Our submission follows.

Yours faithfully,

**Rebekah** **Barnett** **Graham** **Young**

**1.** **Onus** **on** **proponents** **to** **show** **the** **need** **for** **the** **legislation.**

**a.** **Not** **established** **on** **the** **research** **commissioned** **by** **ACMA**

In seeking to limit freedom of speech the onus should be on ACMA to sufficiently
###### demonstrate that there is a problem. They have failed to do this. In the first place, as discussed in section 1.B., the initial research on which the legislation is based is flawed. It doesn’t demonstrate any increase in misinformation and disinformation (however they are defined)1, nor does it demonstrate that significant harms flow from any misinformation and disinformation currently available on digital platforms.

 Further there is a need to show that alternative and currently existing legislation is not adequate to police false and misleading information and any harms stemming from it.

 We currently have trade practices, competition law, and other legislation which should be used to police the material disseminated by companies on digital platforms. For example a real danger could be said to exist from false advertising of products, but this is a trade practices matter. Or someone might be ramping a share price, but this can be handled by the securities code.

If that policing is not being done effectively at the moment, the question should be
###### raised as to why that problem wouldn’t be best tackled by resourcing the existing agencies designed to tackle it, rather than implementing entirely new legislation and giving resources to an organisation not designed to police it.

To the extent that the material covers matters of personal reputation or harm, then
###### the defamation, human rights and anti-discrimination laws would appear to give individuals and corporations the ability to enforce their rights including having material removed.

 This is self-regulating and removes the matter to the legal system, which is where appropriate judgments about harm and damage can most appropriately be made, along with preservation of legal rights, including that of due process.

**b.** **No** **further** **research** **is** **relied** **upon,** **but** **there** **is** **nothing** **which** **we**
###### are aware of which justifies this legislation.

In a report2 to the Australian Government justifying the need for its proposed
###### expanded powers, ACMA does not sufficiently demonstrate the scale and volume of misinformation and disinformation nor the nature of the harm with which it can be associated.

 ACMA states that, “the true scale and volume of misinformation in Australia in

1 Australians for Science and Freedom does not accept the definitions of misinformation and disinformation
put forward by ACMA, which is inconsistent with the dictionary definitions of these terms, as addressed in
Section l.C. Accordingly, any further mention of misinformation or disinformation are as 'however defined' and
should not be taken to indicate that we accept the definitions put forward by ACMA.

###### currently unknown.” The report references “increasing concern” about a perceived increase in “misinformation” online, measured by survey respondents reporting how much misinformation they believe they have seen. However, this conflates reports of misinformation with actual misleading or factually inaccurate information, failing to demonstrate that the concern is founded.3

 Conflating subjective user reports with actual instances of misleading material and online harm is common in government and peak body reporting in this field. Other potential factors that may give rise to an increase in reports of misinformation and online hate, such as increased social sensitivity, better promotion of reporting tools, and the impacts of cultural developments (e.g.: political polarisation) are rarely explored.

It bears noting that government officials frequently stress that reports of perceived
###### physical harms on pharmacovigilance databases associated with, say, Covid vaccines, should not be misconstrued as instances of actual harm. Alternative explanations for reports of perceived harm are typically proffered, with the onus of proof being put onto those who wish to demonstrate a causal link between reports of harm, and actual harm.

 By the same token, it is incumbent on ACMA to demonstrate that perceptions of an increase in misinformation online, and perceptions of resultant harm, correspond with an actual increase in misinformation and harm.

 Furthermore, research underpinning ACMAs findings is based on an error of categorisation. Content that contradicts the official position on a range of issues is categorised as misinformation, regardless of its veracity or contestability. This will be discussed further in section 1 .C.

To demonstrate the harmful impact of online misinformation and disinformation,
###### ACMA references the US riot on 6 Jan 2021. However, its quantification of the harm caused by this event includes misinformation - ACMA attributes the unrelated deaths of several people who died of natural causes to the riot - raising questions about ACMAs ability to reliably discern true information from misinformation.4

 ACMA refers to research showing that anti-vaccine content, even if true and accurate, can sway people’s vaccination intentions, but does not demonstrate how this causes harm, and to what extent.

 A case study on the real-world impacts of anti-5G content makes a more convincing demonstration of fiscal harm resulting from information classified by researchers and ACMA as misinformation.

 However, it is unclear as to how the proposed measures in this bill will prevent such harm - there appears to be an inherent presumption that online censorship of certain information will reduce real world harm, but research shows that censorship simply

###### encourages users to find work-arounds, a fact acknowledged by ACMA in the report.5

 Moreover, as the ACMA bill does not include content produced by the government in its definitions of misinformation and disinformation, it will not address the arguably far more considerable harms perpetrated by misleading information disseminated by the government. For example, case studies quantifying the impacts Australian Government’s Covid response, including the propagation of misinformation such as
‘the vaccines will prevent transmission’ and ‘lockdowns save lives’ have
###### demonstrated astronomical fiscal, life-year and social harm, yet under this bill, such harm would not be mitigated.6

**c.** **Circular** **definition** **of** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation**

###### The bill relies on a circular definition of misinformation and disinformation, whereby the official position is the ‘true’ one, and contradictory information is ‘misinformation or disinformation.’

 This circular definition is arrived at in two ways:

1. First, the study by the News & Media Research Centre (University of Canberra)7
###### that was commissioned by ACMA to inform the development of the bill categorises beliefs that are contradictory with official government advice as ‘misinformation’, regardless of the veracity of the advice. For example, in Table
14 showing the coding of‘Misinformed Groups’, respondents are coded as
###### misinformed if they:

 a) Agree that wearing a mask does not significantly reduce your risk of infection or spreading the virus; b) Disagree that the Covid-19 vaccines that are approved by the health authorities are safe; or,

 c) Agree that in most cases, Covid-19 can be prevented or treated by taking vitamins and supplements or other over the counter medicines.

 As all three of these positions are supported by peer-reviewed scientific literature,
it is incorrect to categorise these respondents as misinformed. A better
###### description would be to categorise these respondents as believing information that contradicts the official position.

It is noteworthy that the second publicly-funded study commissioned by
###### ACMA, a social media content and network analysis by creative consultancy We Are Social, remains inaccessible to the public on the justification that it “contains sensitive information pertaining to public figures and user accounts.”8 This underscores the existing asymmetry of the information environment, wherein public resources are used to produce and conceal information, while at the same time, ACMA seeks more power to demand transparency from and control over digital platforms and their users.

 However, the few snippets of the We Are Social report shared by ACMA indicate that the researchers make the same error as the N&MRC study, by mislabelling scientifically-supported concerns as ‘conspiracy’ and ‘misinformation.’9 For example, ACMA details four “misinformation narratives” examined in the We Are Social study, including ‘anti-lockdown conversation’ and ‘anti-vax conversation’ (by which we presume that We Are Social has forgone the traditional meaning of ‘anti-vax’ - anti-all vaccines - for the new meaning in common parlance, i.e., ‘sceptical of the safety and/or efficacy of Covid vaccines’, which is itself disinformation).

 The fact that at least two of the four identified “misinformation narratives” are supported by a body of scientific literature and observational reports, such as cost-benefit analyses, again highlights the faulty logic on which the research informing the misinformation and disinformation bill is based.

###### ACMA states that, “Belief in COVID-19 falsehoods or unproven claims appears to be related to high exposure to online misinformation and a lack of trust in news outlets or authoritative sources.” This should be rephrased, “Belief in positions alternative to the official position appears to be related to high exposure to alternative viewpoints and a lack of trust in news outlets or authoritative sources.”10 We suggest that serious introspection by the latter on why this is so would be the better remedy.

 Thus, it is clear that the conceptual foundation for ACMA’s definition of misinformation and disinformation is ‘information which contradicts the official position.’

 2. Second, the bill explicitly excludes content produced by government, accredited educational institutions, and professional news from the definition of misinformation and disinformation. This is a departure from the traditional definitions for misinformation and disinformation, which encompass all information that is false or misleading, either unknowingly (misinformation) or

###### with the intention to deceive (disinformation), and do not exclude information/content based purely on its source.

 Why misinformation and disinformation disseminated by government, accredited institutions and professional news outlets should be excused from laws purportedly intended to minimise the digital proliferation of such content is not justified within the bill. Nor is a rationale offered for the bill’s departure from the traditional definitions of misinformation and disinformation.

 The specification that misinformation and disinformation are content that could imply a broad range of harms further compounds the problem. Harm by what measure? If a government says its policies save lives or perform some other social good, and content produced by the government is immune from misinformation and disinformation regulation, it is highly likely that ‘harm’ in the context of this bill will be determined to be any outcome that runs counter to that intended under the policies of the government of the day.

 2. Legality

**a.** **Breaches** **implied** **freedom** **of** **political** **expression**

###### The High Court has found an implied freedom of political expression which is based on the idea that for a democracy to function there must be a free exchange of ideas.

 While the bill attempts to sidestep this freedom it is highly likely that there will be challenges, and that these challenges will be successful. Classifying government information as free from an imputation of misinformation or disinformation would seem to guarantee that, as it would potentially disadvantage the communications of those who wish to challenge the government, but challenge of government is of the very essence of democracy.

**b.** **Breaches** **natural** **rights** **and** **due** **process**

###### The bill sets up a situation where what is, or is not, misinformation or disinformation is determined by codes of conduct applied by either industry organisations, or social media platforms. These may be quite arbitrary and given the potential punishments for publication of opinions the ACMA regards as untrue, are likely to be conservatively framed and favour official narratives, no matter how unlikely these narratives may be.

 The amount of data that social media platforms are required to police means that “infringements” will be determined in the first place, and in most cases and probably ultimately, by Al. The lack of human judgment means that natural rights and due process will not be given to most of those who produce material deemed to contravene the legislation.

It should be noted that the Robodebt scheme was deemed illegal because it
###### alleged a debt on the basis of statistical likelihood. What is the difference between that, and how social media will need to police this law?


-----

**3.** **Anti-Democratic**

**a.** **Platforms** **will** **play** **safe**

###### ACMA says that it will not be the arbiter of what is true and what is misinformation or disinformation, outsourcing the adjudication of content to the platforms. However, platforms will be penalised if ACMA determines them to be in breach of industry standards and guidelines set by ACMA, by allowing misinformation and disinformation to be disseminated on their platforms. Therefore, platforms will be incentivised to ‘play it safe’.

In practice, this means that digital platforms will remove or restrict content that
###### counters official positions, or that falls into the ‘grey’ area between obviously true vs. obviously false. Platforms will take the official government position as de facto for ‘true information’, judging anything that contradicts the official position therefore as ‘misinformation.’ This is already happening.

 As example, YouTube’s medical misinformation policy defines misinformation as, “content that poses a serious risk of egregious harm by spreading medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities' (LHAs) or the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidance about specific health conditions and substances."11

 The real-world consequence of platforms taking official positions as de facto for ‘true information’ is the censoring of valid, and often true information. For example, YouTube cited this policy as grounds for the removal MP John Ruddick’s maiden speech to the New South Wales Parliament from its platform.12

In another example, platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
###### censored over 4,000 social media posts during the pandemic years at the behest of the Australian Government, many of which contained true (factually correct) information.13

**b.** **Avoid** **risk** **by** **outsourcing** **to** **“fact** **checkers”** **which** **is** **dangerous**

###### ACMA states that it will not determine the truthfulness of individual pieces of content, but that digital platforms will be encouraged to use a range of tools including Fact Checkers.

Fact Checkers are engaged by digital platforms as independent arbiters of
truth. However, they are not independent, and they have no greater claim to
truth than anyone else.

-----

In court proceedings, Facebook has claimed First Amendment protections for
its Fact-Checker decisions, a tacit admission that fact-checks are just
###### opinions.14

Unfortunately, these opinions are frequently wrong on matters of fact.
Additionally, Fact Checkers routinely misrepresent contestable topics as
‘settled science’ and conflate the absence of evidence (due to undone
science) with categorical evidence of absence.

For example, AAP falsely claimed that the Australian Government had not
tried to hide reports of Covid vaccine adverse reactions.15 Documents
released under FOI request revealed that the Therapeutic Goods
###### Administration (TGA) did in fact hide child deaths reported following
vaccination, due to concerns that disclosure, “could undermine public
confidence.”16 In another document release, the Department of Health was
shown to have actively sought for the removal of Facebook posts describing
users’ adverse reactions to Covid vaccines.17

The RMIT Fact-Lab unit falsely debunked claims that Covid vaccines were
affecting women’s menstruation, only for the claims to be proven true when
evidence was published in the peer reviewed scientific literature.18 RMIT Fact­
Lab has not corrected its erroneous ‘debunk.’19

It has also come to light that ‘independent’ Fact Checkers are not necessarily
###### financially independent from commercial interests. It was recently announced
that Meta (parent company of Facebook) will pay an undisclosed amount to
Fact Checkers including AAP and RMIT Fact-Lab for the purpose of
safeguarding the online information environment in the lead up to the Voice to
Parliament referendum.20

Moreover, documents obtained in legal discovery show that Meta has, or has
had, a commercial agreement with RMIT Fact-Lab whereby RMIT Fact-Lab
receives USD $800 from Meta per fact check, for up to 50 fact check articles
per month.21 However, this commercial arrangement is not listed on RMIT
###### Fact-Lab’s funding disclosure page on its website.22

RMIT Fact-Lab has not responded to multiple emails asking for comment on
this issue. This kind of opacity is counter to the spirit of transparency that is
considered to be fundamental to the democratic process of testing truth
claims.

-----

It is thus evident that the framing of Fact Checkers as unconflicted arbiters of
truth by both digital platforms and by government is inappropriate. It is also
potentially dangerous, [and additional examples of government disinformation]

While other forms of misinformation are left to battle it out in the information
environment on their merit, misinformation and disinformation disseminated
by Fact-Checkers are conferred with a degree of legitimacy because of their
moniker, and the authority that they have been given by the platforms that
engage them. This power imbalance has the potential to make citizens more
###### vulnerable to harms perpetuated by misinformation and disinformation
disseminated by Fact Checkers than harms perpetuated by misinformation
and disinformation from sources perceived to be less authoritative.

###### 4. Impractical and favours legacy media

**a.** **Impossibility** **of** **policing** **sites** **fairly**

###### The bill puts an onus on social media platforms to moderate misinformation or disinformation to avoid harm. But how much misinformation or disinformation equals harm? Is this just one instance of ‘suspect’ content? Should it be measured in absolute terms - no more than a certain number of comments? Or relative terms - a certain percentage? Absolute terms might make more sense on a large site where even a small percentage of overall comments might represent a large enough pool to plausibly create “harm”, but percentage might make more sense on a smaller site.

 How then should platforms monitor content to avoid being fined? Al is only a partial solution. Users of social media platforms have ways of disguising what they are saying, or inventing novel terminologies, all of which will temporarily defeat Al, or put innocent communications at risk because the Al net will have to be cast too wide.

 A further problem is when the ‘facts’ change. If misinformation and disinformation are to mean anything other than ‘what is not government information’, then understandings will change as new data and insights emerge overtime. Are platforms to retrospectively change rulings, or will they be subject to the risk of civil proceedings for defamation or other torts?

 And as governments are deemed to be incapable of misinformation and disinformation, what happens when there is a change of government?

**b.** **Barriers** **to** **entry** **to** **new** **entrants**

###### The rules will also be more onerous on small sites and new entrants who lack scale. The cost of moderation via human or artificial means will be significant, and the potential penalties even larger.

 While professional news organisations are exempted from the laws, sites such as those run by the Australians for Science and Freedom, while producing high quality, evidence-based content, could be defined by the ACMA as sources of disinformation.


-----

###### Open access journals or other innovations in discussing and disseminating scientific information would also be at risk, and at a disadvantage against established journals.

In these cases, such channels could be open to penalties that would put them
###### out of business. For example, for contravening an industry code the penalty for a corporate is up to 2 per cent of annual turnover, or $2.2 million with ACMA making the decision.

 The act also allows ACMA to impose codes on digital platforms, but this does not appear to be a risk that legacy media runs.

 ACMA can also vary “misinformation standards” on grounds it finds “reasonable” (S51). This adds an additional layer of risk to any digital media businesses not faced by their competitors.

**c.** **Establishing** **voluntary** **rules** **of** **conduct** **as** **effectively** **legislation,**
###### but without proper democratic and accountable processes for establishing them.

 This bill extends a tendency in legislation to delegate to bureaucrats via regulations powers which ought to be exercised by legislatures. This bill would effectively allow ACMA to extend definitions of harm under various state and federal human rights and anti-discrimination legislations, as well as potentially encroaching on consumer and defamation law.

 There is no evidence that ACMA has the expertise or is properly resourced to do this, or that codes of conduct should be decided outside the normal democratic process.

**5.** **Economic** **and** **scientific** **cost**

###### Societies work best and grow when there is an open and competitive structure. Regulation and uncertainty are the enemies of economic growth and human flourishing. This bill will introduce both. It will also reduce the innovation that is the key to growth.

 Digital media platforms are in one sense a source of collective thought in that they facilitate a collective conversation where different ideas can be explored and old ones replaced by better ones. By allowing a governmental instrumentality to determine what is and what isn’t disinformation and misinformation rather than the cut and thrust of conversation, and preferencing government narratives over
all others, this bill guarantees that it will be more difficult to discuss and
###### disseminate advances.

 This will come not just at a social cost, but an economic and scientific one. In an emergency situation, like a pandemic, it will tend to stifle the “gifted amateurs” who blog on these issues, and who are often the best analysts of the data that is


-----

###### available, but who would struggle to be published in mainstream media or scientific journals.

 Even for those analysts who can find mainstream publishing outlets, it still slows the process down. Scientific journals are notoriously slow to publish.

**6** **The** **legislation** **will** **not** **work,** **and** **will** **simply** **increase** **regulatory** **burden**
###### to nil effect

 Legislation of the ACMA bill will increase regulatory burden without meaningfully reducing the amount of misinformation and disinformation being shared online.

 Misinformation research conducted during the pandemic found that increased social media censorship of vaccine-sceptical content was associated with an increase in subscription to vaccine-sceptical sites and news services.23 24

 Similarly, ACMA reports that,

 “Content removal or de-platforming feeds into the general belief that platforms are involved in a deep-state ‘cover-up’. It also encourages members of conspiracy-driven communities to take steps to pro-actively avoid detection or automated content moderation tools. We Are Social found widespread use of
”24
###### intentionally misspelling keywords in posts, such as ‘vSccine’ and ‘vackseen’.

 We predict that users will simply move to private messaging channels, the dark web, and other avenues to continue sharing information, a possibility acknowledged by ACMA,

 'Widespread content moderation by the platforms may also drive these conversations further underground, by encouraging mass migrations to smaller alternative social media or encrypted messaging apps.”25

 The only measurable outcome this bill can achieve is the ACMAs expansion requiring considerable human and financial resources.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 We recommend that the bill be abandoned entirely. The need for it has not been sufficiently demonstrated, and the types of harms that it seeks to mitigate can, as far as we can tell from the details provided, be dealt with in almost all cases using existing structures in ways which guarantee individual rights are protected, without choking the necessary free flow of information. Should there be some individual harms, then they should be addressed directly and in legislation rather than through

###### Introduction


**Reasons and evidence showing the potential risks associated with the proposed**


**new powers provided to ACMA via the passage of the Communications Legislation**
**Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

The Australian Medical Professionals’ Society (AMPS) comprises a collective of medical and

allied health experts united by a core mission: safeguarding and advancing the interests of our
members and their patients, while advocating optimal health outcomes across Australia. We deeply
cherish the tenets of medical ethics, prioritising patient well-being and community welfare. As
staunch proponents of these values, AMPS enthusiastically embraces the chance to offer input to the
Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts on the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

In an era marked by the rapid dissemination of information through various channels, the

regulation of misinformation and disinformation has gained importance. Misinformation refers to the
dissemination of false or inaccurate information, often without intent to deceive. On the other hand,
disinformation involves the deliberate spread of false information to deceive and manipulate. The
potential harm stemming from misinformation and disinformation is well understood, as it can erode
public trust, misguide decision-making, and undermine societal well-being.

As governments grapple with addressing the challenges posed by misinformation, the

proposed bill's focus raises questions about potential consequences arising from censorship.
Considerations such as intellectual freedom, freedom of expression and the right of political
communication are paramount in democratic societies. Any legislation intended to address
misinformation must carefully consider the potential effects on these values. By potentially curbing
these freedoms and the ability of people to engage in open political discourse, the bill could
unintentionally infringe upon these rights, harming core pillars of our democracy.

Moreover, of concern are the bill's potential implications on healthcare practitioners' capacity

to fulfil their code of conduct requirements, duty of candour and international obligations to protect
the public. Healthcare professionals have an ethical and legal obligation to provide patients with
accurate and transparent information, enabling informed decision-making. If the bill inadvertently
hinders practitioners' ability to provide unbiased and evidence-based guidance, it could undermine the
trust between medical professionals and patients, compromising the integrity of healthcare systems.

In the pursuit of combating misinformation, it becomes crucial to assess how information

control measures might inadvertently succumb to conflicts of interest. In the intersection of healthcare
and commercial interests, a careful balance must be struck to ensure that profit motives do not dictate
the determination of truth at the expense of public health. The risk of science itself becoming a threat
to overall public health and safety, as a result of undue political or financial influence or manipulation,
underscores the need for measures that prioritise evidence-based best practices over financial gains.

Transparency and accountability are the bedrock of a functioning democracy. The access to

accurate information empowers citizens to make informed decisions, while the suppression of
information or manipulation of facts can lead to a pandemic of censorship and misinformation, posing
substantial threats to health and safety. In navigating this complex landscape, it is paramount that any


-----

legislative efforts prioritise the preservation of democratic values, transparency of data, the protection
of public health, and the integrity of information dissemination.

###### Defining Misinformation and Disinformation

According to the ACMA bill, misinformation is characterised as information that is untrue,

misleading, or deceitful and is likely to result in harm or contribute to it. Disinformation, on the other
hand, is identified as information that is false, misleading, or deceitful and is shared with the intention
to mislead, along with content that has the potential to cause or contribute to harm.

The draft bill fails to outline the criteria by which ACMA will determine the accuracy or

misleading nature of information, as well as the assessment of intent and harm. The scope of the
parameters appears excessively wide and unpractical, fostering the impression that anything not
endorsed by the government qualifies as misinformation or disinformation. Effectively, this bill seems
to criminalise any content criticising government communications, irrespective of supporting
evidence. Such a notion is disquieting and carries a chilling undertone of a dystopian scenario,
demanding profound introspection and reconsideration[1].

The prospect of a government-appointed independent body wielding the authority to

categorise information as misinformation or disinformation raises substantial concerns. Such power
gives rise to the risk of stifling dissenting viewpoints and suppressing critical discourse. In an arena
where scientific understanding is perpetually evolving and often influenced by vested interests,
determining what constitutes accurate information becomes exceedingly complex. The potential for
bias and manipulation becomes pronounced when an entity is asked to make these determinations,
potentially sacrificing objectivity in favour of political or economic agendas[2]. The fluid nature of
scientific discovery and the presence of diverse perspectives necessitate caution when vesting a single
entity with the power to define truth, as this approach could inadvertently curtail the intellectual
freedom and right of political communication of practitioners and hinder open dialogue essential for
societal progress.

Governments must be aware of the often deceptive practices of large pharmaceutical

companies that have paid gigantic fines for fraud, illegal marketing, ghost writing and

misrepresentation of research results. The influential power of the pharmaceutical industry to control
what constitutes mis and dis information must not be dismissed as Peter Gøtzsche, founder of the
Cochrane Collaboration, discusses in his book Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big
Pharma has Corrupted Healthcare.

“There can be no doubt that its business model fulfills the criteria for organised crime”.
Gøtzsche is not alone in comparing the pharmaceutical industry to an organized criminal
enterprise. In a striking passage, Gøtzsche quotes Peter Rost, a former Pfizer marketing vice
president, as follows:

It is scary how many similarities there are between this industry and the mob. The mob
makes obscene amounts of money, as does this industry. The side effects of organized crime
are killings and deaths, and the side effects are the same in this industry. The mob bribes
politicians and others, and so does the drug industry….[3]”

Recommendation: It is our stance that the bill should not be approved. Establishing precise
definitions for misinformation and disinformation is a formidable challenge given the ever-evolving
landscape of scientific knowledge and increasing financial conflicts of interest.

###### Defining Harm

AMPS as a collective of committed health professionals and scientists, hold serious concerns

regarding the potential repercussions of granting a government-appointed entity the authority to
regulate the open dissemination of information under the vague guise of harm mitigation.

For example, throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, any scepticism toward

government-endorsed public health messaging was promptly labelled as the dissemination of
misinformation or disinformation. Unfortunately, with the passage of time, it has become evident that
much of the officially sanctioned government communication — spanning from the lab leak theory to
mask usage, lockdowns, and the effectiveness of vaccines in stopping transmission — was riddled
with inaccuracies and misdirection, whether by oversight or design. The submission by AMPS to the
Independent Panel Review outlined our conviction that the coercive measures taken in response to the
pandemic contradicted both historical precedents and scientific consensus[4]. The rationale behind
implementing societal interventions that were both unscientific and unjustified remains puzzling. Not
only did the secret health advice seem to contradict established international and national pandemic
strategies, but it also transgressed medical ethical standards and Australia's obligations to uphold civil
and political rights.

These ACMA powers, purportedly established to avert "harm," come with a vagueness in

defining harm and an absence of clarity regarding the threshold. Nevertheless, as exemplified by the
response to the pandemic, entrusting the government as the sole purveyor of truth for the sake of
public "safety" carries the potential to result in harm, especially in cases of policy missteps that evade
questioning[56]. The suppression of scientific discourse stifles the open exchange of scientific ideas and
undermines evidence-based medicine, impeding scientific advancement and the continual pursuit of
best practices. Further, it exposes policy makers to the risk of being influenced by potent political and
financial forces, especially when the capacity for information sharing among frontline workers and
less influential member-based associations is severely restricted[78].

Employing the threat of disciplinary measures will inevitably induce silence through the

imposition of compliance driven by fear. However, healthcare professionals bear a responsibility to
exercise their intellectual autonomy and the right to political expression, voicing concerns to
safeguard patients and the general public when their clinical insight and the most pertinent evidence
suggest potential harm stemming from governmental policies[9]. The notion that upholding the
perception of government-declared truths is of paramount importance to preserve public stability,
even when data and evidence highlight issues, marks a distressing departure both from the principles
of ethical evidence based medicine and from the foundations of democracy.

In a recent ruling involving the Biden vs. Missouri case, Judge Doughty meticulously

expounded upon the collaboration between the government and social media platforms aimed at
dictating the permissible content for the public to consume. Recent Freedom of Information
documents unveiled that our Department of Home Affairs employed tactics to suppress information,
controlling Australians' access to informed decision-making about policies and medical

interventions[10]. Judge Doughty reaffirmed that the primary objective of free speech is to safeguard an
open marketplace of ideas, where truth prevails without hindrance. Within the context of this case's
verdict, he presented compelling evidence that supports the claims brought forth by the plaintiffs,
stating:

“Defendants, through public pressure campaigns, private meetings, and other forms of direct
communication, regarding what Defendants described as “disinformation,” “misinformation,”
and “malinformation,” have colluded with and/or coerced social media platforms[11].”

The ruling vividly underscores the perils that arise when citizens are denied unfettered access

to information, hindering their ability to make autonomous decisions. The stifling of speech,
intellectual freedom, and political expression has a cascading effect on nearly all other liberties. It's
evident that governments globally, including the Australian government, leveraged their authority to
quash any opposition to their Covid-related policies. Amid a period of profound uncertainty, rather
than engaging with frontline healthcare professionals as laid out in our pre-pandemic preparedness
strategies, government regulatory bodies instead persecuted medical and health experts who exercised
their clinical judgement and relied on the best available evidence to scrutinise policies they deemed
potentially hazardous to the well-being of all Australians[12]. The AMPS contends that this approach
has indeed led to harm among Australians.

The censorship of scientific discourse via the politicisation of the scientific method, as we

have witnessed during the COVID-19 era, holds the potential to cause severe actual and potential
harm to public health and well-being[13]. When a government-designated body dictates the
dissemination of information, controlling what citizens perceive as true despite emerging data and
evidence, it suggests that the integrity of our democratic processes has already been compromised.

###### Constitutional considerations

The proposed ACMA bill raises important constitutional concerns, particularly in relation to

potential censorship of health professionals. The bill's provisions that seek to combat misinformation
might inadvertently infringe upon the constitutional freedom of political communication, which is
considered implied in the Australian Constitution[14]. This could have far-reaching implications,
especially for health professionals engaging in public discourse about critical health matters, such as
COVID-19. The right of health professionals to provide evidence-based information and opinions is
crucial for informed public debate and decision-making. Censorship of such communication could
hinder the public's access to accurate health information, thereby conflicting with the democratic
principles that underpin Australia's legal framework[15]. To strike a balance between curbing
misinformation and upholding the constitutionally protected right to political communication and free
expression remains a complex challenge that necessitates careful consideration and thorough legal
analysis.

Furthermore, the proposed ACMA bill has the potential to damage intellectual freedom, a

cornerstone of democratic societies. By providing authorities with the power to determine and censor
content deemed as misinformation, the bill risks stifling diverse perspectives and legitimate discourse.
Intellectual freedom thrives on the unrestricted exchange of ideas, even those that challenge prevailing
norms. If the bill were to impose restrictions on information sharing, it could deter people from
expressing unconventional viewpoints or engaging in critical discussions for fear of reprisal. This is a
legitimate fear of many practitioners who have seen the personal career consequences of speaking out
following the adoption of the 9 March 2021 position statement from AHPRA and National Boards; it
threatened registration investigation and disciplinary action for saying anything that would undermine
the government public health messaging and vaccination rollout.[16]. A robust democracy relies on the
ability of citizens to engage in open debates, form their opinions, and contribute to collective
decision-making. Curtailing intellectual freedom not only limits the growth of knowledge but also
undermines the essence of democratic values and citizen participation in shaping their society's future.
It is imperative that any legislative efforts to combat misinformation are carefully crafted to avoid
inadvertently infringing upon this fundamental aspect of democracy[17].


Intellectual freedom is one of the modern marvels of living in a liberal democracy and brings


tremendous benefit to society, as affirmed by the High Court:


“Once developed, justification for intellectual freedom is instrumental. The instrumental
justification is the search for truth in the contested marketplace of ideas, the social importance
of which Frankfurter J spoke powerfully about.[18]”

###### Conflicts of interest must be considered in defining Misinformation and Disinformation.

Granting a government-appointed entity the authority to label information contradicting

official messaging as misinformation or disinformation establishes an alarming and precarious
precedent[19]. This becomes especially concerning considering the growing awareness of the effect of
corporate conflicts of interest, leading to biassed reporting within academia, biassed media content,
skewed therapeutic guidelines, and profit-driven public policies. History is replete with instances
showcasing the consequences of authorities making decisions without being held accountable or
having to be transparent about their actions. This is particularly concerning when policies, based on
concealed health advice for instance, are determined by those in power without the requirement for
empirical validation, effectively bestowing them the power to define what qualifies as true
information.

The extensive sway exerted by pharmaceutical companies' financial interests across medical

academia and public policy presents a notable jeopardy to the credibility of healthcare and societal
welfare. The involvement of pharmaceutical companies in financing research, regulation, education,
and policy endeavours introduces an intrinsic susceptibility to bias, potentially undermining the
impartiality of scientific investigation and policy development[2021]. This dynamic could result in an
undue prioritisation of profit-centred incentives, overshadowing the imperative of prioritising patient
well-being and the broader public health.

Professor Ioannidis describes what he calls a "misinformation mess" where he claims much

published research is not reliable. Having to negotiate such a mess in deciding exactly what is
misinformation offers no benefit to patients or decision makers. It is a risk to public health.[22]. The
government must consider that many prominent journal editors have drawn attention to the pervasive
influence of financial conflicts of interest on the reliability of research findings. "Financial conflicts
can compromise the integrity of research," warns Dr. Fiona Godlee, editor-in-chief of The BMJ,
stressing the potential bias that can result from industry funding[23]. Dr. Jerome Kassirer, former
[editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, notes in his book, How medicine's](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5jsiffLtnm8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&ots=NGtZ9h_Twj&sig=GSyrdZpMlxvBJ09_csCrBTjZ8D0)

Medicine, adds, disclosure alone is insufficient to address conflicts, emphasising the need for greater
transparency and safeguards against undue influence[25]. Dr Maria Angell, long time editor in chief of
the NEJM resigned more than 20 years ago after 20 years as editor because of what she described as
the rising influence of the Pharmaceutical industry. She said in her book, The truth about drug
companies: How they deceive us and what to do about it, “Now primarily a marketing machine to sell
drugs of dubious benefit, big pharma uses it wealth and power to co-opt every institution that might
stand in its way, including the US congress, the FDA, academic medical centers and the medical
profession itself[26].” These editorial voices collectively emphasise the imperative of robust disclosure
mechanisms and stringent evaluation of financial conflicts to maintain the integrity and credibility of
research in the face of commercial interests.

The AMPS would argue that the demonisation of ivermectin during the pandemic is a prime

example of how financial conflicts of interests that claimed extensive evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of ivermectin in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 resulted in harm. Our
submission to the TGA’s rescheduling of ivermectin showed how statistically significant the evidence
base is to support the clinical improvements in time to clinical recovery, time to viral clearance and
reduction in hospitalisation and death from this cheap, safe, fully approved, WHO essential
medicine[27]. This medication was banned by the TGA claiming safety and efficacy concerns when their
own 2013 Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPAR) demonstrated safety and instead
recommended for example the use of provisionally approved very expensive Remdesivir. Remdesivir
in the WHO Solidarity Trial reported in the NEJM was found to have “little or no effect on
hospitalised patients with COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and
duration of hospital stay[28]”. In fact, in 2020 the WHO recommended against the use of remdesivir in
COVID-19 patients[29]. A study in the Lancet from September 2021 found, “No clinical benefit was
observed from the use of remdesivir in patients who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19, were
symptomatic for more than 7 days, and required oxygen support[30].” The banning of ivermectin in
favour of antivirals such as remdesivir appears to make little evidentiary or clinical sense.

Dr Mike Magee, former physician spokesman for Pfizer, published in 2019 his book Code Blue:

“Cozy relationships and generous gratuities have demonstrated a remarkable ability to corrupt
even those we would instinctively put on the side of the angels, including members of the
biomedical research community, deans of medical schools, directors of continuing medical
education programs, officers at the NIH and FDA, and even seemingly altruistic patient
advocacy organizations like the American Cancer Society[31].”

The AMPS has also written quite extensively about our concerns about the conflict between

comprehensive safety and efficacy data surrounding these novel immunisations. While the accelerated
development and emergency approvals were motivated by the global health crisis, some experts
caution that the available data are not yet as extensive as in standard vaccine development processes.
The AMPS has written about our concerns with these vaccines especially for children[32]. According to
our Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) AusPAR long-term safety data remains a critical gap in
our understanding, emphasising the importance of continued post-vaccination pharmacovigilance. Dr.
Peter Doshi, an associate editor at The BMJ, underscores the need for transparent and thorough
reporting of clinical trial results to ensure the public's confidence in these vaccines[33]. Amid the
urgency to address the pandemic, it remains essential to strike a balance between expediency and the
collection of robust data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the safety and efficacy profiles
of COVID-19 vaccines[34].

Financial conflicts of interest can erode trust in medical research, undermine the credibility of

academic institutions, restrict access to transparent data and ultimately result in the promotion of
treatments or policies that prioritise corporate gain over the impartial pursuit of knowledge and the
advancement of public welfare. Stricter safeguards and transparency measures are essential to
mitigate these dangers and ensure that medical academia and public policy remain steadfastly
committed to unbiased and evidence-based decision-making when seeking to define what constitutes
mis or dis information.

Recommendation: We advise against the passage of this bill in light of the growing corporate
conflicts of interest. Such conflicts can lead to biassed reporting in academia, media content,
skewed therapeutic guidelines, and profit-driven public policies which pose a clear and present
danger to public health and safety.

###### International obligations and national code of conduct requirements

The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency sets out codes of conduct under section

39 of the National Law. The Good Medical Practice Code of Conduct complements the Australian
Medical Association Code of ethics and is aligned with its values. It is also consistent with the
Declaration of Geneva and the International code of medical ethics, issued by the World Medical
Association[35].

It is important that practitioners and policy makers are aware of the national and international

duties and obligations of health professionals in the care of patients and their community. The AMPS
is of the belief that these new powers will likely result in a conflict between patient advocacy and
adherence to government policy. The code states, In clinical practice, the care of your patient is your
primary concern. The Declaration of Geneva and the International code of ethics as well as the
UNESCO Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Bioethics repeatedly highlight the critical
importance of the individual patient, to act honestly with integrity, valuing human life and promoting

and safeguarding the health of patients and the public. Consequently, where the data and evidence are
demonstrating policy error leading to harm to individual patients and the public practitioners have an
ethical obligation to share that information. It is dangerous to conclude that because the information
contradicts the government or the so-called consensus it is misinformation[36].

Doctors hold a crucial international obligation to provide their patients with informed consent,

a cornerstone of medical ethics and human rights. Informed consent ensures that patients have the
right to make autonomous decisions about their healthcare by being fully informed of the risks,
benefits, and alternatives to a proposed medical intervention. This principle is enshrined in
international ethical guidelines, including the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki
and UNESCO's Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. Respect for patients'
autonomy and dignity demands that healthcare professionals communicate transparently, allowing
patients to weigh the potential consequences of their choices. This commitment transcends national
borders and cultures, reinforcing the global imperative for doctors to uphold the right to informed
consent as a fundamental aspect of responsible and patient-centred medical practice[373839].

Doctor's also have a duty of candour which is a vital ethical principle that underscores their

responsibility to maintain open and honest communication with patients. Rooted in the commitment to
patient welfare and respect for autonomy, this duty requires physicians to provide accurate,
comprehensive, and understandable information to patients about their medical condition, treatment
options, potential risks, and benefits[40]. By fostering transparency and promoting informed
decision-making, the duty of candour builds trust between doctors and patients and empowers
individuals to actively participate in their healthcare journey. This obligation reflects the fundamental
respect for patient autonomy, ensuring that people have the information necessary to make
well-informed choices that align with their values and preferences[41].

The AMPS in consultation with our membership have tried to engage with our political and

medical leaders as well as engage with the public to share scientific information that shows harmful
public health policies. We, like many others, have found ourselves fighting the censorship-political
complex, in an attempt to protect the public[42]. It defies comprehension that AHPRA and national
boards, entrusted to ensure public safety, have stated it is not within their mandate to evaluate the
scientific validity of statements or exemptions, but only to assess whether the statements or
exemptions go against the Public Health Orders[43]. As an association of dedicated health practitioners
that have become more and more aware of the effect of financial conflicts of interests on the integrity
of medical academia, media reporting, pharmacological policy and guidelines, we have serious
concerns that this corruption of science is a threat to public health and safety. It is critical that
regulators evaluate presented evidence with an awareness of potential corrupting influences to fulfil
their mandate to protect the public.

Our association's concerns were outlined clearly in a BMJ article by executive editor Kamran

Abbasi titled Covid-19: Politicisation, “corruption,” and suppression of science. When good science is
suppressed by the medical-political complex, people die.

“Science is being suppressed for political and financial gain. Covid-19 has unleashed

state corruption on a grand scale, and it is harmful to public health. Politicians and industry
are responsible for this opportunistic embezzlement. So too are scientists and health experts.
The pandemic has revealed how the medical-political complex can be manipulated in an
emergency—a time when it is even more important to safeguard science…
… Importantly, suppressing science, whether by delaying publication, cherry picking
favourable research, or gagging scientists, is a danger to public health, causing deaths by
exposing people to unsafe or ineffective interventions and preventing them from benefiting
from better ones. When entangled with commercial decisions it is also maladministration of
taxpayers’ money….
…The medical-political complex tends towards suppression of science to aggrandise and
enrich those in power. And, as the powerful become more successful, richer, and further
intoxicated with power, the inconvenient truths of science are suppressed. When good science
is suppressed, people die[44].”

Recent years have unveiled the extent of corruption within the scientific realm, demonstrating

the perils of censorship and underscoring the vital necessity of practitioners preserving their codes of
conduct in harmony with intellectual freedom and the right to political communication, all to ensure
the safeguarding of the public. Without strong medical and ethical boundaries it is easy to see how
science itself can be weaponised by financial and political entanglement to become a threat to public
health. There must be transparency and accountability and open scientific discourse in the search for
ethical evidence based best practice.

The expansion of ACMA powers could exacerbate the erosion of public trust in the

government, particularly as increasing numbers of citizens recognize the extent of orchestrated
information manipulation and concerning conflicts of interest that have shaped policy decisions
throughout the Covid era. Censorship and the tenets of science stand in fundamental opposition.
Healthcare professionals must retain the freedom to exercise their clinical discernment, guided by the
most robust evidence and data, aligned with ethical codes and international principles, all without fear
of retaliation, in order to safeguard their patients and society at large.

Recommendation: We advise against the passage of this bill as we believe that any well intentioned
perceived benefits from censoring information are outweighed by the risks posed by information
corruption which undermines practitioner obligations. Transparent open access to evidence and raw
data is vital to provide patients with valid informed consent and to ensure public protection through
accurate policy formulation unhindered by financial, corporate and political interests.

###### Truth and transparency in public health are important for public trust and safety

In a period where the contentious nature of the Covid policy response has become evident,

and the enforced communication has been marred by inaccuracies while stifling opposing voices to
the detriment of public trust, it becomes apparent that the notion of "public health and safety" has
been manipulated by regulators to encompass any statement conflicting with government health
directives or messaging, regardless of the scientific backing presented. These authorities have wielded
these powers to exert control over healthcare professionals, thereby clashing with their ethical
responsibilities and code of conduct commitments. If these ACMA powers are introduced, they
possess the capability to further solidify the trends observed during the Covid era, where adhering
strictly to "the science" often entailed suppressing open dialogue.

Transparency and accountability serve as cornerstone principles in maintaining trust within

the realm of public health. By openly sharing information, data, and decision-making processes,
authorities foster an environment of clarity and honesty, reassuring the public that decisions are made
with their best interests in mind. When actions are grounded in transparency, individuals can evaluate
the basis for policies, interventions, and recommendations, leading to informed consent and a greater
sense of agency. Furthermore, accountability ensures that those in positions of authority remain
responsible for their decisions and actions, deterring unethical practices and fostering confidence in
the integrity of the public health system. Ultimately, transparency and accountability collectively
contribute to the establishment of a trustworthy foundation upon which individuals can confidently
rely for the protection and promotion of their well-being[45].

Recommendation: We advise against the passage of this bill because transparency of data and
evidence is required to maintain trust in the validity of policy recommendations. Censorship has
been used liberally during the pandemic to create support for government messaging and this has
been disastrous for public confidence in public health.

###### A Pandemic of Censorship

The government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been marred by an unprecedented

level of censorship and the stigmatisation of dissenting viewpoints grounded in scientific evidence.
While the intention behind tightly controlling public information was likely to prioritise people's
safety, the unintended consequence has been an erosion of the principles of informed consent and the
infliction of harm[46]. Troublingly, it's becoming increasingly evident that contentious narratives, such
as the origin of COVID-19 from the Wuhan wet market and the effectiveness of vaccines in curbing
transmission, were suppressed in favour of what might be termed as well-intentioned falsehoods,
aimed at preserving public order and social cohesion. The orchestrated manipulation of scientific
consensus highlights a concerted effort by politicians, medical authorities, and governments to bolster
public trust in official communications and alleviate vaccine hesitancy.

Nonetheless, within the realm of science, achieving absolute consensus is a rarity; indeed, the

very essence of science hinges on its perpetually evolving nature. As underscored by Aaron Kheriaty,
an Ethics and Public Policy Center fellow and former Associate Professor of psychiatry and human
behaviour at the University of California, "Science represents an incessant pursuit of truth, and such
truth remains largely detached from consensus. Progress in significant scientific breakthroughs
invariably entails the questioning of established norms. Those who uphold scientific consensus over
specific empirical discoveries aren't championing science but rather embracing a form of bias[47]."

The policies formulated, executed, and subsequently enforced in reaction to COVID-19 stood

in stark contrast to the pre-pandemic readiness strategies. Measures like lockdowns, border closures,
mask mandates, school shutdowns, and compulsory vaccine directives were not part of the initial
recommendations[48]. Similarly, the utilisation of dubious and ethically questionable psychological
tactics through nudge units, aimed at invoking fear, shame, and guilt to increase compliance, was not
advised[49]. The actions demonstrated by authorities in recent times are undeniably disconcerting and
represent an evident and imminent risk to public confidence and trust in matters concerning public
health.

The health guidance forming the foundation for policy decisions has remained concealed, a

secrecy that persists. This lack of transparency, coupled with the absence of open scrutiny of the
scientific evidence, has done more than just erode trust in numerous institutions, authorities and
healthcare experts. We need to remember Abassi’s warning, that it is nothing less than the loss of life
that all too often follows the merging of medical and political forces. Sustaining public and
professional trust hinges on the availability of science for critical examination, devoid of political
influence, while maintaining transparency and preventing conflicts of interest from tainting the
system[50].

Practitioners who dared to question "the science" or offered a risk-benefit analysis, discussing

potential pandemic policy drawbacks, faced and continue to face threats of investigation and punitive
measures from AHPRA and National Boards. Regulatory bodies have targeted them as threats to
public health and safety as a result of their failure to unquestioningly adhere to public health
directives. Questioning policy or providing patients advice using clinical judgement and the best
available evidence is perceived as undermining the authority's stance on promoting COVID-19
vaccination and eroding public confidence in government health messaging[51]. However, regulators, as
per their own statements, do not deem it their responsibility to assess the scientific credibility of
statements or exemptions. Instead, their role is solely to ascertain whether such statements or
exemptions contravene the Public Health Orders.

It is a contradiction to both logic and ethics, as well as a departure from the scientific method,

that these healthcare professionals are confronted with threats for scrutinising policies that many now
acknowledge as unscientific, baseless, and detrimental. Health indicators underscore that the
pandemic measures implemented with extensive censorship have led, and continue to lead, to more

harm than good[52]. Presently, we are observing alarming levels of excess mortality, reduced fertility
rates, setbacks in education and development, the devastating effect on small businesses and the
economy — outcomes that can largely be attributed to many of these enforced pandemic policies. The
emerging data might be revealing the most substantial damage to public health, the economy, and
overall societal well-being witnessed in a generation. In a recent paper featuring the esteemed
Stanford Professor Ioannidis, it is highlighted that the myopic and sometimes biassed viewpoints of
certain scientists and "influencers" played a role in justifying COVID-19 policies that imposed
sacrifice, deprivation, and suffering across all segments of society, affecting millions of lives[53].

Digital platforms at the behest of governments engaged in removing, shadow banning, or

concealing content that governments deemed misinformation or disinformation. Much of this content,
however, turned out to be accurate at the time or subject to continuing scientific discourse. Material
that challenged the officially endorsed public health messages was dismissed as false or
conspiratorial, even when supported by evidence. With the passage of time, it's become evident that
the primary source of misinformation emanated from the government itself — encompassing topics
like the lab leak theory, mask efficacy, lockdowns, and the effect of vaccines on transmission[54]. This
misinformation disseminated from the government subsequently permeated the media and the
healthcare sphere. Through tactics involving threats, coercion, fear, and shame, a systematic campaign
of suppression was orchestrated to stifle scientific discussion and engineer a contrived scientific
consensus[55]. Government officials effectively positioned themselves as the sole arbiters of truth, and
anyone — be it scientists, doctors, politicians, or citizens — who challenged this authoritative
narrative with scientific evidence and data were met with shaming, deplatforming, and suspension, all
under the guise of safeguarding public safety[56].

An orchestrated campaign of censorship holds the potential to intricately mould messaging,

thereby swaying a population's perception of what constitutes accurate information. While such
measures might ostensibly contribute to maintaining societal harmony, they do so at the expense of
individual liberty, to say nothing of truth. Managing information to manipulate public perception into
accepting government policies as safety-enhancing stands in stark contrast to enabling the unimpeded
exchange of information, which empowers individuals to assess evidence and data autonomously,
leading to informed decision-making.

According to a 2012 report commissioned by the Gillard government and written by Federal

Court Judge Ray Finkelstein, it was noted that "citizens must have the capacity to engage in debate, in
the form of relevant critical reasoning and speaking skills…” He went on to say there is “real doubt as
to whether these capacities are present for all, or even most, citizens[57]." In recent years, our political,
bureaucratic, and medical authorities have utilised governmental entities and funding to oversee and
regulate the information accessible to the public. AMPS asserts that if the government appoints bodies
like ACMA as their public relations and marketing team because of a perceived inability of the public
to differentiate between differing viewpoints, it could be argued that damage to the integrity of
Australia's democratic processes has already made substantial headway. Censorship is inherently

non-democratic; it aligns with the sentiment of German-American political philosopher Eric Voegelin
who stated that it's "the common feature of all totalitarian systems...the prohibition of questions[58]."

Recommendation: We strongly recommend not proceeding with the enactment of this bill, primarily
as a result of the substantial inherent risks it poses to ethical evidence-based medicine and the
broader public health. This viewpoint is substantiated by the Actuaries Institute's remarkable excess
mortality data, which appears to have a tight temporal link between these rising mortalities and the
measures adopted during the pandemic.[59].

###### Conclusion

In conclusion, the battle against misinformation and disinformation is a critical endeavour that

requires a delicate balance between preserving constitutional values, upholding professional ethics,
and safeguarding public health. The bill's potential damage to constitutional principles like intellectual
freedom and the right of political communication must be carefully scrutinised. Equally important is
the consideration of how healthcare practitioners' ability to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities
might be affected. Striking this balance involves a keen awareness of the potential for conflicts of
interest to sway the pursuit of truth and best practices.

Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of a functioning democratic society. It is

imperative that any measures taken to control information uphold these foundational principles, and
ensure that information dissemination remains free from undue influence and manipulation.
Ultimately, the convergence of misinformation, constitutional considerations, and healthcare
responsibilities underscores the complexity of the issue at hand.

As societies navigate the evolving landscape of information in the digital age, it is essential to

preserve democratic values, uphold professional ethics, and prioritise public health. Censorship is
anathema to a free and democratic society. The only way to cope with mis or disinformation is to
encourage more debate and create a society where critical thinking and intellectual curiosity is the
norm. The AMPS believes the censorship risks associated with the proposed ACMA bill do not
outweigh the benefits and therefore it should not be adopted.

The concluding Judgment's in the Biden vs Missouri case succinctly encapsulates the

concerns held by AMPS members regarding the authority vested in government-appointed
independent entities to determine the validity or appropriateness of information accessible to the
public.

"As a government commits to stifling opposing voices, it inevitably descends down a path of
increasingly authoritarian measures, leading eventually to becoming a source of terror[60]."

###### My recommendation is that this “ Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023....” bill be abandoned entirely.

I support both (a) Australians for Science and Freedom submission dated 20 Aug
###### 2023 and (b) the Australian Medical Professionals' Society (AMPS ) submission dated 20 Aug 2023 prepared by Associate Professor Christopher Neil MBBS FRACP PhD, Kara Thomas BNurs GCertNurs Mlntl&ComnDev, Dr Duncan Syme MBBS FRACGP DROCG Dip Prac Dermatology (University of Cardiff), Dr Jeyanthi Kunadhasan MD(UKM) MMED(UM) FANZCA MMED(Monash) on behalf of the Australian Medical Professionals Society

I add the following extra points

###### (1) The solution and answer to bad/ poor/ wrong speech is MORE speech so that the truth will come out in the marketplace of ideas Free speech is paramount without boundaries.
 (2) The government does not have a monopoly on truth as the government just as the rest of society is composed of fallible humans (none of who are perfect)
 Hence absolute Free speech will enable the truth to be tested in the marketplace of ideas

 (3) The exclusion of information from government, approved institutions and the press from the regulatory reach of the bill, coupled with the assumption that misinformation and disinformation (from non-government or non- institutionally-approved sources only) can cause a broad range of harms, implies practical application that looks something like,

‘The policies of governments and peak/governing bodies save lives and are
###### intrinsically good for the nation, or the world. Ergo, any information counter to these policies threatens lives and causes harm.’
 When adopted in the marketplace, policies underwritten by such logic read like YouTube’s medical misinformation rules, which categorise as misinformation any information that, “contradicts local health authorities’ (LHA’s) or the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance about specific health conditions and substances.”
 As Michael Shellenberger pointed out earlier this week, if YouTube had existed over the past 200 years, then under such a policy they would have banned criticisms of blood-letting, thalidomide, lobotomies, and sterilising the mentally ill, all of which were recommended by official health authorities at one point in time.

 Should ACMA’s bill pass in its current form and become law, digital platforms will be compelled to take a similar line. This is not only flawed, it’s dangerous.
