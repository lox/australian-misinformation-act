# Feedback on Communications Legislation Amendment
 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

_Summary:_

Democracy requires open debate which can only exist in an environment where the
free exchange of information and opinions is allowed.

All individuals have the right to discern truth from falsehood through reason and
conscience, as per the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Where governments have legislated against the free exchange of information and
curtailed the right of the individual to discern the truth for themselves, abuses of
power have inevitably ensued and have resulted in some of the worst tragedies in the
history of humanity.

The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 should be rejected in its entirety.

The essence of democracy lies in open debate, free expression, and the pursuit of truth.
Legislation banning so-called 'misinformation' and 'disinformation' has the potential to stifle
free speech and suppress alternative voices. While proponents argue that such laws are
necessary to combat the spread of 'harmful falsehoods', history provides numerous
cautionary tales of the dangers inherent in granting governments the power to control
information and silence opposing viewpoints, and modern dictatorships likewise provide a
clear warning.

Examining historical dictatorships and current totalitarian regimes can shed light on the dire
consequences of such legislation and emphasize the vital importance of protecting open
debate and truth-seeking in Australia.

1. Italy under Benito Mussolini.

Benito Mussolini's fascist regime tightly controlled the media and suppressed any criticism
of the government. The regime's laws restricted freedom of the press and punished
journalists who opposed the fascist party.

The Law for the Defence of the State (1926) stated: "Anyone who spreads false news that
is likely to disturb public order shall be punished by imprisonment."

This law aimed to suppress critical reporting and control information. It provided
authorities with the power to punish individuals and shut down news outlets who spread

what the government considered false news, leading to a climate of self-censorship and
fear among media professionals and thereby suppressing alternative narratives and
opinions.

2. Chile under Augusto Pinochet.

The Decree Law 77 (1973) stated: "Anyone who spreads false or tendentious news or
malicious rumours, knowing that they are false or with reckless disregard for the truth,
shall be punished with imprisonment."

This law was enacted shortly after the military coup led by Augusto Pinochet. It aimed to
suppress information and control the narrative by punishing the spread of false or
misleading news, giving the government broad powers to silence dissent and control
information flow.

3. Germany under Adolf Hitler.

The Law against the Misuse of Radio Receivers (1933) stated: "Whoever listens to foreign
radio stations or spreads their news... will be punished with imprisonment."

This law aimed to control the dissemination of information and limit access to foreign
sources of news. It sought to prevent the German population from accessing alternative
perspectives and counter-narratives that could challenge the Nazi regime.

Furthermore, Adolf Hitler and his party utilized the Reich Press Law of 1933 to silence
opposition and control information. The law allowed the government to shut down
publications that were critical of the Nazi regime or promoted ideas deemed contrary to
Nazi ideology.

The White Rose resistance group, composed mainly of university students and professors,
distributed anti-Nazi leaflets and were eventually arrested and executed in 1943 for
spreading "subversive" information.

4. Soviet Union (Russia) under Joseph Stalin.

The Soviet Union under Stalin’s rule is infamous for its strict censorship laws. The Soviet
government controlled the media and prohibited any criticism of the Communist Party or
its leaders. The Soviet Penal Code, Article 58 (1927), criminalised a wide range of so-called
"counter-revolutionary activities" including anti-Soviet propaganda, criticism of the
government, and any perceived threats to the Communist regime.

The vague and broad language of the article allowed authorities to interpret any form of
criticism or dissent as a threat to the state. Countless individuals, including intellectuals,
artists, writers, political activists, and ordinary citizens, were arrested, imprisoned, or
executed based on their expression of views that contradicted the official government
narrative. The fear of being labelled "counter-revolutionary" or "anti-Soviet" stifled open
debate and genuine discussions of ideas, as individuals feared the severe consequences
that could result from expressing dissenting opinions.

Control over information allowed the government to shape public perception and
maintain a facade of stability and progress while concealing the human toll of policies such
as forced collectivization, purges, and mass executions, with some historians attributing
20 million deaths to Stalin’s rule.

5. Cambodia under Pol Pot.

The Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, sought to establish an agrarian communist state
and executed a genocidal campaign against perceived enemies, intellectuals, and
dissenters. The regime imposed strict censorship, shutting down newspapers, radio
stations, and universities. Intellectuals and educated individuals were targeted and often
executed for possessing "bourgeois" knowledge or expressing opposing views. Mass
executions and forced labour camps leading to the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million
people, approximately 25% of the Cambodian population at the time.

Leadership issued directives and orders that outlined their policies and instructions. These
documents were not widely distributed and were often kept confidential within the party
leadership. The Cambodian example underscores that when governments are granted
unchecked authority to determine what constitutes misinformation, they risk abusing that
power to consolidate control, suppress criticism, and curtail citizens' rights.

6. China (current).

The Chinese Communist Party maintains a strict control over the nature and sources of
information the citizens of China have access to. Censorship laws heavily regulate online
content, social media, and traditional media outlets, and the Great Firewall of China
prevents access to many international websites and platforms, limiting access to
alternative perspectives.

The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China (Article 181 – 1997) states:

Whoever fabricates or deliberately spreads false information to disturb
public order or disrupt social stability is to be sentenced to not more than
three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; and
may also be sentenced to a fine.

This and similar legislation can be broadly interpreted, allowing authorities to target and
suppress a wide range of information and punish journalists and individuals who share or
access that information. Law enforcement agencies and a complex, interconnected Social
Credit System, provide the framework for behaviour control and self-censorship among
the citizenry. One clear example of the result of these 'misinformation' laws and their
enforcement is the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of Falun Gong practitioners,
where countless individuals have been arrested, tortured, and even killed for promoting
beliefs that the government deems "subversive."

Further, the "Regulations on De-Extremification" and the "Counter-Terrorism Law" (2017)
are examples of laws that have been used to justify the suppression of information in the
name of combating extremism and terrorism. These laws can be interpreted broadly to

target any content deemed to promote "extremist" or "separatist" ideas. This approach
extends to religious content and has been applied to expressions of Uighur identity,
culture, or religious practices. Indeed, the Chinese authorities have been accused of
detaining Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in what they refer to as "re-education
centres" or "vocational training centres." International organizations, human rights
groups, and media outlets have reported on allegations of widespread human rights
abuses, including forced labour, forced assimilation, mass surveillance, religious
suppression, and even torture within these centres.

7. Myanmar (current).

In Myanmar, the military junta has implemented severe restrictions on media and internet
access, making it challenging for citizens to access independent information and challenge
the government's narrative. Further, legislation has been enacted to control information,
with vague language that has been exploited to suppress legitimate expressions of speech
and dissent.

The Penal Code (Section 505A – 2013) states:

Whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report
with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public
or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to
commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity shall
be punished with imprisonment which may extend to two years or with fine
or with both.

Myanmar is now the world's second biggest jailer of journalists, after China. Authorities
operating under the Penal Code arrest those who attend and attempt to cover public
protests, while intelligence services routinely track down and imprison journalists who
may have reported unfavourably on government actions. Journalists, such as Wa Lone and
Kyaw Soe Oo, were imprisoned in Myanmar for their reporting on the military's actions
against the Rohingya minority. The same legislation has also been used to withdraw
broadcasting licences from independent news organisations, further restricting and
delegitimising any alternative points of view.

8. North Korea (current).

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is one of the most repressive regimes in
modern history. The state exercises complete control over media and communications,
using censorship laws to restrict access to information and suppress dissent.

The Criminal Code (Article 62 – 2015) states:

A person who has spread incitement or propaganda with a purpose against
the nation shall be sentenced to a term of reform through labour of less than
5 years. In particularly grave cases, he or she shall be sentenced to a term of
reform through labour of more than 5 years and less than 10 years.

In addition, the Criminal Code prohibits listening to foreign radio broadcasts or possessing
publications from South Korea or other foreign countries. Violators face severe
punishments, including incarceration in forced labour camps and, according to reports
from defectors, torture and execution. The government utilizes fear and violence to
maintain control, creating a climate where alternative viewpoints are virtually nonexistent, and citizens are isolated from the outside world.

These historical and current examples demonstrate what can happen when a country
implements legislation banning 'misinformation' and 'disinformation.' Individuals have been
incarcerated, tortured, or even killed, sometimes _en masse, for expressing their views or_
seeking the truth. When governments possess the authority to define what constitutes 'truth'
or 'misinformation,' dissenting voices are silenced, and those in power are further empowered
to manipulate public perception.

The United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), Article 1, states: “All human
beings are… endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a
spirit of brotherhood.” Article 19 states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”
Together, these Articles highlight the fundamental right to share information and opinions,
and to reach understandings via reason and conscience, making it clear that the responsibility
_to discern truth from falsehood lies with the individual, and not with the State._

Instead of imposing draconian measures that risk suppressing legitimate discourse, Australian
society must foster critical thinking and media literacy to counter misinformation. Existing
legal structures already protect against dangerous speech, such as incitement to violence or
libel. Further restrictions lead down a dangerous path towards an Orwellian 1984-style
dystopia, in company with China, Myanmar and North Korea, where a centralized authority
decides what is 'acceptable' information.

History serves as a stark warning of the dangers of legislation that seeks to ban
'misinformation' and 'disinformation.' From Stalinist purges to modern-day totalitarian
regimes, the suppression of information has resulted in catastrophic consequences for
countless individuals. Instead of stifling free speech, the open exchange of ideas must be
cherished and defended as a fundamental pillar of a democratic society. Instead of allowing
any political authority to define the truth, it must remain the inalienable right of every human
being to seek for themselves what is true. A society built on open debate and truth-seeking is
one that can learn from its mistakes and progress toward a more just and informed future.

The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 should be scrapped outright to maintain a free and open society, to
sanctify the individual right to reason and conscience, and to avoid the potential for disaster
to be brought by any successive Australian government.
