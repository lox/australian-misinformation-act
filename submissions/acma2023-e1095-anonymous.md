The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian people that it distrusts
the public but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is undemocratic and will
prove devastating for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that responsibility
away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its citizens from ideas.
Australians must exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them.

I am extremely concerned about the concept that somebody is qualified to judge what is "misinformation" or "damaging" to the
public on behalf of the public, that they will be pressured by the woke movement, and that these decisions will be biased towards
whatever agenda the elected government is pushing at the time.

This incredibly dangerous "George Orwell" bill should not be given any serious consideration and rejected in the strongest
manner.
