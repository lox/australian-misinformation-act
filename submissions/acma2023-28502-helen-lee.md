Regarding the proposed bill give give new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation:

First of all, this bill clearly goes against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 19: "Everyone
has the right to freedom of opnion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of
frontiers". The few provisions that have been included regarding this are insignificant.

Everyone has the fundamental right to hold and communicate their own ideas and opinions regardless
of whether they are considered "correct" or "approved of" by anyone else, including government bodies.

Moreover, conceivably, there is the potential that ACMA, themselves, are factually incorrect and could
result in censoring true facts. It is dangerous to give such powers to unelected and unaccountable
beauracrats.

The bill has a double standard for the government and the public, excluding government-authorised
content from censorship. Has the government never been wrong on any issue? Instead, this bill paves
the way for the current and future govenments to potential propogandise according to their own
interests, while preventing any opposing views by the anyone who may disagree with them.

This is a dangerous bill and must not go through.
