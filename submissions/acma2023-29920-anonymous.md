In response to the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, I would like to raise my
concerns over the potential misuse, overuse and abuse of the Bill intent if passed. Although it is
stated that the Bill will protect freedom of speech and only focus on

I acknowledge that mis/disinformation can be harmful, it would be much better focusing efforts on
educating users of the existence of this rather than putting legislative means in place to force the
removal of content from platforms that does not adhere to the code of conduct. These platforms
already have policies and codes that generally serve their purpose to protect users from harmful
content (although this could arguably be better). Therefore, setting into motion this Bill would only
further stifle open and free expressions of speech and potentially cause the social media platforms
to set overly high standards for fear of being penalised.

In a free democracy, we should have the right to express ourselves with our right to free speech.
Although the intent is not to impact this, there is always the risk that it will (such as the previous
example of overly high standards for fear of being penalised. There is a high risk that content that is
not produced with malicious intent being considered as mis/dis information and this can impact the
exchange of ideas, critical thinking and open discussion that is typical of a democratic society.

Further, the definition of mis/disinformation is open to interpretation. This would suggest that at
some point, someone would have to make a judgement on whether something is true or not, and
whether harm could be caused. As we have seen from recent years, ‘truth’ and ‘fact’ can change
over time (remember when it was a fact that the C19 vaccinations would stop infection and
transmission, which has now been proven not to be the case, with the accepted truth now that it
only prevents severe disease, and often not for long either).

We need to maintain all opportunities for open and free discussion, without the risk of anything
close to ‘censorship’ occurring. There is also the risk of scope creep tightening what is covered by
this proposed Bill and over time more and more control of content being delegated to the ACMA
with little opportunity to object as the mechanism will already be in place.

In summary, I do not support the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, and
believe that the industry, through its existing codes of conduct and conditions of use, is able to selfmanage any harmful content without the need for big-brother type management by the ACMA, nor
large fines that may stifle free and open speech and discussion by placing fear into media platforms
of large fines. Education of the public should be the aim of the government rather than legislation to
foster a culture of free speech, critical thinking and questioning/accountability of authority.
