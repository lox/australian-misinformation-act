# I was appalled to hear of this proposed bill so I took the time to read the actual document, to ensure I understood it. It is worse than I thought it would be - It's dystopian and anxiety inducing, like something out of the McCarthy Era in the United States, when people were hounded and penalized for their opinions. 
 Freedom of speech is precious and Australians are mature enough to make up their own mind about information they read or view on or offline. The existing laws are adequate and the Communications Legislation Amendment is over-reach - it reads like an attempt to police the  population, to ensure that our opinions fall into line with some official standard. 
 It's horrifying and for the first time in my life, I fear the direction that my country is taking and am sad that my children won't enjoy a free youth as I did. Please reconsider this.
