Submission re: The Communications Legislation (Amendment Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

To Whom it may concern

I recently heard about this proposed Bill and I would like to say that I am very much against it. I had
family grow up in Czechoslovakia under communism and they didnâ€™t have free speech. My family
came here to enjoy the freedoms of the western world. I fear that this Bill will erode the freedoms
that we currently enjoy in Australia.

Any type of hate speech that incites people to violence should not be allowed on the internet but I
am strongly against bureaucrats from the ACMA deciding what is misleading or deceptive content. I
think that there are many things that can be subjective. Only having one group of people (eg. Public
servants) decide things would potentially not allow for a good cross section of content on the
internet.
