I am concerned that the alleged fight against “fake news”, “misinformation” and “disinformation” is
a worry for free speech, a cornerstone of western democracy and the Australian way of life.

Increasingly it appears that government use of these words is code for “censorship” to control not
only free speech but also notions of truth and reality. There are those in places of authority who
believe that their definitions, their preferences, their views must override everything else. We have
seen this over the past several years, where ordinary Australians who disagreed with often
arrogantly propounded, now-demonstrably false and inaccurate, claims by politicians, bureaucrats
and media personalities, have been vilified, lost jobs and in some cases their homes and lifestyles,
been forced to accept mandated toxic jabs, forced to wear masks, have suffered illnesses including
mental health problems, have been refused access to services, refused ability to visit hospitals,
attend funerals, cross state borders to return to their homes, etc. This does not even begin to address
the violence we have seen of police attacks against ordinary people expressing their opposition to
governments effectively imprisoning people in their own homes or the complicit mainstream media
refusing to acknowledge the extent of opposition to the false narratives.

It has become blatantly obvious with the forced release of hidden emails and reports that there have
been government, corporate and media cover-ups of the true facts – all of this despite so-called
“fact-checkers” rallying against them and the de-platforming and closing of accounts of anyone
who does not accept the politically-correct narrative. The de-banking of Nigel Farage in the UK for
holding unfashionable views is a wake-up call for us in this country, too.

The current Bill vaguely defines the key concepts of “misinformation”, “disinformation” and
“harm” thereby permitting government ministers and their bureaucratic advisers - not to mention
the so-called fact-checkers who are trained to operate in a politically-mandated manner – to
continue promoting their own brands of disinformation, regardless of the facts. Your own
Information sheets use phrases such as: “multitude of harms from disrupted public health
_responses…” when the reality is that these public health responses have been increasingly shown to_
have been questionable and excessive.

The notion of keeping people 'safe' from misinformation is itself misleading, as speech, even based
on falsehoods, cannot cause real, direct harm.

Who will control the so-called fact-checkers. The draft states that “the ACMA will not have the
_power to request specific content or posts be removed from digital platform services.” It is almost_
guaranteed that these platforms will automatically remove material to ensure there is no doubt of
their compliance. In very recent days we have seen these “fact-checkers” shutting out any posts on
social media sites as “misinformation” that suggest that the Uluru statement is anything more than a
single page – this depite the fact that architects of the statement have, in the past, quite clearly
claimed that the full statement is “18 or 20” pages long. So, either the social media sites are
protecting their own bank billions, as it were, or they are flagrantly interfering in Australian politics
– neither action I find acceptable. This is a government and its lackies censoring dissenting voices.
This is not the democratic society for which, across the world in the past, Australia has been

Furthermore, the behaviours of these platforms to date have not been encouraging in respect of
_“rules… to have systems and processes in place to address misinformation and disinformation that_
_meets a threshold of being likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.” This concept is open, in_
my view, to any amount of massaging to produce a desired outcome that would, in fact, be harmful
to anyone opposing the loudest political, bureaucratic, globalist or media voices.

I strongly urge the abandonment of this Bill in its current form.
