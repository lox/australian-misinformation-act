# All I want to say about this Bill is that I think it is dangerous. 

 If we cannot have public debate with a variety of views in this country then we have joined the Communist country my parents fled from many decades ago. 

 During covid many voices were hushed and blocked because they appeared to be misinformation, now we see that much of that information was correct. For example, we were told that the vaccine would stop transmission. It hasn’t! We were told that there would be no side effects. There are! We were told ivermectin would not work to cure those with covid. It does! And we were told to trust our government. We did! It proved to be false. The information we were ‘allowed’ to hear and watch was false. This is slowly now unravelling.

 How can we be sure that if the Bill goes through that the information we are fed to is factual? Whose truth is it anyway? Who sets the standard? What gives that person or group the credentials to do that? Our truths vary from person to person. Your truth may state that the world is flat, my truth may state that the earth is a sphere.  If we cannot debate publically and share our truths how will we come to an understanding? Your truth is not my truth. Your values and morals may not align themselves with mine, so am I wrong? Or will time prove that I am right? 

 How can we have public debate if only one view is allowed?

 This country has taken a nose dive very quickly. If you pass this Bill you will be making a HUGE mistake. Please reconsider this Bill
