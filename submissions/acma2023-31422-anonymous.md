Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023- submission closes 6/8/23

The ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 is an attack on ‘Freedom of Speech’. This Bill
plans include combatting Misinformation and Information through ACMA that applies censoring to
Digital Media Platforms. ACMA powers include ordering Digital Media Platform to regulate their
users expressing and exercising their ‘Free Speech’. The ACMA will have powers to decide and
regulate both Digital Platforms and its users or be faced with fronting the committee. The ACMA
will call them to attend hearings and will then apply outrageous fines. All the Digital platforms
would have to set up its agreements with its users centred around this Bill’s should it be
legislated. This would enable censorship and control of ‘Free Speech’. The Government is using
this Bill in an attempt to exercise more tyrannical powers! This Bill raises concerns for Australians
as it tramples on their rights to form and hold an informed opinion that is different to the
Government Political Narrative which electors did not vote for. How will Australians be able to
defend themselves from tyrannical Government Political Powers? The ACMA committee cannot
reflect the general consensus of the Australia people under the guise ACMA. Australians have
rights as individuals to research and study to formulate ones opinion and that is part of our
personal thought process. This process along with discussion and robust debate forms general
consensus of what is ‘True or False’. This is a principle used scientifically too. We must let this
educative process to continue. Censoring by using arbitrary powers over Digital media platforms
will remove ability for Australians to have reasonable discussion and debate without having to
physically be present. Censoring Digital Media Platforms will further limit Australian citizens ability
to have a fair discussion over Digital Media Media. Smaller Digital Media companies will fold up as
they will not be able to function under the proposed Bill. Local Digital Media Platforms will cease
to exist.

This Bill is suggesting a formation of a ‘Ministry of Truth’. The Bill proposes ACMA to bypass
peoples right deciding what is “True and False’ information. Government will use ACMA to
override minds and intellect as it doesn’t allow us to think and decide for ourselves. It sounds like
ones ability to think for themselves is being silenced through the government Bill. Through the Bill
the Government would be employing coercion and this will have an immeasurable and
overflowing effects for each Australian onwards. Therefore dividing the people. Where is the
Democracy for Australians in this proposed Bill?

This Bill attacks people of Faith who live according to their spiritual convictions. It is their
Freedom Speech that allows them to practice their Faith. Individuals need to do their own
research, employ freedom of though and follow their conscious to live their faith. How would
people of Faith be able to defend their beliefs should this Bill be passed? Religious Digital Media
Platforms are already being de-platformed from their Digital media account for speaking about
their faith and religious convictions.

This Bill is being rushed through without proper consideration and process and appears to target
Digital Media Platforms and its subscribers. It may be viewed as an attack on ‘Free Speech’. As
you go through the exposure Bill it is evident that the government has protected itself from
recourse! The last three years being an example where government have exercised overreach of
its powers. The Mainstream Media (MSM) and Digital Platforms were used to report the
Government Narrative view on COVID. Also any discussion on WHO, UN, World Economic Forum
and refuting the science was removed in during the last 3 years eg YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.
MSM now has started reporting a different opinion with no recourse for the Government giving
misleading information on covid using MSM. But the people who stood up against the narrative
using government documents to support their arguments were de-platformed from their Digital
Media accounts. Medical researcher and scientists community were silenced and persecuted also
de-platformed for disagreeing with the Governments Political Narrative. Doctors are no longer free
to discuss their view and opinion freely on Digital platforms. All because evidence, scientific facts
and research studies did not fit the Government narrative. This bill is highlighting red flags to
those who believe every Australian has the right to Freedom of expression when they disagree
and show protest when the government of the day is not representing the electors but self
interested.

Further more our right are implied in several historical conventions. Even The High court implies
rights to free Political Communication under in The Commonwealth Australian Constitution Act.
But in the exposure draft, section 60, is contradictory by stating the constitution rights remain
intact under the Bill. It clearly states that no government shall impede on political communication.
Therefore Australian Citizens have the right to communicate Political dissent.

Australians need to be able to express and exercise their Universal Human Rights which Australia
help to draft in 1948.

_Universal Human Rights 1948, Article 19_

_“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold_
_opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media_
_and regardless of frontiers.’_

As do the Geneva Convention in which Australia is covenanted into.

While accepting that Misinformation has always presented on Digital Media platforms. The only
way to combat it is for us individually refute it through rigorous debate. As Australian Citizens we
have the right to defend ourselves when persecuted.

The Misinformation and Disinformation 2023 Bill, if passed will diminish Australian Citizens
‘freedom of speech’ and freedom of expression. To pass such a Bill will end democracy. It will
cause endless civil and court matters and confusion in the community. Government will be using
this bill, if passed by furthering its Political agenda on the Australian Citizens as we have seen
happen in this country for the last three years. It will divide Australians even further as they will
become further uninformed as they will lose the ability to think for themselves. This will destroy
our country and further diminish what Australian Citizens have fought for through history
‘Freedom of speech and Freedom of expression’. Losing of ‘Freedom of Speech’ and freedom of
expression will take Australians backwards on both a Domestic and Foreign level. That Australia
will no longer be recognised as being based on basic rights and freedom that apply to all people.
