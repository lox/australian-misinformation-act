Submission:
Bill Combating Misinformation and Disinformation 2023

There are some huge assumptions made in this draft bill which can be interpreted as dangerous
ignorance at best, maybe wilful blindness and at worst a ploy to take away the everyday
Australians’ responsibility to think for themselves.
This bill impinges on our right to free speech and also our right to decide what we think about
what is presented to us.
The fact that there are exemptions within this bill such as all levels of government and the
professional media tells us it is both controlling and ignorant. So this bill assumes that the
government of the day, the media, has never lied and therefore never disseminates mis- or
disinformation. I’m sorry, but what a load of bullshit. That assumption is neither safe nor effective.
If this bill is going ahead then please remove all exemptions then we know it is done in the
people’s interests of safety not the governments interests of control.
Otherwise please don’t enact this bill because it will destroy Australian citizen’s right to free
speech and thought. Authoritarianism is not a good look for Australia. Thank you.
