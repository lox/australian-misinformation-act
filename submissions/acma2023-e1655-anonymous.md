The social media I use is one only. forum and is dominated by far right
activists, some of whom are orchestrated by the NSW Liberal Party branch member, posting as
@ .

The level of disinformation is truly obscene in the political sense. There is absolute hatred for non-LNP views. The
Voice and Global Warming are two key issues where false information is often posted with Sky After Dark, and
other Murdoch-owned media writers, being the principle sources of disinformation.

I am among around a dozen non-right wing posters. We often encounter severe trolling and baiting with right wing
posters referring to any who disagree with their views as “communists”

There are Terms of Use in place and posts may be reported to Moderators, but moderators seem to have strong right
wing bias as well.

I applaud the move to monitor social media. I hope it will result in more fair use of free speech but truly it’s the
sources of disinformation, such as Sky After Dark, that needs holding to truth in their political mis/disinformation. If
this principle source of extreme rhetoric can be held to account, many posters with extreme views will need to rely
on their own intelligence.

Please do not publish my email or name when submissions are made public.

Thank you
