The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 claims to balance freedom of expression with countering mis and disinformation but this is not
the case.

This bill dramatically increases the scope of soft censorship in Australia with its proposed definition
of “harm”.

This definition covers a broad range of topics while remaining vague enough that almost any
information could be blocked in Australia depending on government agendas.

In order to uphold the legislations commitment to freedom of speech it’s essential that the
definition of harm be modified so its scope is no greater than in the Online Safety Act 2021.
