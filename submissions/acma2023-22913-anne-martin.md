The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 poses a threat to our democracy, society and economy. In addition to being
undemocratic it is indeed potentially dangerous for a Body to determine what constitutes
misinformation and disinformation, rather than leaving it to the individual to undertake their own
research in order to form an opinion on any given issue. Restricting access to some information but
allowing access to other information is unacceptable.

The Covid vaccine is a recent example. Those cautious folk who questioned the safety and
effectiveness of the vaccine were accused of spreading misinformation and were silenced when in
fact the government’s original claims that the vaccine would prevent contraction and spread of the
virus have now been proven to be grossly incorrect.

In short, given that over time yesterday’s mis/disinformation can become today’s truth (and vice
versa) individuals (and organisations) must be allowed to express views that do not conform for the
currently ‘approved’ narrative without fear that such view will be suppressed.
