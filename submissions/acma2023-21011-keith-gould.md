# It is with regret that this proposal has seen the light of day in a society where our forebears fought and died for our freedoms and this proposal has the determination to take that away. In a decent society all people should have freedom of expression. It is an inalienable right until one starts to deal with those who wish to control others, this case is a prime example. 

 This proposal does exactly that, it removes the right of ordinary Australians to say what they wish on virtually the only public outlet with easy access available to them. The deception of this proposed legislation is as usual well executed. We are told and addressed like little obedient Socialist Numbers, that our rights are being removed to Protect us, Ms Rowland’s words, “Keep Australians Safe”. What a diabolical farce, what utter deceit. 

 If a totalitarian government such as this takes away our voice, then eventually it will as by design take away our thoughts. All people firmly believe their views are based on facts, logic and reason; however, via this legislation the Government is determined that great Australian’s will submit to their deceptive truth and no other. That is how totalitarians succeed.  My Uncle died defending decency, defending the values that made Australia the envy of the world, defending the most important freedom of all, our right to freely speak our mind, our right not to have that right taken away from us.
