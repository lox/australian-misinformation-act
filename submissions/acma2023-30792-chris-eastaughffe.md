Informa�on control in the digital age. 14/08/2023

The principle of free speech, permits, within limits, abhorrent statements, lies, and
decep�on; there are legal remedies available should these limits be exceeded.

It is unfortunate that the leading proponent of this form of free speech, as demonstrated
during the Covid pandemic, has been Government, in Australia. They promoted lies, such as
“the vaccine will stop you ge�ng sick”, “the vaccine prevents transmission”, “Ivermec�n is a
horse paste”, “three day lockdowns” etc. They have never admited to, nor apologised for,
these decep�ons, nor decisions based on the response of focus groups, not science.

In Queensland they are s�ll stopping “unvaccinated” nurses working!

We discovered that sta�s�cs have been manipulated, with people who were vaccinated, and
got sick/died being counted as unvaccinated (because the vaccine was only administered in
the week/s prior to their deaths).

We have no inquiry into the Government ac�ons, we have no inquiry into the subsequent
excess deaths, nor the effec�veness of various regimes implemented around the world
(including “do nothing”).

We have seen the level of Government, and Senior public servant, incompetence, and
downright bastadry, demonstrated by the Robodebt disaster. We have seen the level of
Government failure to hold big business to account demonstrated by the Banking Royal
Commission, and the PwC corrup�on; imagine if bankers, and corporate big wigs, actually
got sent to prison for their crimes, like the litle people!

Imagine Australia having a real treason laws, rather than the current situa�on where you
need 4 impeccable witnesses, and a confession, to even consider doing “something”, and
even then there is the ‘party’ to consider; that is an ac�on the Government could push,
which would address the real threat to Australia (from poli�cians, former poli�cians, and
senior public servants), but they would rather push more control of the ‘litle people’ like
this piece of horse raddish.

And yet, these same poli�cians seek the right to control the narra�ve, to prevent anyone
daring to speak against the Government declared “truth”. Do these poli�cians understand
that George Orwell wrote the book 1984 as a warning, not a “how to” instruc�on manual?
Australia does not need “thought Police”, it does need an effec�ve ASIO unit, Defence Unit,
for dealing with foreign intrusions, and psychological opera�ons.

What is proposed is not that. It is another atack on the freedom of normal Australians. We
are already under threat, unable to debate truthfully, things rela�ng to a person’s claimed
Aboriginality, as more ‘discover’ their Aboriginal Heritage (Racial Discrimina�on Act 1975
18C, 18D), for fear of offending, or insul�ng, someone (another one way street, because it is
OK to offend or insult, the other way).

The Australian people have learnt to NOT trust the inten�ons, the capacity to “do the right
thing”, of the poli�cal class, and Senior public servants, in this country; the most feared
words remain, “I’m from the Government, I’m here to help.”

The Australian poli�cians, the public servants, have to earn back the right to have people
listen to them; the idea that they can use the whip, to control the narra�ve, is a greater
threat to stability, and peace, than their poor ability to provide good governance. Poli�cians
would rather than worship at the feet of their par�es policies, than at the feet of the public
they are meant to ‘serve’. Poli�cians are swayed by vo�ng bases, by loud protest groups, and
display a lack of contact with reality.

We CANNOT afford to have such people have such control over us, over communica�ons, to
be able to block the inconvenient truth. Requiring service providers to retain, and provide,
the details of dissidents, dissenters, is a further dangerous step towards a totalitarian
society. Allowing Government to determine what is misinforma�on, and disinforma�on, is a
greater risk to our society, democracy, and possibly economy (in the sense that the true
picture can be hidden), than online posts.

Why would you let a failed system, of people have demonstrated their failure to be
trustworthy, a system that cannot fix itself, be granted further control over the community;
first demonstrate that poli�cians, and public servants, can tell the truth, and differen�ate
between the truth, and the story they want to put out, before seeking to control the public’s
ability to research, and discuss, what may be the real truth of a mater.

The idea of effec�ve Government is not ‘doing something’, being seen to ‘do something’, it is
actually progressing the rights, the living condi�ons, the economic condi�ons of the people
(just a note, this means all the people, not just select groups), the country; this does none of
those things, it is simply another �ck on the party agenda, a public servants pipedream,
which they will implement, and then get themselves a promo�on based on their effec�ve
implementa�on of a new piece of legisla�on.

If you wanted simple, and effec�ve, all you needed to do was to ensure that a warning, that
“The Australian Government warns this informa�on should not be relied on”, where you
believe the informa�on is suspect, is added at the end. Let people decided for themselves;
any more is draconian.

I did not add references, as intelligent people can look up the informa�on, themselves, FOR
NOW.
