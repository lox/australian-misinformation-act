To Whom it May Concern,


I do not consent to this bill being introduced, and believe it is sadly a gross invasion of our


privacy, and fundamental human rights and freedom of speech and expression.


In any democracy, debates are healthy and we need to have the ability to debate contentious


subjects or issues. We need everyone’s point of view and should maintain some decency and


integrity. There are countless examples of medical beliefs that were long held, and proven


wrong with history. Without the ability to expose the wrongs and debate things safely, it will


be a living hell for people to live under draconian threats, coercion, and ill informed


government or medical misinformation from career public servants who are not even


qualified practicing Doctors or decisions based on incorrect modelling from consultants.


If this is no longer allowed and our opinions are not able to be expressed, then it is now no


longer a democracy. This takes away our rights of “Freedom of Speech”. The government of


the day will then have complete and utter control, which is more in line with dictatorships or


communism. We should be learning from World War II and regimes since, and the many


wrongs that were committed by various governments, and history has shown them to be


wrong.


There are examples in history where Doctors thought wrongly and society proved the beliefs


wrong, examples being The thalidomide catastrophe, lobotomy (Dr Freeman's ‘icepick


lobotomies'), Endometriosis not being recognised (blaming mental state when it was a real


disease that requires surgery); Cigarettes as a cure for asthma; Soothing Syrup was a popular


remedy for babies experiencing anything from teething to diarrhea with a heavy percentage


of alcohol and morphine; Another treatment that was believed to be a cure for asthma was

chloroform. This article claims that one treatment with chloroform completely relieved all

symptoms of asthma. This belief would eventually result in the deaths of patients who had

overdosed during an asthma attack. Many believed that allergy symptoms caused by pollen


(also known as hay fever) could be alleviated with the application of cocaine, as described in


this article here. This was discovered to not be the case. Dr. George Frederick Laidlaw (a


recognized leading pathologist of the homeopathic school in New York) is quoted in multiple

articles saying, “If you can’t cure it without cocaine, you’d better keep the hay fever.

Tobacco smoke enemas were considered a successful treatment for cholera and were


recommended as an alternative remedy to opium. The exact procedure varied, and in some


instances a pint of boiling, tobacco-infused water was administered into the intestines. It was


-----

even reported that “hundreds of lives might have been spared by the tobacco enema.” The


Vioxx scandal- Vioxx was a painkiller approved for use by the FDA in 1999; it led to the


death of 60,000 people in the US; War on dietary fat - In a recent about-face on fat, the US


dietary guidelines advisory committee has removed its previous recommendations against fat


and cholesterol consumption in its most recent report. Electric Shock Treatments were


common for variety of illnesses, but history has proven it to be barbaric and ill informed.


For many years, the tobacco companies pushed their product and it was supported by doctors.

Now we have warnings that smoking can indeed cause cancer. Hence if the tobacco company


had decided to pay enough money a few years ago to a “misinformation and disinformation


committee” for approval, then that warning would never have been made public. A


committee did not exist then however it highlights that we should not be giving power such


as this to a committee. Healthy debates must continue.


When life-saving practices are rejected


Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian obstetrician who theorised in 1850 that physicians


transferred perpeural disease — known as childbed fever — to women in the maternity ward


due to the common practice of doctors at the hospital delivering babies after conducting


barehanded autopsies on diseased corpses. He came to that conclusion after observing a high


rate of deaths in the hospital maternity ward in comparison with the low death rates at the


clinic where babies were delivered by midwives. Semmelweis went on to implement a


handwashing protocol in the maternity ward, which proved successful. It resulted in death


rates declining from 18 percent to 2.2 percent.


What about the COVID vaccines. Data is showing the vaccines have injured and killed more

people than all other vaccines in history put together. Open debate and investigation must be


allowed, to suppress valuable data could lead to catastrophic results. We have already seen


how poor the main stream media was recently with the Covid debacle. The media may have


obeyed the various groups to continue to receive their advertising revenue. Many opinions

about the pandemic were squashed in the early days of the pandemic. The government and

medical companies told us that mass vaccination would stop the virus. This proved to be

totally incorrect and in retrospect to be misinformation. The vaccination did not stop the


pandemic as it did not stop transmission and it did not stop people from acquiring the virus. It


failed. The adverse reports continue to increase. People were harmed and some lost their

lives. The vaccine was far from safe and long term effects will be seen in years to come.


-----

It seems that certain groups of people will be excluded from censorship under the bill. The


ACMA or any organization should not be the decider/arbiter of what is mis or dis

information. The answer to scientific or political controversies is more debate not more


censorship. I oppose law which can be used to increase censorship of potential minority or


fringe voices (which history often shows to have been right). More decisions need to go


through a referendum process.


Hence in concluding, I value “Democracy and Freedom of Speech and basic human rights”. I


do not consent to the ACMA Misinformation and Disinformation Bill being introduced which


will silence everyone, including professionals who have a right to express their findings.
