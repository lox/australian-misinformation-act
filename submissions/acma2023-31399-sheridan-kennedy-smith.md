# Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023

(Combatting Misinformation and Dis-information)

Submission Statement

One would have to wonder at the ‘why now’ of this proposed legislation. Would it have anything to
do with the fact that a fair portion of Australian citizens have not bought into a narrative? The ‘so
called’ truth surrounding the forced persuasions that took place on a daily basis for 3 years where
government colluded with legacy media to place fear and threat amongst it’s own people in order to
make them comply with government imposed directions and the uptake of an experimental drug for
a cold virus? Is the government so panicked by the thought that they cannot control the minds and
actions of those free thinkers that they must resort to silencing those who have a logical, sensible,
yet differing opinion to their own?

In my opinion it is not solely about the Australian government, they have been dictated to and
coerced by a far bigger game at play. Their strings are being pulled by the likes of the UN, WHO, WEF
and GAVI. Our government believes that it has to play ball with these alliances in order to survive on
the world stage, it appears that it is these organisations that dictate what ‘truth’ will be accepted and
what is deemed mis or dis-information. This is obviously bigger than our own government, NZ and
Canada are collectively invested in this same legislation. There are many questionable, worldwide
challenges confronting our humanity that we are expected to buy into and accept as being for the
greater good. A select group of our politicians have gone through the WEF young leaders
programme, they filter through on a national level what the ‘truth’ is decided by the elites in this
organisation. There are agendas at play that we are expected to buy into, that we are told are based
on evidence and reality - inclusionary wellbeing purposes, health strategies, security details, and
saving the planet, namely:

Global Warming/Climate Change, Renewable Energies, Electric Vehicles, Replacing animal food with
bugs, MRNA technology for humans, animals and plants, LGBTQ+ inclusion yet the cancellation of
rights and opinions of the meagre man or woman, Cultural and Heritage Law that stops a landowner
from digging on his or her own land, Smart Cities, The proposed IHR (international health
regulations) amendments and WHO pandemic treaty, Central Banking Digital Currency, Digital
Identity, Vaccination Passports, the list goes on…

Whose truth are we supposed to believe or buy into with these issues when there are so many
variables and data manipulated agendas used to suit a narrative? It’s follow the governments
narrative and be done with it, with no allowance for questions or debate, those that do are
completely and irrevocably dismissed as trouble makers and conspiracy theorists, anyone who
opposes their view is subject to cancel culture. There is no room for discussion on truth. Why is there
a fear surrounding different sources of information? If you believe main stream media then you will
watch main stream media so another source should have any influence or effect on you. We are not
robots that you can programme (yet), we are humans who have the power to think for ourselves and
determine our own opinions, truth determination and management by ACMA is an insult to our
intelligence as a race. Interestingly, as I understand, anyone government or legacy media appears to
be exempt from this scrutiny, correct me if I’m wrong.

Getting back to Covid-19 and mentioning mis and dis-information in the same sentence has been the
governments stumbling block, they see the unravelling of their strategy becoming more evident by

the day. Their daily mantra for almost 3 years - Get pcr tested (a measure that was never intended
for this purpose and proved to give false positives resulting in inflated case numbers) Wear a mask to
stop transmission (completely debunked by experts) Safe and effective vaccinations (declared to be
in a trial period until 2023 – there was no evidence whatsoever of them being either safe or
effective) From the beginning the critical thinkers amongst us didn’t buy into the fear mongering
every single news hour, had the tenacity and integrity to do their own research and seek out
alternative factual expert opinion and advice. It was a cold, a virus and yet our own GP’s were
forbidden to prescribe any form of cure or assistance apart from an experimental, never been used
on humans before vaccine! So where has the mis and dis-information actually come from?

If this legislation is passed and implemented, we edge closer to the end of our democratic right to
free speech. It will not end with the scrutiny of digital platforms it will be the segway to censoring
every platform available to those who dare to voice an opposing view to the government or
whichever other entity is enlisted as a control measure in the future. This is just another step in the
direction of instilling a communistic, totalitarian regime. I’m not sure how the Australian government
thinks going along with this farce is going to benefit them in any shape or form when they no longer
have any say or control once they have sold themselves and the rest of us to a one world
government - the masterplan all along – for the greater good of course, own nothing and you will be
happy!

On an end note isn’t it interesting that there is a monetary penalty attached to this legislation, not
just a warning, not just removal of content but a hit to the pocket – well I guess they need to reduce
the ever inflating over expenditure from the pandemic and net zero buy in any way they can, yes it
makes perfect sense after all.

It is a resounding NO from me.
