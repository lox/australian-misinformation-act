I write to register my objecfion to the federal government’s proposed Communicafions Legislafion
Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023. This bill will erode
democracy in all its forms, and is parficularly sinister because it won’t apply to certain groups and the
government. How convenient.

I wholeheartedly object to Big Tech, governments, ACMA and other bureaucrats (or anyone else)
stepping in to ensure censorship of my reading material “for my own good.” I am perfectly capable of
reading widely, researching and forming my own opinion. Part of being able to do this is to have
independent media sources available at my fingerfips.

Neither the mainstream media nor the government can be relied on to provide an independent
voice. The last few years of COVID hysteria and nonsense demonstrates that perfectly. We were
subjected to relentless propaganda (and sfill are). Most things that the government and the media
said were ‘incorrect’ actually turned out to be true. The same problem has applied in the case of the
‘No’ campaign for the proposed voice to parliament. Why were videos and informafion produced by
the Insfitute of Public Affairs, for example, blocked? And how about the established arrangement
between the Department of Home Affairs and social media companies in Australia over the last few
years – and yet this scandalous and outrageous arrangement has received very liftle coverage in the
mainstream media.

I am well aware of what happens to people’s liberfies in the name of ‘hate speech.’ For some years
now, I have been following the work of Toby Young and the UK’s Free Speech Union. I have seen that
‘hate speech’ is a phrase used by woke censors to silence opinions that they don’t like.

The other danger is the possible re-categorisafion of informafion sources that the government
doesn’t like. For example, what happens if a mainstream outlet (eg. Outsiders on Sky News Channel)
starts reporfing about something that the government doesn’t agree with? What’s the bet that that
outlet would just suddenly be re-categorised as “non mainstream media” and then blocked and
cancelled.

Why don’t you like the fact that we can read a wide variety of informafion these days? What are you
so scared of us finding out?

Governments, Big Tech and unelected bureaucrats should never have the right to be arbiters of truth.
Informafion is proven to be correct or not by bringing it out into the open and debafing it, not by
suppressing it.

I refuse to be told what I can and can’t research or think. Take your proposed Communicafions
Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023 bill and throw it
off the nearest cliff. We don’t want it – it has no place in a democrafic country.
