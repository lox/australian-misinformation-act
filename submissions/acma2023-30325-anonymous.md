# I write to express my extreme concern at the the Communication Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, I believe this bill is a direct contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory.

 To allow our Government and media to be the one source of truth will create a dystopian nightmare.

 To date it is the Government and legacy media who have filled our TV screens relentlessly with propaganda, misinformation and disinformation. Those with an opposing view have been silenced and gas lighted. Medical experts, researchers and everyday people wanting to make an informed choice about their health have borne a financial and emotional cost including isolation and job losses.  Shutting down debate is what got us into this mess. The evidence is out there for all to see what the government and legacy media screamed were conspiracies have to date proven to be factually correct.

 This Bill would see the erosion of the rights of the individual and in doing so create an authoritative governing body with powers that will reach into every aspect of individual and collective life, it will create a totalitarian government.
