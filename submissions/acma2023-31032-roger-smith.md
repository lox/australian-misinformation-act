Submission regarding the proposed new ACMA powers to combat

misinformation and disinformation

_“Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of_
_Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”_

That statement is, in itself, misinformation and disinformation, from any
normal thinking person’s perspective. And there by is the problem. Who will
decide what is misinformation or disinformation, truth or lie, a right or wrong
opinion.

It is this proposed legislation which ‘...pose(s) a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.’

You or nobody in the employ of the government is qualified or has the right to
decide what I can or cannot read based on it’s position to the latest
government narrative or your beliefs.

It is my right to get information from whatever source I choose, research data
and make decisions based on my findings.

You have no right to decide what I can or cannot think, read or on what I am
allowed to base my decisions.

I note the government is immune from the provisions of this intended
legislation, which ironic given the current government and, certainly, the
previous government were the primary source of misinformation,
disinformation and outright lies. This has been proven over and over again.

This legislation is an affront to any concept of freedom of speech or
expression.

It is Stalinist, authoritarian and an insult to the Australian people.

Australian Governments have already been caught out numerous times
weaponising social media platforms to restrict the freedom of speech and
expression of the Australian people. This proposed legislation is just another
attack by government on what still passes for democracy in Australia.

The Covid debacle showed the government lied. Actual scientific information
and the truth were censored. People supporting that information and truth
were vilified and prosecuted. The real purveyors of lies and deceit were the
governments and their ‘experts’.

Masks don’t work and can be hazardous to health if used incorrectly.
Suggested mortality figures were fake, and were very quickly proven to have
been fake. ‘Case numbers’ used to bring in draconian laws, were also faked,

based on tests which could not be relied upon in any way. Shots touted as
vaccines were not vaccines. The shots given were not safe or effective in any
way. All this has been proven as scientific fact over and over again. We know
the truth yet it was suppressed and censored.

No doubt you will receive numerous submissions outlining Australia’s
contravention of numerous laws, treaties and, international conventions and
agreements if this legislation is passed. It is true, Australia will be in
contravention of those things.

But, my main concern is that the covenant between the Australian people and
governments will be fractured irreparably.

Already severely damaged by the actions of State and Federal governments
during the Covid scam; this legislation will destroy any trust left.

Any governments, and certainly no petty public servant, is the arbiter of truth.
You can advise, and even put out you own information. But you do not have
the right to censor anything with which you disagree.

It is an utter disgrace that any Australian government would even propose
such legislation. It is an indication of the contempt and derision governments
hold for the Australian people. Obviously you believe we are too stupid to
make our own decisions based on our own unfettered research.

Not only should this legislation not continue, it should be forever banned.
Those politicians putting it forward should resign in shame and disgrace, as
should any public servant supporting it.

Kind Regards

Roger Smith JP(Q), BA(PS), MIR.
