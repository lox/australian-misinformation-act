### SUBMISSION

 Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023 (“the Bill”)

Far reaching in its implication, for the reasons I set out below, though time constraints limit a more
thorough analysis, I oppose this Bill, or any legislation that may be formulated to replace it. There is
nothing that will rescue legislation created on a flawed foundation with such wide implications.

Commonly fostered as benevolent, once rights are removed, they are extremely difficult to reinstate,
yet easy to extend. Fortunately, we still live in a democracy that permits me to tell this cautionary tale.

This Bill extends a policy of secrecy amid policing proclaimed online “misinformation” and
“disinformation”. With its graduated set of powers to penalise, this Bill poses a threat to the rights of
free expression, self-determination, freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

The proposed legislation obliges a government appointed agency to police certain users of the
internet, pursued with the aim of imposing penalties in the event of communications the government
doesn’t like, while excusing government and elect press from the same legal standards. Consequently,
avoiding for government the cost implications of contesting a decision in court but not anyone else,
while the government has greater financial means to pursue legal action.

The Bill explicitly excludes: “content authorised by an Australian Federal, State, Territory or Local
_Government” (page 29_ Guidance Note); “Content authorised by the government of the Commonwealth, a
_State, a Territory or a local government area will be exempt from the powers. For example, this could be_
_social media post” (page 13_ Guidance Note). Consequently, any information in any communication
disseminated after it has been authorised by the government at any government level even if it is false,
deceptive, or misleading, avoids punishment.

Those pursuing illegitimate rule or totalitarian control are able to do so by the manipulation of public
opinion, made much easier with the regulation of information and its exchange. Begging the question:
Is the proposed legislation aimed to protect Australians or enforce government policy and rule?

The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) is the agency appointed by government
that will create and enforce new industry standards for digital platforms, creating a monopoly over the
communication of information deemed appropriate for the public’s consumption. While requirements
to register users opens participants and whomsoever they communicate with to legalized surveillance.

Choice of digital platforms available under a voluntary participatory regimen is preferable to the
proposed complete scrutiny by Big Brother, still affording the means to those who desire guidance.

The Bill facilitates the scrutiny and censorship of information not just pertaining to the touted issues
of public health (bearing in mind the mass censorship of contrary analysis relating to Covid-19 from qualified
and relevantly experienced professionals) but also foreign policy and by extension opinions from political
parties. There would have been no revealing of lies about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction
(e.g., Chilcot Report). Devoid of open debate, the escalation of unsupportable wars not of our choosing.

While asserted to not apply to individuals, it will impact all Australians by enforcing a regimen
suppressing speech on social media and digital platforms that undermines current (inherently
changeable) government claims.

Enacting legislation allows for amendment and extension, potentially without public input or prior
knowledge and to include anyone in its scope of reach (not merely digital platform providers), whatever
current promises may be made to contain its’ impact.

**Freedom of Speech**

The objective of the Bill is to turn opinion, even speculation, into punishable misinformation and
disinformation. Thereby, enabling control of the narrative by a few regarding a potentially everexpanding or changing preferenced target of communications and without Australians having access
to information for the purpose of determining if it is appropriate or not.

Since when has it been criminal to express or communicate what may be considered minority opinion?

Government is correct to associate information with “harm,” but not for the reasons given.

The ability to express ourselves through language and share information and ideas differentiates us in
the animal kingdom. Once you initiate its removal where will that lead us? Behind the sheep in front?

You cannot be made safer by supressing communication. It is a potent force in exposing untruths,
correcting lies, and combating injustice. Where information is guarded and sanitised the government
becomes protected from challenge or criticism. Consequently, the real power of information lies in its
effectiveness in holding those in authority accountable, with the ability to depose illegitimate regimes.

This bill is leading us down a precarious and costly path in its attempt to: “force social media platforms
_to censor “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is “harmful””. These are all vague terms: - open_
to broad interpretation (and misinterpretation!) and problematic to causally connect (to harm).

The very concept of defining misinformation and disinformation is an impossibility, not to mention
impractical. Any attempt to establish it in a system of punitive reprisal is an encroachment on
democracy (if not the downfall of one) and free speech, the most basic of human rights and desires.

There are extremely rare circumstances where we are obliged to give our life or liberty for another or
the collective, unless we choose to. To initiate the end of unfettered communications between the
citizenry of a country is contrary to what embodies and enables a free society and what Australians
have flaunted and fought for. It is a slippery slope to totalitarianism.

The intention of this proposed legislation is to extinguish individual responsibility, in effect to dumb us
down and steer us to a predetermined conclusion, like lambs to slaughter.

What is initially heralded and penalised as misinformation, provides the means to remove informed
consent and subsequently becomes the basis for involuntary decision making over our very person,
including invasive experimental medical procedures void of informed consent, abhorred on previous
occasions (Nuremburg comes to mind).

There will be no way of determining for oneself if the dictates ensuing are based on what is factually
correct or in our interests. The Bill’s success evident by a sought after total isolating consensus, not
from the perpetuation of truth, rather out of fear of reprisal.

It will be impossible to inculcate an ever-adaptable mechanism to limit asserted misinformation and
disinformation as those criteria inevitably metamorphize, while leading to more and more asserted
cautionary constraints and repertoire of ever-extending all-encompassing punishable acts (as we all get
used to curbing our communications. Private messaging next? Perhaps we can’t be discerning enough to vote?
which ironically may be true if information and discourse is to be censored under threat of penalty).

Though, even proposing adaptability is contradictory to the premise of the Bill. Misinformation infers
there is truth, yet that truth can change over time?

Scholars have grappled with, and written about, the implications of denying free speech for centuries,
concluding that it is far more dangerous to restrict it. John Stuart Mill is just one many.

It is conceded in the ACMA Report itself (page 49) the importance of protecting freedom of expression:

_“Digital platforms provide a vital avenue for the open exchange of opinion, speech, information, research_
_and debate and conversation as well as creative and other expression across the Australian community._
_Signatories should not be compelled by Governments or other parties to remove content solely on the basis_
_of its alleged falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful.8”_

The Australian Law Reform Commission has this to say:

Free speech is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
**Rights, which our country helped draft. As both governments and social media are capable of**
misinformation, open unfettered discourse can equally expose lies. Attempting to regulate truth in
communications will not protect democracy, it will suppress it.

The free flow of information and ideas informs political debate.

People are more ready to accept decisions that go against them if they in principle can seek to
influence them. Freedom of speech acts as a brake on the abuse of power by public officials. It
facilitates the exposure of errors in the governance and administration of justice of the country.

**R v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex Parte Simms [2002] 2 AC 115, 126 (Lord Steyn).**

Australian law has recognised that free speech on political matters is necessary for our system of
representative government: Freedom of communication in relation to public affairs and political
discussion cannot be confined to communications between elected representatives and candidates for
election on the one hand and the electorate on the other (though it appears our own parliamentary

representatives have already been censored). The efficacy of representative government depends also upon
free communication on such matters between all persons, groups and other bodies in the community.

**Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 139 (Mason CJ). See also Nationwide News v**
**Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1, 74 (Brennan J).**

Beginning with a series of cases in 1992, the **High Court has recognised that freedom of political**
communication is implied in the Australian Constitution. This freedom ‘enables Australians to exercise
a free and informed choice as electors.’ Similar to law in other countries, though our Constitution does
not protect a personal right, rather the freedom acts as a restraint on the exercise of legislative power
by the Commonwealth. Though, it does say something important about retaining such right.

**Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106;**
**Nationwide News v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1;**
**Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520, 570;**

**Hogan v Hinch (2011) 243 CLR 506;**
**Adrienne Stone, ‘The Comparative Constitutional Law of Freedom of Expression’ (University of Melbourne Legal**
**Studies Research Paper 476)**

Bills of rights and human rights statutes protect free speech in the United States, United Kingdom,
Canada and New Zealand. Free speech is also provided for in the Victorian Charter of Human Rights
**and Responsibilities and the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT).**

Along with other democracies, Australians have held themselves out to the world as a shining example
of a free society. Imposition of the prohibitions proposed by this Bill have been admonished when
employed in other societies of the dictatorial kind.

**The ascertainment of “misinformation” and correspondingly “truth”, and consequential partiality**

The proposed legislation may be promoted with the intent of holding only digital platform services to
account but individuals using those systems will be impacted and potentially significantly more by any
expansion of such legislation in the future by implementation, interpretation or legislative
amendment.

The possibility is heralded by the first line under the title “The Issue” on the submission website:

“Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as
_well as to our democracy, society and economy.”_

and within the contents of the commissioned ACMA Report and provisions within the Bill for a
graduated set of powers.

The ACMA Report, however, fails to provide evidentiary support for this proposed restrictive
legislation: the conclusions reached are based on mere assertion and opinion of what comprises
misinformation. This is covered in more detail below, pages 11, 18. Requiring misinformation to be
“verifiably” false, misleading or deceptive in the proposed legislation will not resolve the issue of bias.

What are asserted as categories of “misinformation” for the purposes of the ACMA report, being
devoid of an evidentiary base, indicative of mere opinion, result in circular reasoning and constitute a
significant potential for partiality in the implementation and enforcement of the proposed legislation.

We are not to expect that the referenced “professional news” and “reputable news outlets” in the Bill
will be held to the same standard and suffer the same punitive consequences. What constitutes
“reputable” and “professional” is subjective opinion. Defining professional news content to some
regulatory body or standard is limiting and has its own potential for manipulation and bias.

Opinion is fallible no matter where it originates. Asserting something as misinformation or
disinformation, of itself, does not make it true or elevate it to a position of truth because of who
proclaims it so, most particularly by those holding power or their agents.

Determining what constitutes misinformation tends to be subjective, raising concerns about who is
tasked with deciding same. It is easy to anticipate this authority will come from the political camp and
professionals that currently govern, in itself precipitating bias.

Further, no individual can know everything, what makes just a few more, whether pronounced an
expert or not, think they can know so much about what could potentially be a never-ending parade of
subject matter. Even limiting the Bill’s application to a single or limited subject matter can still lead to
significant inequity and harm, as exampled below. It would also indicate partiality and inequity.

Misinformation is a matter of perspective: there are more than likely at least 2 sides deliberating on
any issue, consequently any asserted arbiter of truth is merely taking a side or choosing a view.
Deeming one view misinformation is indicative of bias. As the free and unfettered exchange of
information has been held (at least until now it seems) necessary to determine “truth”, prohibiting and
penalising information pertaining to an opposing view erodes into that process.

The innate difficulty in determining misinformation, due to the scale of it, is acknowledged in the
report. Yet inferring, given sufficient opportunity, individuals can themselves be discerning as more
information emerges:

“Given the constantly shifting nature of misinformation, difficulties in assessing falsehoods, and
_the challenges in accessing relevant data, it is not possible to quantify the true scale and volume_
_of misinformation in Australia.” (Page 17 ACMA Report)_

-----

That it is even possible to determine misinformation and thus disinformation, is an ambitious claim, as
it denotes that initially there requires a determination of the “facts”. Here lies the crux of the issue.

That the ascertainment of truth is achievable by a single authority, free of bias or conditioning toward
prevailing views, magnifies the dilemma of such an aspiration. The arbiter of fact would need to
possess extraordinary capabilities in the sciences and on a vast array of subjects raised on digital
platforms. For instance, there are different opinions held within the same profession and amongst our
representatives in parliament. It would also be naïve to presume that the only source of correct
information can originate in the government arena.

That it is of such a moral impediment for those proposing this legislation as to require the imposition
of punitive sanctions, though named civil penalties, in an area of such scale and uncertainty, where
only a small number will feasibly be disposed to punishment. Employing a **civil test (balance of**
probabilities) as a determinant for misinformation or disinformation, will make it even easier to
enforce government authority, while the censorship employed removes us further from fact or truth.

Before elevating something from mere opinion to fact (if at all feasible) and before any formal punitive
process is initiated, there is required to have been a determination of what will constitute
misinformation and disinformation. There is no persuasive evidence provided to support what are the
deemed examples of misinformation contained in the ACMA Report or, consequently, what that will
be for the purposes of the proposed legislation (see pages 11, 18 for details).

The determination of truth or fact extends far beyond opinion and traditionally requires a court
process, judge or tribunal of fact to determine in punitive matters. More significant penalties are
indicative of more serious wrongs or crimes and a higher test to determine culpability is applied. The
process is time consuming, the expertise required to properly facilitate justice is expensive. Truth is
not found through expedience or deeming via legislation, which merely reduces costs by limiting time
spent on an inquiry into fact finding.

Undeserved punitive action is itself a form of significant harm, of the kind the Bill purports to spurn.

I participated in the court and legal system for more than 40 years, over 20 years as a lawyer. I have
also witnessed proposed and, on occasion, instated incremental theft of our freedom, sold as safety.

I am well aware of what constitutes evidence and how that differs from mere opinion (for which, in the
Justice system, there are rules for the presentation of, where relied upon in evidence) in the establishment of
fact or truth, that is, at least as far as fact or truth can be ascertained with any certainty:

Various tests operate in the law to determine culpability. A “balance of probabilities” is generally employed by
the trier of fact for deemed lesser civil wrongs; stricter liability in some instances such as traffic offences; proof
“beyond reasonable doubt” for each element of a criminal offence. The degree of application may be reduced
even further, in the event a not unusual cost saving expedience route is taken, for instance: reliance upon civil
penalties, which makes fault finding easier due to the lesser standard of proof applied; reversing the
burden/onus of proof to the alleged wrongdoer, which limits the presumption of innocence; limiting the length
of hearing time provided to present your case.

Affording significant consideration where penalties are proposed, and civil rights assailed.

In the Australian legal system, where opinion is in issue, we have an adversarial process during which
opposing expert opinion (for which there usually is) is presented by the participants. In court proceedings
experts from one side of the issue argued will in some instances be permitted to listen to the opinion
of those on the other side, to see where concession may be achieved, inferring there is capable of
being an element of truth in every opinion.

**The right to a fair trial and fair hearing and the application of civil penalties**

The right to a fair trial and fair hearing are protected by article 14(1) of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The right applies to both criminal and civil proceedings.

Though this government guide is neither binding nor conclusive of issues of human rights compatibility, see Guide to
Framing Commonwealth Offences, Infringement Notices and Enforcement Powers, September 2011 edition, available at:
https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/publications/guide-framing-commonwealth-offences-infringement-notices-andenforcement-powers
[https://www.ag.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-03/A%20Guide%20to%20Framing%20Cth%20Offences.pdf](https://www.ag.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-03/A%20Guide%20to%20Framing%20Cth%20Offences.pdf)

Civil penalties are proposed under the Bill. When applying a civil penalty, the individual penalised may
not have been subjected to discovery (though privilege against self-incrimination may be unavailable),
imprisonment, conviction disclosure requirements or the stigma of a criminal conviction, but civil
penalties closely resemble fines and other punishments imposed on criminal offenders, particularly if
there is added compensation orders. In my experience the civil route may lead to greater financial
penalty, particularly when opposing an advocate with potentially unlimited funding.

The process by which civil penalties are imposed is non-criminal, lacking many of the procedural
safeguards built into the criminal process to protect the citizen from arbitrary use of state power, which
becomes an added imperative in the consideration off this Bill, where harm is equally possible (to that
touted to be possible from misinformation) by the censorship this Bill will instigate.

A court dealing with a criminal charge normally has an additional requirement in establishing guilt:
that the defendant had the requisite mens rea, including the intention to cause harm, where that is a
constituent of the offence. In the event this leg of the legal process is thwarted, the potential impact
of the legislation may be manifold. The Bill provides:

7 Misinformation and disinformation
(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is misinformation on the digital

service if:

(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and
(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes; and
(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in Australia; and
(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

In light of the Bill’s potential flawed premise and, consequent, expected implementation, without
having to establish intent to so “cause or contribute to serious harm”, the consequences would be
furthermore unjust and injurious.

In proceedings that employ the civil rules of practice and procedure there is a serious risk of penalties
being wrongly imposed: liability for contravening legislation need only be established on the civil
standard of proof: on a balance of probabilities. In other words, it is easier to establish liability, though
not truth or fact.

Deterrence is not enhanced by punishing the innocent, and in this particular situation acts to reinforce
more censorship and loss of freedoms.

Consequently, claims that legislated civil penalties are necessary “in the public interest” or to prevent
“antisocial behaviour”, again subjective criteria, may do considerably more harm than good.
particularly when legislation is demonstrated to have a false foundational basis that can be applied
discriminately.

**A matter of opinion**

In all the circumstances legislators would want to be certain that communicated opinion in the public
digital arena requires legislative intervention.

There are always opposing or different opinions regarding any subject matter.

Groups, subject to the same environmental influences, may tend to agree more, but isn’t that equally
applicable to those grouped in government organisations? Indicative of the potential for bias in judging
others. For example:

_“the (Chilcot) Report suggests that Government: Had a propensity for ‘groupthink’ – when a group of people_
_conform in their thinking to the extent that their decision-making has an irrational or dysfunctional outcome –_
_reflecting insufficient challenge and a lack of diversity of thought. Didn’t properly understand the situation it_
_was getting involved in.”_
_https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/674545/_
_TheGoodOperation_WEB.PDF_

Concurrently with that expounded above, it is noted: politics foments views and sides; technology is
growing exponentially; science and medicine are not static, nor ever settled. The significant investment
in research conducted in too numerous fields to count is indicative of a never-ending accumulation of
information and, in principle, knowledge. Views alter as research progresses. It takes times, including
decades to be accepted or adopted into mainstream use, meanwhile, in the event legislation is
enacted, punishments may have been levelled.

From thinking outside the box, the greatest discoveries have been made, suggesting that oft the
minority opinion becomes the prevailing view of the day (e.g., the Earth is spherical).

There is also an ethical element involved in the scientific, technological and medical process and its’
implementation that all Australians are entitled to be involved in, particularly when those disciplines
are merging and envisioned to be invasive, potentially affecting our very ability to survive.

In any other era public debate on relevant to the day subject matter would have been an imperative.
Through this Bill, such debate will easily be quashed by an erosion of available information.

As a lack of evidence of causation is not evidence of a lack of causation, there is a necessity to uphold
an individual’s right to inform themselves and share information, particularly where the subject matter
impacts them individually: the more invasive or experimental the more extensive the deliberation.

Further, there is surely an entitlement for any opinion or view formed by an individual to be based on
a different criterion to what others base theirs, such as conscience, religion, culture or one of the
various positions different fields of the sciences take.

It is evident that those countries in the developed world, wherein its citizens participate in the free
exchange of information and ideas, able to pursue unfettered, creative and industrious pursuits, have
become better off materially and mentally (free from fear of reprisal that would be experienced under any
sort of dictatorship).

It is not through governments that new ideas and technology emerge that consequently benefit us all,
it comes from individuals through the creative process. Would it be wise now, when it could be said
we have reached a pinnacle of existence, to dictate what information and the ideas they contain can
be communicated?

8


-----

**It can be easily concluded that:**

(i) Open free discussion and debate is imperative to promote truth, fairness and justice, even
security.

(ii) The sheer impossibility of reaching any so called “truth” for the purpose of informing
“misinformation” (false, misleading, or deceptive) or “disinformation” (the purposefully detrimental
sharing of information) and, by legislative extension, so as to cause harm: “that content is
_reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”._

**Digital Platforms - an erroneous mechanism and aspiration**

It would appear in the condemnation of digital platforms, contrarily, we have handed over decision
making to those very platforms in regard to what constitutes misinformation and raised them to be
trier of fact and ultimate expert on matters of science and medicine (by way of proclaimed “third-party
fact checkers”, an endorsed equivalent it seems to the justice system without the usual accreditation and scrutiny).

Alongside, creating partnership and conflicts of interest, through financial donations, with favoured
news outlets.

“platforms have: invested in third-party fact-checking organisations to proactively identify and flag false
_information on their service….provided financial assistance and grants to news outlets and government and_
_not for-profit organisations to bolster the spread of credible information and news” (page 98 ACMA Report)_

In the alternative it is proposed that government, via its own agents, be both the determinant of truth
and retaliator.

While the proposed legislation would be excluding alternate information and views, it will potentially
be reinforcing, what was once said to be undesirable, a monopoly by large digital platforms alongside
government.

Providing for a regulatory body or similar as overseer: no matter how initially good intentioned and
whether asserted as independent or not, has the potential to become co-opted, corrupted and
ineffective via, amongst other things, revolving doors between industry and the body regulating it.
Recompensed positions of employment alone are sufficient to incur dependency and loyalty from the
payee to the payer (see Appendix for further details).

**Community**

Unfettered community is pivotal to the enjoyment of personal freedoms on which democracy, as we
know and appreciate, rests. Digital platforms and social media are modern town squares and where
there can be expected the expression of a variety of opinions.

Precipitously, after many generations, communications between citizens are being considered a bad
thing and require significant penalties to curb opinions contradicting reigning government attitudes?

The internet is relied upon by professionals and individuals alike for research and exploration. For
many: an opportunity to express feelings and concerns, which subject matter could now be elevated
to punishable misinformation.

9


-----

Do we currently ensure that in every sentence spoken with friends and work colleagues they contain
only fact or truth (someone’s “truth”)? A rather onerous task I would suggest, though, one we may very
well have to look forward to.

The digital platform is community for people. This is acknowledged in the U.S. Supreme Court case
**_Packingham v. North Carolina decided 19 June, 2017: social media platforms are the “modern public_**
_[square”.   https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf)_

In an era of promoted pandemics, enforced lockdowns and restrictions, digital community can be
anticipated to be relied upon even more. Where will it lead if there is only the mundane to consider
and explore or we are too afraid to do so during such crises?

Misinformation (in other words, sections of society holding differing opinions and stances) is par for the course in
any democracy upholding its’ freedoms. While it has existed, we have managed to survive and provide
ourselves with a comparatively rich, safe and industrious life (depending upon how the individual chooses
to approach it and subject to the information they avail themselves of).

Is a punitive regimen being legitimised merely because our community is larger now and seen as less
manageable? I don’t anticipate that restricting freedoms will make it more so.

**Premise for and impact of the Bill: demonstrated bias and placing the Bill in context.**

It is evident that the implementation of this proposed stifling legislation may cause a decline of society
through lack of stimulus to individual achievement, while detrimental to our health and quality of life.

This is indicated by the **categories of communications purported to be misinformation or**
disinformation in the ACMA Report, revealing the type of subject matter the proposed legislation will
be implemented against. The selected few publicised in the report consist of well-known controversial
subject matter worthy of open discussion and public debate (if individuals actually undertook their own
investigation, they would easily recognise this), definable as: prophylactics (vaccines), communication
systems (5G) and environmental issues (climate).

Labelling and boxing information on such topics into “conspiracy theory” (even though conspiracy crimes
do exist) in an attempt to derogate and isolate it from consumption, further demonstrates bias.

This bill must also be placed in context to determine its potential impact if enacted:

1. Unlike other nations, we do not have in Australia enshrined constitutional or other legal

protections guarding our human rights. This includes freedom of speech. Limiting our ability
to challenge incursions.

2. Concerns being raised amongst academics in regard to the editing and censorship of formerly

accepted, even revered, literature, tantamount to proverbial book burning. When perhaps
such literature, not conforming to any “woke” agenda, should remain as a reminder in the
setting it was written.

3. The data for the ACMA Report informing the Bill was obtained during a time when many

Australians were put in fear over a declared asserted novel harmful pathogen and,
consequently, unknowable, even to governments. Yet apparently necessitating restrictions,
lockdowns and isolation, when imposed in other circumstances are known to have
psychological impact and could have influenced the opinions given at the time (e.g., acceptance
of what was possibly proposed to them as being misinformation, though there is a lack of specificity in
this regard) and the outcome of ACMA’s report.

4. Initiation of controls tantamount to mandating (dictating) an invasive medical procedure to

enable an individual to earn a living and support a family during 2021 and 2022. Previous
conditional legislation such as: ‘No Jab No Pay’ and ‘No Jab No Play’. Where a perceived rather
than proven potential for harm qualifies for the implementation of policy or legislation that
impacts our bodies and income.

5. There is a presumption in today’s societies that harm does not exist until proven otherwise,

though, which harm may take considerable time to be recognized, that is, if there are the
financial resources available to pursue validity for same and concerns raised are not ignored.

6. A climate of righteous expedience, cost saving, but contrary to ensuring justice.

7. Public private partnerships (Government and private enterprises together influencing or dictating all
encompassing global policy. Though such private enterprises are oft touted as philanthropic, benefit
financially).

8. We are advancing through a digital age, which if completely incorporated into society as

touted, its’ citizens captured (such as via limiting or eliminating cash, digital I.D.’s, facial recognition
and CBDC’s), enables the means to absolute surveillance and control.

9. That government is becoming ever increasingly reliant upon secrecy, while it is the opposite

for countries’ citizens, whose lives are more and more scrutinized. While online activities have
granted social engineers an all-seeing predictive eye with which to program us. What will
prevent deemed misinformation and disinformation falling under such purview? On this point:

The Australian government is currently undertaking a review of secrecy provisions across Commonwealth laws to
address concerns raised by multiple reviews about the number, inconsistency, appropriateness, and complexity of
Commonwealth secrecy offences, while it is reported that in one year, tech giant Google received over 6,300 requests
from Australian authorities to disclose user data. In this regard, by way of example, I refer you to:

**ACMA will be charged under the Bill with determining what information Australians can and can’t see**
on digital platforms. How this will impact other means of communication in the future we are yet to
see. The target is “misinformation”: information that is “false, misleading or deceptive” and
“reasonably likely to cause or contributed to serious harm”.

As a consequence of the material provided in support of the proposed law, we are alerted as to what
will constitute misinformation or disinformation (to what further degree would be a lesson to come).

The digital platform rules may require a digital platform provider to register and retain records relating
to such information. Considering the preconceived beliefs by authorities as to the type of content that
constitutes misinformation and its’ asserted capability for harm, there is no comfort afforded by any
claims of privacy when government or its agents has access to punishable information.

11


-----

Identified in the ACMA Report is **controversial subject matter consistently discussed among**
professionals and the public (at least to anyone more widely read and not merely parroting current policy
directives) pertaining to: 5G, climate, public policy and vaccination, all currently under government
domain and, consequently, requiring the free flow of information imperative for representative
government. The areas touted as misinformation also rife with potential financial and other conflicts
of interests.

**In brief: vaccines do cause harm and death; this is reflected in around 19 other countries having no-**
fault compensation schemes for those injured by them. This includes the country where vaccines are
produced, the U.S.A, and are considered unavoidably unsafe: Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. 223
_(2011).  I refer you to the U.S. legislation: The_ _National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Most_
countries, including Australia, have adverse events reporting systems, albeit (though expediently)
passive ones.

Our government acknowledges that “adverse events are under-reported around the world, with
_[estimates that 90-95% of adverse events are not reported to regulators.[1]”](https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/new-web-service-helps-consumer-reporting-side-effects#one)_

https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/new-web-service-helps-consumer-reporting-side-effects

As a lawyer having practised in this area, I am quite aware of the controversy surrounding vaccination
and familiar with the many highly qualified professionals, researchers and scientists around the world
who hold differences of opinion to that currently informing public policy. Numerous professionals
continue to speak out, including those who have been involved in the pharmaceutical industry and
vaccine manufacture. Existing media censorship has limited access to this information. While mere
opinion (from organizations like GAVI, a public and private partnership, moved by medically unqualified financial
donors, who themselves stand to gain by the sale of vaccine products to the world) has been promoted.

Government appointed experts do not have a monopoly on opinion, nor should they, as Government
is the only authority that can by rule of law quelch freedom.

Where authority is unable to demonstrate an ability to distinguish between opinion and fact, they or
their appointed agents should not the barometer for misinformation.

It would be impossible to provide here a comprehensive analysis on subjects raised as misinformation
in the ACMA Report. Consequently, it should not be left to one agency to do this. The Appendix that
follows provides examples of the types of information that could easily be labelled misinformation in
the event the Bill is passed, including a revealing examination of recorded Commonwealth and State
government statistics and reports, appearing in the literature prior and subsequent to mass covid
vaccination (following which significantly more harm is statistically observed, conveniently blamed on variants,
while Australians were coerced into having vaccines that didn’t prevent the asserted disease or harm – whether
the consequence of a new disease or the new vaccines employed to protect us from it).

By this legislation it is not proposed to merely reinforce the current framework, rather extend it, and
add significant penalties. Once treading this path there is likely no containing it. Which means that
there will be no alternate platform remaining to explore subject matter, unlike there currently is.
Maybe not even to explore the impact of the Bill, if enacted.

It will be tantamount to having a programmed entity, like ChatGPT, the source of and response to all
enquiry: we put the question, a programmed entity answers it. We have no measure with which to
ascertain the accuracy of what has been elicited. Neither will we have information about its
programming.

**The alternative to restrictive legislation**

By exclusion you misinform. By inclusion you demonstrate openness and transparency, attracting the
authoritative attention evidently desired by government.

Reliance upon digital platforms is equally indicative that people are observant and discerning, see
public policy as exclusionary or dictatorial requiring explanation and exploration. Hence, the benefit
of a participatory process rather than exclusionary which limits decision making to a single authority.

Perhaps rather than bring in further restrictions to our liberties, the government foster a truly
informative role by acknowledging a wide spectrum of recognized professional opinions, together with
evidence supporting their position, and provide the reasoning as to choosing which opinion (it can only
ever be opinion) is to inform public policy, simultaneously addressing concerns raised by those
professionals.

Alongside, truly encourage public participation in any decision-making process that has the potential
to impact on the freedoms we have managed to sustain for more than a century. Rather than what we
saw during the declared pandemic: a reduction in those participating in the decision-making process.
As it is reasonable and sensible in such circumstances to question decisions being made on our behalf
in isolation, particularly about an asserted novel and unfamiliar disease.

**Purported harm requiring legislative solution – a premise of the Bill.**

Harm is identified as:

_“Harm means harms which pose an imminent and serious threat to: A. democratic political and_
_policymaking processes such as voter fraud, voter interference, voting misinformation; or B. public goods_
_such as the protection of citizens' health, protection of marginalised or vulnerable groups, public safety and_
_security or the environment.” (Page 52 ACMA Report)_

The definition of harm in the Bill is highly subjective, encompassing anything deemed hateful,
disruptive, or harmful to various aspects such as society, democracy, environment, and economy.
These terms are open to interpretation and bias. When:

If concerned about information precipitating: violence, property damage, illicit content or other forms
of harm, then there are already laws and measures in place in that regard. While threats, harassment
and vandalism are already punishable when proven under proper evaluation of the evidence pursuant
to law.

It can likewise be argued that similar harms may occur as a consequence of secrecy and by the
elimination of informed choice, which is what freedom of speech sustains.

Some would say that requiring an invasive medical procedure, only provisionally granted, not typically
tested and of a new type, might be considered a form of physical abuse because of its potential to
cause unknown physical harm. And particularly so when under threat of loss of employment or their
business and means to earn a living and support a family. This arguable tenet requires an unfettered
exchange of information.

As a consequence of: (i) the provision of insufficient verification for what is proclaimed misinformation
in the ACMA Report, together with (ii) assertions that it was a matter for the individual whether to be
vaccinated or not, despite threat of unemployment - there is an inference that information necessary
for decision making in regard to bodily integrity may end up excluded by this Bill.

13


-----

Basically, we can expect to be told by paid government professionals what to think and say, due to
censorship of those professional opinions lacking such endorsement and whose evidence will thus be
excluded from digital platforms. Without unhampered discourse on issues of bodily integrity, we can
anticipate the derogation of innate rights in respect to our own bodies. Contrary to the acknowledged
necessity for informed consent provided for in the Australian Immunisation Handbook.

Those people who believe that it is the role of Government to ensure the public is not exposed to
misinformation, as is intimated in the ACMA Report, is not necessarily synonymous with saying
government, or by its agents, should be the sole authority on any subject matter. Those individuals can
go to that authority for their information and disregard any contrary information they happen to come
across. No harm results in the eyes of those favouring the authoritarian approach. The asserted
authority merely needs to guide them there (which has occurred on-line over the past 3 years) should they
have difficulty accessing same.

Alternatively, if you truly find the content of digital platforms and social media detrimental to you or
your family, simply avoid or limit its use. Vote with your feet (or, in this instance, hands).

A basic premise of economics is that demand creates supply. Those business will soon conform to the
wishes of the public when it hits their presence in the digital world and pockets, and without having
to create complex, open to partiality, legislation.

This is how you claim the system you want. Sometimes taking individual responsibility means going
without for a while, though, for something better, as occurred when our predecessor not only went
without, but risked “life and limb” going to war to secure the freedom we have today.

Exposure to risk can in effect safeguard us and our freedom.

It should be borne in mind that there is risk in everything we do: driving a car, using public transport,
air travel, even playing sport. Individuals should have the choice as to whether they want to take what
are perceived to some as risks, similarly in mitigating those risks, particularly when it comes to the
sanctity of our bodies and in how we live our lives.

It should be a matter for digital platforms themselves if they wish to go down any censorship route, I
anticipate they will eventually lose following as the consequence of any lack of true discernment as to
what patrons truly want. Those willing to ‘risk’ viewing (not necessarily endorsing) information on
platforms who refrain from censorship, can then do so. Everyone wins and human rights remain intact.

**Whereas:**

Any declaration that reducing civil rights is for our protection disregards warnings from history and
literature.

Limiting access to information and its exchange by an authoritarian dictatorship of permissible
information, in the face of reprisal:

(i) limits (more than intended due to the fear of crossing the line) the acquisition of knowledge,

understanding and empathy (which we need more of not less to be a truly civilized and proud society),
and,

(ii) particularly when considering the controversial subject matter exampled in the ACMA Report as

representative of misinformation, is an eventual road to: Corporatocracy, totalitarianism and
enslavement.

Is this a safe or equitable position to be in?

14


-----

The inference we can’t be trusted, only government can, suggests that authority cannot be abused,
when government is the only authority capable of eroding rights and privileges.

If information can be powerful, it can be equally if not more powerful in the hands of government,
where there can be limited or no opportunity to correct or challenge an injustice.

If the reporting process and content of the Report informing the legislation is to be kept confidential,
what hope is there for the process of determining misinformation or disinformation, once the Bill is
ensconced in law.

Where it is merely alleged that misinformation and disinformation causes harm, there is historical
evidence that governments of the dictatorial mode can cause significant harm. Isn’t that why we have
promoted our society as democratic and free, while condemning those that are said not to be?

To assert that by not following government claimed authoritative advice, for instance during the recent
declared pandemic, poses an immediate and serious threat to an individual’s health and safety, upon
statistical examination I would suggest that the opposite may be demonstrated (see Appendix).

There could be said to be unnecessary deaths a consequence of the invasion of Iraq due to a flawed
premise by those in authority.

Individuals should understand that democracy with all its benefits does not come as a free ride.
Responsibility lies with each of us, by participating in the process itself, which is recognized, for
example, by this opportunity to make a submission and by being an informed voter. (Would you hand all
your money over to a financial advisor and not check from time to time on their competence and that your money
hasn’t diminished).

This proposed legislation will, contrarily, act to reinforce helplessness and a victim mentality, if not
laziness in Australia’s citizenry.

Introduction of the proposed legislation could polarise Australians rather than bring us together,
turning community into a battlefield of information denunciation (or more particularly, personal
denigration), with the potential for branding and retaliation, something sought to be avoided by the
legislation.

It is hoped by this bill there is no suggestion that individuals lack intellect so as to be incapable of
discernment, which would also lead to the conclusion that similarly would those individuals in
authority establishing codes of conduct the rest are required to adhere to as they too must reply on
others (including specialized) opinion.

While many an historical sage was self-taught, would it not be preferable to truly educate individuals
and so learn how to be judicious? What is the point of long years of education if we are said to be
unable to navigate this world, including new technology and matters of science?

We didn’t learn to ride without the occasional tumble or mishap and overtime with experimentation
and practice we excelled. The same readily applies to exploring information, with guidance rather than
coercion.

Devoid of intellect we are dumbed down ineffectual soldiers marching together, into the future, in rank
and file, dictated to by an Orwellian Ministry of Truth.

In conclusion, the only way to combat misinformation is to publicly refute it, not censor it. By standing
up to scrutiny it automatically becomes authoritative.

**The pursuit of knowledge and understanding, not safety at its expense**

The perceptive and exploratory would like the opportunity and enjoyment of discovery. If in the pursuit
of knowledge and an understanding of our world, perhaps even of truth (in the realization that truth is a
difficult thing to ascertain, opinion often easily substituted for truth), a pursuit undertaken by many since
antiquity (evidenced in disciplines of science, philosophy and literature, which sources I am sure I don’t need to
name).

Scientists, academics and philosophers, not all necessarily schooled, through the ages have provided
us with an immense amount of information on a variety of subjects, yet the differing views and
opinions held have never been said to harm us, rather, to educate us. Except perhaps of the dictatorial
variety. I would suggest the knowledge consequently accumulated over centuries, diverse and ever
evolving as it may be, has enhanced our lives.

The search for knowledge and understanding requires a free flow of information, as well as the sharing
of ideas. Information shared for the most part may be mundane or incorrect but can still facilitate such
aspiration as it enables discernment. Those individuals unfamiliar with these concepts should be the
last sitting in judgment of others as they have likely not ventured on the search for information and
understanding of subject matter sought to be censored.

Expertise is the consequence of experience and acquiring information and knowledge from a wide and
variety of sources, including contrary sources (how else can they be tested and negated). There is no
original authoritative source on any subject matter. How can there be one in determining what is
misinformation.

A confounding factor in determining misinformation is that there are different paradigms of belief and
approaches to life, which an opposing belief system may construe as misinformation.

Some individuals favour a spiritual approach to life, yet even religions have differing views.

In resisting a material perspective of the world, which for the most part science and medicine prefers
(though this is changing for instance because of the study of quantum physics), are those individuals to be
censored and penalised for questioning prevailing authority on a given subject? Such path is equally
likely to lead to “scientism” and missing crucial information in assessing and understanding the world
we live in (the whole aim of science).

As I know many others do, I personally want the freedom of thought, exploration, expression,
communication and to be able to discern for myself what is capable or not of enriching my life.

I want to gain understanding and get as close to the truth as possible (and why wouldn’t we avail ourselves
of such an opportunity in this age, where a variety of information is more accessible than ever before, but those
advancing this legislation wish to throw away). That is why perhaps others with a similar inclination or need
are often called “truthers”, though the term is disparaged in the ACMA Report (conveniently boxed into
conspiracy theory to discourage the uninformed going there). Yet it is contradictory to suggest people
seeking the truth would not endeavour to be discerning.

This legislation, together with the chosen few who will be sitting in judgment, dictating truth for all,
can only stifle the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, merely through threat of punishment
before there is even a chance to test in court what constitutes misinformation, that is, finances and
legal standing permitting (which ordinary Australians are unlikely to have despite the impact the proposed
legislation would have on them).

16


-----

**Lack of specificity: opinion, assumption and circulatory arguments relied upon in support of the Bill.**

There is little transparency afforded in advancing this Bill. Forewarning how the proposed legislation
is to operate?

The ACMA Report is vague in qualifying misinformation: relying upon unsubstantiated opinion,
assumption resulting in circulatory arguments and reasoning in the promotion of the government and
its’ agents as arbiter of misinformation and, correspondingly, “truth”.

The arguments proffered, and illustrations following, establish an improper premise for punitive
legislation:

1. The assumption that, despite some concerns of a relatively small sample group over ordained

misinformation, Australians would, if the full implications were understood, truly concur with
going so far as to implement legislation prohibiting and basically making unlawful the
communication of information and, consequently, conversation between them on digital
platforms. That is: no longer upholding basic freedoms of speech and communication in some
predefined areas decided by government or a government agency, conceivably later to be
extended. Abruptly abandoning democracy for dictatorial principles.

While: 44% of those asked believed “false or misleading information is unavoidable and it is just
_something we must live with”; 25% had no opinion in this regard (page 37); “76% believe platforms_
_should be doing more” to reduce false or misleading misinformation. However, this does not_
necessarily translate to legal prohibitions on free speech and enforceable civil penalties (page 36).

2. Of those 2,659 adult Australians surveyed between 19 December, 2020 and 18 January, 2021 for

the ACMA Report, the specifics of representations made to participants are unclear.

The supposition that the lay public would be able to distinguish opinion from fact and,
consequently, what constitutes misinformation, that is, without being told beforehand (assumably
by the appointed agency enquiring). Even professionals ensconced in their own specialities might be
unaware of the way the opinions regarding misinformation advanced in the survey were
concluded, though content to accept what was declared misinformation for the purpose of the
survey.

3. This is particularly evinced in regard to “covid”: scientists, medical practitioners and those in

authority lacked factual information in early 2020 about an asserted new disease called Covid19 caused by a continually mutating novel virus (when deaths attributed to said virus, purported to
be a relative of the cold virus, were low, and comparable to disappearing flu deaths, that is until mid-2021
after a mass vaccine campaign, see Appendix). Followed subsequently by the provisional grant of
**pioneering vaccines in early 2021.**

The truth not clearly ascertainable at that point in time to anyone. Thus, it could be said that
misinformation relied upon for the questionnaires was based on mere assumption, but it is
proposed that we shouldn’t be allowed to discuss it (what impacts us) on the internet?

4. Though surveys may be considered reflective of the wider community, this is not certain. Put in

context, only 2,659 Australians were surveyed and either during or shortly following a period of
repetitive psychological media fear mongering (that statistics didn’t support; the PCR test an
inappropriate indicator of actual disease impact, see Appendix) and prior to the clear impact observed
by mid-2021 following mass vaccine uptake:

_“This study was undertaken by the News and Media Research Centre (N&MRC) at the University of_
_Canberra. The quantitative component consisted of a nationwide representative survey of_ **_2,659 adult_**
**_Australians, undertaken between 19 December 2020 and 18 January 2021. The qualitative component_**
_consisted of 12 focus groups with a total of 60 participants, undertaken across February and March 2021,_
_with participants recruited based on a mix of demographic characteristics, geographic locations, and media_
_habits.” (Fact Sheet 1)_

_“This study was undertaken by creative consultancy We Are Social. This project sought to examine the scale_
_and drivers of 4 distinct online misinformation narratives in Australia (antivaccine, anti-5G, anti-lockdown_
_and QAnon) over a 12-month period (April 2020 to March 2021). It consisted of an examination of over_
_60,000 public conversations across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, identification and_
_analysis of 291 Australian conspiracy-driven pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram, and a manual_
_review of misinformation narratives on TikTok and Telegram. This research informed the ACMA’s report to_
_government but will not be made public as it contains sensitive information pertaining to public figures and_
_user accounts.” (Fact sheet 1)_

_The ACMA sought cost information for both 2019 and 2020 calendar years from carriers for costs directly_
_related to addressing (or incurred as a direct result of) 5G or electromagnetic energy dis- or misinformation._
_In April 2021, AMTA distributed the final survey on behalf of the ACMA and co-ordinated responses from_
_members. Telstra, Optus, TPG Telecom and AMTA all provided the ACMA with high-level cost inputs,_
_allowing us to estimate the financial impact across the industry.” (Fact sheet 1)_

_“The ACMA’s misinformation report provides an overview of the Australian Code of Practice on_
_Disinformation and Misinformation and an assessment of whether, in our view, it had met the expectations_
_set out by the government as at the end of June 2021” (Fact sheet 2)_

5. It is claimed in support of the Bill that misinformation of the kind documented in the ACMA

Report “pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy,
_society and economy.” The designated “misinformation” and, consequently, pre-determined set_
of “facts” and causal impact lack specificity: there is an absence in the Bill’s supportive material
of any tested convincing evidence to support a contention that the nominated information is
deserving of the label “misinformation” or in what manner it was determined to be
misinformation or cause the purported harm.

Without this specificity of evidence, contending certain subject matter is misinformation takes it
no further than mere opinion. Frustrating any ensuing allegation that the pre-determined
nominated misinformation is cause for concern and a threat to Australians. Consequently, it is
also not a leap to contend that in these circumstances we can’t rely upon the governments
appointed agency to be an independent arbiter of misinformation in the event the Bill is enacted.

6. There is a lack of specificity in the ACMA Report for the generalised claim of 5G misinformation,

suggesting predetermination by the report instigator and author. It is arguable that
communication and discussion about 5G is reasonable when placed in context, though yet again
portrayed as if there was no current debate on the issue, when there has in fact been significant
global debate on the issue among professionals and concerned citizens for some time. 5G has
not been scientifically tested for its long-term impact, rollout commenced globally around the
time the covid pandemic was declared. Though there are varying “5G” systems being introduced.
(See Appendix)

18


-----

7. Besides a lack of specificity of evidence upon why particular information was deemed incorrect,

other than the reporting government agency thinks so, use of terms such as: “authoritative
_source” and “conspiracy theories” “conspiracy-driven” further lack context and specificity of the_
factual evidence relied upon. Specificity is further lacking regarding asserted harms: “acute” and
“chronic”. They are all conclusive terms and, without more, unsubstantiated opinion.

8. The suggestion that providing links to sources of information communicated deemed

“misinformation” is somehow a bad thing and unpersuasive. Yet providing foreign examples of
asserted harm irrelevant to Australia, such as the Capitol Hill riots.

9. While the inference that “small” and “alternative” platforms would not be authoritative. Small is

not inherently bad, geniuses are few, minority views have prevailed over time (the earth is a globe).
It may rather be indicative of only the few who undertake their own research or think for
themselves.

10. The justification given (page 11 ACMA Report) that:

_”the Australian adult population continue to access news on social media on a regular basis. A further 23%_
_of Australians nominated social media as their main source of news – a figure that has been steadily rising_
_each year”_

is equally indicative of Australians being discerning and explained by the somewhat circular
argument:

_“A lack of trust in authoritative sources does, however, appear to be an indicator of whether or not someone_
_believes in COVID-19 misinformation” (page 10 ACMA Report)._

Here we see assumptive pronouncements: “authoritative” (who and by what measure was this
decided?).

11. The assertion that “misinformation narratives can result in a wide range of acute and chronic

_harms, including the erosion of trust in authoritative sources and democratic institutions over time”,_
beside a lack of specificity and an assumptive circulatory argument, suggests again that the fault
may lay with those very asserted authoritative sources.

12. Hence, a lack of trust in proclaimed “authoritative sources” is what is required to be addressed,

not more authoritarianism. Perhaps there are good reasons for this lack of trust. While those
employed by government may be more easily inculcated to accept the narrative of that
institution, others to avoid being labelled “conspiracy theorists”. There are ample highly qualified
professionals expressing different opinions, perhaps they and the evidence supporting what they
have to say should be acknowledged in any decision making:

_“A lack of trust in authoritative sources does, however, appear to be an indicator of whether or_ _not someone_
_believes in COVID-19 misinformation. Those who were ‘misinformed (high)’ about COVID-19 had much_
_lower levels of trust in scientists and health professionals, and much greater trust in generally less reputable_
_health and lifestyle websites and blogs, and news found on social media (Figure 5). This accords with other_
_recent Australian research that shows belief in COVID-19 misinformation is closely associated with lower_
_institutional trust.13”_ (page 11 ACMA Report)

The underlined in this paragraph contains a further example of unsubstantiated opinion and the
absence of specificity.

19


-----

13. The following claim could equally be said to apply to government institutions:

“There are a range of social and cognitive biases that drive people to engage with misinformation, such as
_in-grouping, political fragmentation, and identity-based conflict. Research suggests people may be driven_
_to engage with misinformation on ideological grounds or to defend their worldview, even if they do not_
_believe the content.” (Page 24)_

14. The Bill is in global lockstep, indicative it isn’t necessarily what citizens want, but a global

authoritarian consensus (i.e. potentially having no factual basis, simply agenda):

_“United Nations Communications Response initiative to combat the spread of disinformation and_
_misinformation is launched” (page 103)_

_“The ACP highlighted how an “August 2018 Five Eyes Ministerial gathering on Queensland’s Gold Coast took_
_aim at ‘faster identification and removal of illicit content’ and limiting ‘coercive acts of interference and_
_disinformation’. ”_

[https://citizensparty.org.au/print/pdf/node/1662](https://citizensparty.org.au/print/pdf/node/1662)

15. The acceptance that the determinant for truth has been left, and will continue to be left, to digital

and social media platforms, when there is a lack of specificity as to the process and evidence
relied upon by them for concluding truth and hence misinformation (though the inference is that it
was guided by government policy).

16. The inferred authorities on misinformation are those either: regulated directly or indirectly by

government, or influenced by government decision making, such as those: financially dependent
on government and medical practitioners (who are required to conform to their own regulatory body,
itself swayed by government policy, for fear of being unable to practise), evidenced by censorship and
users of digital platforms being directed elsewhere:

“credible information”, “trusted sources such as the WHO and Red Cross” (Facebook);

“the Australian Red Cross Twitter account and resources“(Twitter);

_“Twitter introduces a timeline prompt to link Australian users with the Australian Government Department_
_of Health’s COVID-19 landing page providing information on vaccines and vaccination“ (page 120);_

_“Facebook launches a global policy prohibiting advertising that discourages vaccination: Under the policy,_
_advertising that advocates a particular position on the government’s policy on vaccines would not_
_necessarily contravene Facebook’s Community Standards”;_

“TikTok places restrictions on advertising on its platform, including a prohibition against advertising that
_advocates against vaccination”;_

_“Only official government apps and verified health apps which provide medical or support services related_
_to COVID-19 or which support local responses, may leverage COVID-19 related keywork searches in the_
_Google Play Store”; (page 103)_

_“Facebook launches the Facebook Coronavirus Information Center, providing a centralised location for users_
_to access news and information about COVID19. In Australia, the_ _Center includes official Australian_
_Government information.”_ (Page 102) one has to ask did an Australian prepare this report?

20


-----

17. Observed in the ACMA Report are financial ties (indicative of partnerships with government and

potential conflicts of interest) between digital and claimed credible mainstream platforms, where
financial incentives are employed in the effort to denounce deemed “misinformation”.

_“Platforms have …provided financial assistance and grants to news outlets and government and not-for-_
_profit organisations to bolster the spread of credible information and news” (page 98)…..“Google provides_

18. It is a circulatory argument to claim that digital platforms are incurring expense when they have

undertaken a task either under coercion, with the encouragement of government or even in
partnership with same. They still managed to make financials donations in support of this cause.

19. Under the current voluntary code there occurred censoring of elected members of parliament,

that is, representatives chosen by the people, an onslaught against democracy itself, providing
little confidence in the enactment of the flexible and modifiable proposed legislation:

_“Facebook permanently removes Craig Kelly MP’s Facebook and Instagram accounts for repeated_ _violations_
_of its COVID-19 misinformation policy._ _A Facebook spokesperson noted: ‘We don't allow anyone, including_
_elected officials, to share misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm or_
_COVID-19 vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts. We have clear policies against this_
_type of content and have removed Mr Kelly's Facebook Page for repeated violations of this policy’.241_ “(page
120-121)

20. We are unable to validate the conclusions of the ACMA Report as research informing it was to

remain confidential per the report and Fact sheet 1 and 2. The misinformation qualifying process
suffers from similar limitations. Collectively indicative of the partiality the process of
implementation may take, should the Bill be enacted into legislation.

_“The ACMA acknowledges that some signatories have provided confidential data points to inform this_
_report. While this has assisted in the development of this report, we consider this data should have been_
_included in published reports” (page 74 report)_

_“The ACMA expected DIGI to undertake a full and open consultation on the code. On release of the draft_
_code, despite reaching out directly to a wide range of stakeholders, DIGI made little effort to attract a_
_broader range of public views. It did not put out a media statement, post an update on its social media_
_channels, or pursue any other public communication avenues to increase awareness of the consultation_
_process beyond those organisations it had originally identified” (page 42 report)_

_“Secondly, the ACMA is concerned there was a lack of opportunity for stakeholders to provide comment on_
_the content and drafting of the final code. A recurring observation among submitters was that that they_
_would have preferred if DIGI had engaged earlier or sought additional comments on a final draft before_
_launching the code” (Page 43 report)._

### 5G

5G has only had a recent roll-out. There has been little if no opportunity to observe its impact. What
criteria is there for declaring discussion about it unreasonable? Are all new ideas, including
communications around new technology, to be automatically labelled misinformation.

Available at the following links are just some, including authoritative, concerns raised:

There have been elected parliamentarians who disagree with the premises that CO2 causes global

are also other professionals with some standing who have provided different opinions to those
currently impacting public policy, including: Green Peace founder Patrick Moore and Dr Nils-Axel

## THE STATISTICS - Covid-19 

It is demonstrated in the government’s own statistical records that lockdowns, other restrictions and
vaccination, though conveniently increased vaccination uptake, inconveniently for the public proved
unsuccessful in combating the impact of disease attributed to Covid.

Australians have a right to question public policy in a democracy, particularly where a balance of risks
must be weighed up and informed consent given to an invasive unproperly tested novice medical
procedure.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been prolonging the release of their Provisional Mortality
Statistics.

The latest **Causes of Death Australia was** released 19th October 2022, the reference period 2021.

Otherwise, we must rely upon the Provisional Mortality Statistics.

Below is a simple examination of deaths in Australia recorded as attributed to covid-19 prior to and
following mass vaccination when we see a marked and obvious increase.

Deaths have less confounders than rates of disease:

The PCR test, for example, is looking for a small genetic sequence match said to belong to SARS-Cov-2 the virus
said to cause Covid-19, which test can produce more positive results the greater the number of amplification
cycles the sample is put through. It is a quantitative test and does not diagnose disease.

There are also observed excess deaths since the introduction of mass covid vaccination.

### New South Wales  A Snapshot as of June 2021 (screen shots are expandable)

Prior to mass vaccine uptake in NSW, where there was only a relatively short period of lockdown in
March 2021. It could be argued that there was either no deadly virus or the restrictions imposed
were better than the vaccine. However efficacious claimed to be during the limited trial period, the
vaccines administered demonstrate a lack of effectiveness in the real world, whether attributed to
variants or not.

**NSW weekly surveillance report published 7.1.22 – table screen shot is expandable.**

This is the last weekly report showing deaths for each 6-month period from beginning 2020 and
cumulative totals. Consequently, no further prior and after comparisons can be made in the one
report.

### In summary, it can be seen from the above two tables that:
 There were 372 deaths (likely more, due to delay in confirmation) reported in NSW Health Media Release 28.9.21:  https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20210928_00.aspx

### In summary:

Looking at the latest ABS Provisional Mortality Report and daily Commonwealth reports (providing a
snapshot which varied daily), for which the reference sources are listed above:

There were 7,311 deaths attributed to covid Australia wide as at the 4.5.22, while only 911 deaths
attributed to covid prior to the commencement of mass vaccination. 905 deaths recorded Australia
wide for 2020 and 912 (a further 6) deaths recorded to the beginning of June 2021, following which a
significant rise: **2,698 deaths attributed to covid-19 as at** **18.1.22;** **4,201** as at 7.2.22; 6,693 as at
**15.4.22, correlating with a massive surge in vaccine and subsequent booster uptake.**
https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid-19-mortality-australia-deaths-registered-31-january2022#deaths-due-to-covid-19-in-australia

It should be borne in mind, of the 911 deaths attributed to covid-19 Australia wide recorded in 2020,
**678 occurred in aged residential care.**
[https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/06/covid-19-outbreaks-in-australian-](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/06/covid-19-outbreaks-in-australian-residential-aged-care-facilities-4-june-2021.pdf)

Most deaths occurred around typical flu season, while Flu and pneumonia deaths decreased in 2020
and 2021 (nil flu deaths from July 2020, until a single death was recorded in July 2021 and another in
October 2021, while there were 1080 deaths attributed to flu in 2019).
https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid-19-mortality-australia-deaths-registered-31-october-2021

Death rates reduced from Oct/Nov 2020 to mid-July 2021, even though this included a flu season
period. Following the mass vaccine campaign there was a significant upsurge in deaths attributed to
covid in Australia, including into the summer months. It would appear that we were no longer just
seeing a replacement for flu, but, applying Occam's razor, potential vaccine harm.

Most deaths attributed to covid having acute respiratory symptoms listed as a consequence, in
addition to other conditions listed on the death certificate (91.0%). There were significantly more
deaths recorded attributed to respiratory diseases other than covid in 2020 and 2021.
[https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid-19-mortality-australia-deaths-registered-31-january-2022](https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid-19-mortality-australia-deaths-registered-31-january-2022)

There were 15,805 all cause deaths recorded in January, 2022 (registered by 31 March, 2022), 2,865
**or 22.1%** **more than the historical average. Increases were seen for cancers, heart disease,**
cerebrovascular disease and dementia - similar health outcomes to reported Adverse Events (AE's)
following the administration of covid vaccines.

Despite high vaccination uptake in Australia, after cancers, doctor-certified deaths due to COVID-19
were the second most common cause of death in January 2022.

## Excess deaths

### The situation post-mass vaccination with respect to excess deaths and reported adverse events following vaccination:

There were 190,775 deaths which occurred in 2022. This is significantly higher than usual and is not
considered to be a typical year for mortality in Australia.
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/jan-apr-2023

COVID-19 is still a significant contributor to increased mortality:

In response to the emergence of COVID-19 the WHO issued new emergency codes to be used when
coding causes of death for statistical purposes.

**Pre-existing chronic conditions were reported on death certificates for 12,126 (81.2%) of the 14,941**
deaths due to COVID-19 deaths outlined in this report.

### ABS MORTALITY REPORTS
 Causes of Death Australia released 19.10.22 – reference period 2021.

Australia recorded significantly lower than expected mortality during the first year of the COVID-19
**pandemic with death rates reaching historical lows. Deaths decreased across many causes, but the**
**decrease in respiratory disease deaths was most notable.**

**The roll out of COVID-19 vaccines began in February 2021.**

All top five leading causes of death are non-communicable diseases (they are not passed from person
to person).

The majority of deaths (92.3%) assigned as being due to the COVID-19 vaccine have open coronial
cases meaning they are in scope of the ABS revisions process.

Influenza and pneumonia did not appear in the 20 leading causes of death for the first time in the ten
year time series.

There were 1,122 deaths from COVID-19, ranking as the 34th leading cause of death. Pneumonia was
the most common acute disease outcome and was present in 60.0% of COVID-19 deaths in 2021,
compared with 31.2% of COVID-19 deaths in 2020.

There were 2 people who died from influenza, which is the lowest number of annual flu deaths on
record. This compares to 55 in 2020 and 1,076 in 2019.

https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/2021

### Provisional Mortality Statistics Reference period Jan - Dec 2022, released 31/3/23.

**In 2022, there were 190,394 deaths that occurred by 31 December and were registered by 28 February**
2023, which is 25,235 (15.3%) more than the historical average.

There were 10,095 deaths due to COVID-19 in 2022 (9,732 doctor certified and 363 coroner-referred).
A further 2,901 deaths were due to other causes but had COVID-19 as a contributing factor (i.e. were
deaths "with COVID-19").

**For all deaths:**

 - In 2022, there were 190,394 deaths that occurred by 31 December and were registered by 28
February 2023. This is 25,235 deaths (15.3%) more than the baseline average.

 - In December there were 15,345 deaths, 2,017 (15.1%) above the historical average.

 - 13,446 of the deaths occurring in December 2022 were doctor certified and 1,899 were coroner
referred.

 - The age-standardised death rate (SDR) for December 2022 was 43.3 deaths per 100,000 people,
above the baseline average of 40.9.

### Can we really blame the significant rise in deaths following mass vaccination

 uptake on variants when methodology utilised isn’t truly scientific?

In the limited time available to me to complete the Appendix to this Submission, I provide the following
summary of scientific papers relied upon to inform a pandemic, which summary contents can be
evaluated for yourself by reading the scientific papers themselves.

Below appears a reference source list of the scientific papers relied upon around the globe to assert a
novel virus, SARS-Coc-2, as the cause of an asserted new disease named Covid-19.

These scientific papers, asserted as demonstrating (in vitro) isolation of a novel virus and informing a
pandemic at the time, relied upon unscientific methodology, lacked controls and evidence of causality
(Koch’s, or even the lesser River’s, postulates).

Bearing in mind that viruses are expected to exist, but not readily, if ever, found.

Lack of evidence for a novel virus referred to as SARS-CoV-2 and lack of any novel disease called Covid19 is identifiable by:

  - No proper and complete isolation of any whole and intact virus to which a true surrogate endpoint
(in this case genetic sequences used for the PCR test) can then be matched.

  - The cytopathic effects observed during culturing of samples, [samples taken from just a few
subjects, where there was unknown, if any, controls with which to compare results], asserted as
indicative of a pathogenic virus, are easily attributable to poisoning and/or deprivation of
nutrients (noting that in the Australian paper referenced below they had to add Trypsin, which is
harmful to kidneys, cells used for culture, to result in the CPE typically asserted as evidence of a
virus). Neither are these observed cytopathic effects, which are held out as evidence of the
existence of a novel virus, unique in electron microscopy.

**Appearances Can Be Deceiving - Viral-like Inclusions in COVID-19 Negative Renal Biopsies by**
**[Electron Microscopy https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/8/824](https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/1/8/824)**

  - Selected disordered genetic fragments obtained from culturing human samples are assembled in
silico (modelled by programmed computer software) aligned to a presupposed bat/coronavirus
provide the subsequently registered genetic sequences relied upon for the PCR test, so as to
confirm those sequences came from a specific virus.

  - genetic sequences that are not novel, when conducting an NIH Blast search.

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is publicly available, allowing anyone to compare
published nucleotide sequences with all those stored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NIH) genetic database called GenBank: [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)

33


-----

While lacking evidence in those scientific papers as to the asserted virus SARS-Cov-2 causing a disease
called Covid-19, other pertinent factors include (ascertained in reference sources and links provided
previously):

   - A wide array of symptoms that could be attributed to any disease.

   - At least 91% of comorbidities in those asserted to have died from covid-19 prior to mass
vaccination.

   - Changes to statistical collection methodology, coding/prioritizing covid-19 as a cause of death.

   - Attributing cases, with no illness present - testing positive didn’t reflect illness.

   - By ignoring the first 7- 14 days following a vaccine dose, it excludes from analysis the possibility
of vaccine ineffectiveness - an equivalent explanation to that of having already contracted the
virus or any other argument for excluding the 7–14-day period following a vaccine dose.

   - Potential inadequate treatment administered potentially exacerbating deaths.

### - Reliance upon an inappropriate test to determine disease impact and inform a pandemic,
further creating circulatory arguments based upon assumption – the PCR test is not diagnostic,
it amplifies genetic sequences to find them, with varying results based on cycle thresholds used.
Thresholds employed above 35 are said to create false positives but were still employed.

One patient, no healthy subject as a control. There had been no sharing of any intact whole
virus, so we are dependent upon China's asserted sequencing of a novel virus registered and

35

shared globally. Notice how they needed to add Trypsin (harmful to kidneys used in the cell
culture) to get the CPE typically asserted as evidence of a virus.

**The State of the Science**

Editors of the world’s most respected medical journals, Dr. Richard Horton, Editor-in-chief of the
**Lancet and Dr. Marcia Angell, physician, and long-time Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical**
**Journal, have made public statements declaring a significant amount of published research is**
unreliable at best, if not false, even fraudulent. **Professor Joseph Ross of Yale Medical School is**
reported to hold the view that the entire evidence base has been perverted.

It appears the whole peer review process is now relied upon to maintain the status quo of science,
prevent advances and anything that challenges the established view, including the exclusion of things
that do not fit that view.

**Philanthropic power**

Philanthropic power has increasing significant influence on agenda-setting and the funding priorities
of international organizations, including program priorities of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO),
governments and global development policy. Particularly large philanthropic foundations, through the
sheer size of their grant-making, networking and advocacy capabilities (most notably the Rockefeller
_Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)._

Philanthropic power significantly influences the setting of WHO’s program priorities.

_“it is not only “big business” but also “big philanthropy” that has an increasing influence in global_
_(development) policy, particularly large philanthropic foundations…Through the sheer size of their grant-_
_making, personal networking and active advocacy, large global foundations, most notably the Rockefeller_
_Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have played an increasingly active role in shaping the_
_agenda-setting and funding priorities of international organizations and governments….The findings of the_
_study range from the foundations’ application of a business model to the measurement of results, their_
_influence on policies and agenda-setting, the fragmentation and weakening of global governance, and the lack_
_of transparency and accountability mechanisms.”_

The U.S. government is the largest state member funder of WHO. The Gates Foundation is the largest
non-state funder of the WHO, having donated more than $2B in earmarked grants to the international
health agency since 1998. Because the Gates Foundation grant money is earmarked for specific
programs, such as vaccine purchase, delivery and promotion, the Gates Foundation significantly
influences the setting of WHO’s program priorities. Australia’s vaccination policies have been designed
from the recommendations provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) under Global Health
Policies. The WHO receives these recommendations from an advisory group called the Global Alliance
for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).

The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) is an advisory group that includes the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Federation of Pharmaceutical Companies, the
Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and many other private-public
partnerships. This group cannot provide objective science that is in the public's best interest due to its
promotion of corporate interests in government policies and global economic markets. It cannot

36


-----

provide objective advice about disease control because many of these private-public organisations
profit from the vaccines they recommend to the WHO.

And Through the WHO's International Health Regulations (guided by the GAVI alliance) all countries,
regardless of their public health needs, have been required to sign up to a set of actions that they will
take if the WHO declares a 'pandemic'.

Most representatives on vaccine advisory boards have financial or other conflicts of interests (COI)
with pharmaceutical companies. For instance, prior to becoming the head of Gavi in 2011, Dr. Berkley
worked for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rockefeller Foundation, the
Carter Center and served on the Boards of Vaxinnate Corp, Napo Pharmaceuticals and Powderjet
Pharmaceuticals.

**Conflicts of Interest**

To begin with there are inherent conflicts of interest in conventional medical practice from the
licensure of pharmaceuticals (drug companies undertake their own studies to present to the TGA for
_licensure) to the revolving door between regulatory bodies and those employed in the pharmaceutical_
industry. As examples: Dr Julie Gerberding (named woman of the year in 2018) was Director for the
Centers of Disease Control and Population (CDC) from 2002 to 2009 when Joining Merck & C Inc and
becoming executive vice president for strategic communications, global public policy and population
health. Also holding stock in that company.

Terry Nolan, chairman of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) 2005 to
December 2014 declared having been a member of a CSL vaccine advisory board, receiving nominal
payments as well as support for conference attendance from CSL Ltd, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline.
He was also the chief investigator of the clinical trial for CSL’s Panvax influenza vaccine in 2009 while
on the government’s primary advisory boards for vaccination policy-decisions and deputy chairman of
the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) that determines funding allocation for
research projects. (Nolan T, McVernon J, Skeljo M, Richmond P, Wadia U, Lambert S, et al. Immunogenicity of a
**Monovalent 2009 Influenza Vaccine in Infants and Children: A Randomised Trial. Jama. 2010 jan 6:303 (1): 37-46:**
