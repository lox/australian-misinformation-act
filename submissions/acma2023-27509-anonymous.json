    "Key Arguments": [
      "The proposed ACMA powers could undermine legal due process and freedom of speech.",
      "The definitions of misinformation and disinformation in the bill are unclear and poorly defined.",
      "Judicial processes, not regulatory bodies, should determine the truthfulness of information.",
      "The bill could stifle democratic debate and lean towards autocratic control.",
      "There is a need for greater transparency and accountability in decision-making processes."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [
      "Freedom of Speech",
      "Legal Due Process",

    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The definitions provided lack the clarity required to protect freedom of speech and expression while minimising harm from disinformation.",
      "A simple example of de-contextualised truth that I suspect will be classified as misleading information is, 'None of the COVID-19 vaccines have long term safety studies'.",
      "The bill seems intentionally vaguely worded and is absent of the proper checks and balances that allows it to be used fairly."
