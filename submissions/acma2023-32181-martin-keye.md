I do not agree that “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”

During the last three years, for example, we have witnessed the situation where “so-called”
misinformation and disinformation has proved to be correct with the passage of time.
Accusations of misinformation and disinformation were used as propaganda and intimidation tools
by both government and large corporate interests.

Freedom of speech should not be feared. For sure there will be untruthful or biased information
presented on social media platforms, but these ideas will be challenged by truthful information.

It is simply too dangerous to have a small group of people in powerful positions adjudicate what is
correct information.
