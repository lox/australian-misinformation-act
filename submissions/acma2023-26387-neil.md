This legislation is totalitarian in nature and has no place in a supposedly free and democratic society.

Truth has no fear of scrutiny whilst lies need the truth to be suppressed to take root.

Putting the power of deciding what is truth into the hands of those in power is dangerous and will be
abused given human nature.

The fact that this legislation is being proposed shows that we are heading down a dark path into
censorship and Orwell-esque control.
