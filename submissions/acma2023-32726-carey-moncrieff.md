17[th] August 2023

**I give my consent to this submission being made public.**

I write to voice my absolute and vehement opposition to the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This sort of censorship
and control has no place in a free and democratic country such as ours.

Censorship, no matter what it is called, and precision of language is most important in this
discussion, is the sign of an unhealthy and fragile society where those governing feel threatened by
their own electors, those whom they are tasked with serving. It is a signal that those in charge are
failing in their duty to listen to and carry out the will of the electorate and fear them rather than look
to their own failings. Dissenting voices are vital in democracies, if only to point out that the king
has no clothes. On the other hand, grubby and distasteful ideas force us to ask ‘Are we truly like
that?’ confronting those things which lurk in the depth of our collective psyche as a nation finally
rejecting them because we know that they are there and they are wrong. Suppressing them allows
them to fester and grow in darkness. On both fronts, censorship is deleterious to society.

To deny freedom of speech is to deny democracy itself. Absolute freedom of speech, which
necessarily includes the ability to voice ‘dangerous’ ideas was essential for the rise of democratic
ideas and nations in the 18[th] Century which overthrew oppressive and stultifying societal structures
thus leading to the formation of the Western World and all that has arisen from that ideal. We
would not be here in this place and time without this right of expression. Thomas Paine’s
‘dangerous’ ideas directly influenced the founders of the United States in their writing of the
Constitution of the United States and this was a very real influence on the fathers of our own
constitution, that of the Commonwealth of Australia. These men were only too aware in the drafting
of that document of the dangers in being too prescriptive or proscriptive and tempered their words
accordingly to prevent this nation falling into the trap of hard-line dogma bolstered by the inability
to question it.

The Bill itself is very poorly conceived and loosely worded. It mentions ‘harm’ to a number of
entities including ‘health’ and the ‘environment’ but, who is it that defines what this harm is? This
is a very broad statement which would allow a broad number of things to be called harmful. Is my
calling someone a name on line harmful and therefore subject to provisions outlined? Is the
statement of a verifiable, objective fact which offends someone harmful? Would advising someone
to take a vaccine which subsequently proves to be harmful fall under those provisions? The
incidences are far too many to list and provide a too broad avenue for abuse. Many of these would
be covered under existing laws any way. Loose definitions are notoriously easy to manipulate in the
pursuit of nefarious ends and in politics it is all too easy to lose integrity in pursuit of a political aim.
The past is littered with many examples of this.

That deeming something harmful or dangerous can be misleading or wrong in itself is amply
demonstrated by our recent health crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic many ideas were portrayed
as dangerous and harmful, not because they were wrong in themselves but because they defied the
decided course of action of the government, much of which itself has since been proven to be
erroneous. Suggestions that the approved vaccines had not been properly tested were termed
misinformation. Early assertions that the ‘vaccines’ did not stop transmission of the virus were
erroneously called misinformation. The idea that the virus came from a Chinese laboratory was
similarly labelled misinformation. Questioning the entire Covid-19 narrative itself was given the
name misinformation by the government. The absolute propaganda surrounding all of this was
relentless, offensive and damaging to us as a nation. Much of this ‘misinformation’ has since been
proven to be true through various rigorous studies undertaken by qualified and respected individuals
around the world. If a government can get something like this so very and bloody-mindedly wrong,

I do not see how they be trusted with such a responsibility in future when deciding that something is
‘misinformation’.

Such a bill also displays a distrust of the good sense of the people themselves. Australians have
proven themselves time and again to be able to discern a good idea from a bad one and have acted
accordingly in various referenda. Menzies’ attempt to censor and ultimately ban the Australian
Communist Party at the height of anti-communist hysteria failed because Australians in their
collective wisdom were able to see the underlying danger to democracy through what was being
proposed. They saw that an idea or movement being banned was a double-edged weapon which
could be turned against anyone or any group in society if the right conditions prevailed. It
frightened them more than the very real malice the communists harboured against democracy.
Likewise, they had the sense and compassion to allow the constitutional change of 1967 to occur,
again because they thought the concept through and saw the inherent fairness of voting yes to that
proposal despite the emotional hype going on around the referendum. Censorship treats people as
infantile and is insulting. It betrays a profound mistrust of the democratic system and the people
themselves. And they know this instinctively.

Nothing good has ever come from censorship. Societies which resort to censorship ultimately
wither and die through a lack of pollination of ideas. It stifles progress in both society and science.
One only has to mention Galileo to understand this. His assertions about the solar system were
equivalent to ‘misinformation’ according to the church of the time as his ideas, though true,
conflicted with the dogma of the church which was concerned with propping up church hegemony.
His teachings were suppressed for quite a while and only really gained acceptance in the later
Renaissance, the beginning of the flowering of Western intellectual tradition which led to the
Enlightenment where science and dangerous ideas colluded in an explosion of creativity and
endeavour to create our modern world. Who is to say that a modern government would not resort to
political censorship in a similar effort to bolster power under the guise of online ‘misinformation’
causing ‘harm’ thus stifling real progress? The works of the aforementioned Thomas Paine would
certainly have been subject to the misinformation label despite their obvious and real benefits for us
all in today’s Western World. In fact, he was derided by one James Chalmers (no relation, I am sure)
at the time because it was felt his ideas might lead to a degeneration of society into democracy, an
apparently horrific prospect for some.

Ultimately, this bill is a very underhanded way of a government imposing censorship as the
Constitution itself prevents government from doing so directly. Getting a third party in the form of
powerful social media platforms to do the work prohibited in our founding document for a very
good reason could be interpreted is a betrayal of the spirit and safeguards of democracy which that
document sought to implant in the heart of our society. It is an attempt to circumvent the integrity of
our country itself and undermine its foundation. It is an indication of the depths to which our
political integrity has fallen that governments of both stripes seek to put in place an instrument
which could be corrupted to suppress truthful and honest discourse by the people, no matter how
distasteful it may be to some. It is a fact that ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’ for grubby and murky
thoughts and actions. The already proven good sense of the Australian people as a collective,
imbued as they are with a universal wish for equality, should be trusted to see anything truly
harmful for what it is and reject it on its own terms. A government which seeks to tell people what
they should or should not think, even by de facto means, ceases to be a truly democratic
government and has started on the slope into authoritarianism and unwarranted control.

I oppose this amendment as a fundamental change in the character and tenor of this nation for the
worse. It is to be opposed as a possible instrument of co-ercion and control and is offensive to the
spirit of democracy.
