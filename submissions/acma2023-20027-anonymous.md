# Submission re Misinformation and
 Disinformation Bill

The proposed law is advocating the following:

The proposed powers would:

  - enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or require
them to keep certain records about matters regarding misinformation and
disinformation

  - enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures
to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA
could register and enforce

  - allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of
regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting
misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.

This Bill and its proposed powers are frightening and my family and I oppose its
contents completely.

For only one Government body to regulate what is the truth and what is not is
unacceptable. This is what China has been doing for the last 50 years. Australia and
other open Western countries have opposed the lack of free press and the lack of
freedom of speech in China. Why would we want to go down the communist route and
restrict Australians from free speech? It opens up the whole government to the
possibility of corruption and bad decisions. Australia need scrutiny not more restriction.

Australians need to be in a free democracy so that people can choose for themselves;
with our own mind what information we want to accept as true or false. The government
has no business choosing what we should be reading/viewing.

We all have different belief systems. What I classify is true may be completely differently
too from what ACMA determines as true.

It’s quite evident that some Social media platforms have censored people’s views and
voices, even when scientists and proven facts were given. I for one don’t want this to be
extended to Government.

There is evidence that some Government agencies are still pushing and advocating for
controlling narratives especially with respect to the recent covid vaccines. This Bill
could further enhance and weaponise these government agencies further.

In this bill the government is exempt from these rules of misinformation? Please explain
how this is fair?

What I deem as factual and science like issues around climate change, vaccines, gender,
which can be shown with evidence-based information on biology and based on scientists
can be just dismissed by the ACMA and will not be heard

People are allowed to disagree in respectful manners.

Please stand for all Australian and under natural law, common law of human rights of
freedom of speech.

Allow people to view and share their opinions and facts in a fair democracy.

I advocate for our future generations. Let us be one Australian people to unite us not
divide us.

I am very concerned, father, husband and professional worker.
