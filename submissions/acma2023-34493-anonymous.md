Hello,

I am writing to express concern regarding the Misinformation/ Disinformation Bill that has been put
forth for consideration by the Albanese Labor Party. I agree with Aristotle when he said “It’s the
mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” That being said, I
believe everyone has the right to freedom of thought, freedom of speech & the freedom to accept
& implement ideas that may be different to the current consensus.

As an example, I will relate the story of Ignaz Semmelweis, a German/ Hungarian physician who was
suppressed & disgraced for spreading misinformation. This dear doctor worked in a hospital where
he observed that the deathrate from childbed fever was 3x greater when delivered by doctors
instead of midwives. After careful observation he discovered that that the doctors  came straight
from an autopsy to deliver a baby, never washing their hands whilst the midwives always washed
theirs. After trying to educate his colleagues he was moved on to another clinic where he had the
opportunity to implement his ideas – the death rate dropped from 18.3% to  2.2% then to 0% the
following year. It remained the same at the previous clinic.

His colleagues responded with outrage, insisting that the medical establishment couldn’t possibly be
the cause – it was caused by an imbalance of the 4 humours! In 1865 his colleagues had him
committed to a mental asylum, where he was put into a straightjacket & beaten. He died from his
injuries 14 days later. So the deaths continued for years to come, until the idea of hand washing was
finally accepted. The dear doctor was 100% correct but had died a terrible death for ‘spreading
misinformation’.

If we are to be treated like children in a ‘nanny state’, being censored & denied information, what
opportunities may we miss? It’s vitally important to be open to ideas that we may not all agree with,
that we have the freedom to choose ourselves, without Government overreach.

I watched a program on SBS during the week where a lady was describing life in Nazi Germany & one
of the first things to appear was censorship. Censorship poses a threat to our personal liberties &
freedom & to our democratic society. I sincerely hope that this bill will be nipped in the bud before it
has the opportunity to take root & possibly do much harm.
