This is a submission. I am a born and bred Australian and love my country, and feel very strongly about the freedoms we and
many generations have enjoyed.....they are are a part of our way of life...they make us who we are today. I am deeply concerned
about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the internet can be used to promote all kinds of
information, some of which is untrue. But the answer is not to make the government the arbiter of truth and to censor those it
disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of bad ideas with an open critique of those bad ideas is the
only way the truth can prevail.This bill could curtail and even prevent this debate, particularly in our elected Government, in all
States.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience. Our nation
had it right all along. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it.

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

As far as "disinformation" there are many laws already in place that cover such things as hate crimes, vandalising critical towers
etc. If anything is harmful medically, it should only be disclosed through our legitimate medical authorities and laws.....not through
"communications".

I strongly reject this proposal.
