I do not support the proposed bill. In implementation it will result in more control of free speech by
transferring powers to determine what is misinformation and disinformation to unaccountable
administrative agencies.

Our liberal democracy was founded on the principal of free speech and the rule of law. If people
have intentionally harmed and misled people, it should be dealt with by the appropriate law.

The definitions of misinformation and disinformation are imprecise and could be used to capture
many instances of political dissent and genuine debate - two of the freedoms that have enable
Australia to be a robust and prosperous democracy. This bill will diminish these fought for freedoms
and ultimately weaken our democracy, which is why I oppose it.

The application of what is considered misinformation and disinformation is arbitrary and won't apply
to misinformation from governments or media outlets. This is not acceptable. All should be
accountable and should be made accountable in public, not decided by unaccountable
administrative agencies and the anonymous fact checkers may be brought in to assist. Social media
companies can censor information and views without any real foundation or on request, as was seen
in the Twitter files, where people with legitimate views and debates were censored for information
that is now known to be true.

There are no provisions about the openness and fairness of the process nor recourse for information
that is fact checked as false but later shown to be true. Australians will not be exposed to views that
are vital to stimulate debate in a dynamic liberal democracy.

This bill is not fit to proceed as the definitions are imprecise, open to subjective interpretation, will
result in politically motivated censorship and the loss of free speech. The power to declare
misinformation and disinformation by unaccountable administrative bodies breeds secrecy and is
not a positive step to improve our democracy and protect Australians from harm.
