# New ACMA Powers to restrict Misinformation and Disinformation

 After reading the proposed legislation I am extremely concerned for the democracy of our nation. This is one of the most concerning Bills I have ever been aware of.

 While it may be argued that foreign powers should be restricted in what they might peddle on digital platforms accessed by Australians, it is all too easy an excuse to use this to “cancel” sensible discourse on digital platforms and media outlets that are contrary to Government proclamations of ‘truth’.

 The most obvious recent examples are the lies, misinformation and disinformation peddled by the Government during the Covid pandemic where many of the things once considered true, such as Covid Vaccines stopping transmission, turned out to be false.

 Free citizens must be able to disagree and argue a case anywhere, including on digital platforms and the Government must NEVER be the arbiter of truth, being the one who determines what can or cannot be said. The whole idea of this legislation is an anti-Australian, anti-democratic, totalitarian disgrace which I cannot believe that I am even seeing in our country.

 The legislation must be scrapped completely. If legislation is needed to control foreign interference in digital spaces, it must be very specific to that issue, with evidence it is occurring, and the general discourse of Australian individuals and media outlets left alone. The Government need to get out of our lives, not keep encroaching and over-reaching into our freedoms.
