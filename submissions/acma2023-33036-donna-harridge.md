Dear Prime Minister,

Why do you want to change democratic Australia to be the same as communist China?

The “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill you are proposing will mean the end of free
speech for all Australians.

Like Communist China the government and their agencies are exempt from adhering to this Bill.
However in the last three years the biggest promoter of misinformation and lies has come from the
government . I haven’t heard an apology for the ‘harm ‘ the government has caused to the health of
many Australians due to their failed ‘vaccines’ which were promoted as being safe, would stop you
getting covid or transmitting it. Instead there has been excess deaths of 17% the last three years
since the rollout of the covid jab and the adverse reports continue to grow .

During the covid pandemic, views and information held by esteemed doctors and scientists from
top universities around the world were silenced . Any opposing view to the government’s agenda
was shut down. Now we know what the government was promoting as disinformation has proven to
be fact.

This week has demonstrated exactly what will happen consistently with any views expressed by
journalists that are opposed to the government agenda . For example esteemed journalist Peta
Credlin exposed Anthony Albanese lying about the Voice being one page long. When Sky posted
Peta Credlin’s editorial on Facebook a week later Big Tech censors blanked it out .

This type of censorship is disgusting.

Australians have prospered up to now without the government ‘protecting’ them. Our Democracy
and Freedom of Speech must be maintained at all costs.

The introducing of ACMA ‘s Misinformation and Disinformation Bill must not proceed.
