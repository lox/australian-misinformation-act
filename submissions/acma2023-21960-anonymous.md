Re: ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

I am against this submission - without being able to debate, to talk, to discuss
different ideas and situations we would be living in a communist state. I was on
thyroid medication for 15 years because no one had educated my GP that
hypothyroidism is greatly due to eating gluten and dairy and not having enough
iodine and selenium in your diet each day. This submission would say I was going
against or that I was wrong and yet I have gotten off my medication all through
changing my diet

Over the past 3 years all the information that was being ridiculed as conspiracy
theory has actually proven to be true.

I do not accept that those in government are not liable as the same as everyone
else for what they say. I want to live in a free country, with free speech and have
the ability to decide for myself what I believe, what I put into my body, and what I
want to talk about.
