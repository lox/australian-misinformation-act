**Two conflicting systems of truth**

The Federal Government's ACMA legislation seeks to censor 'misinformation' and
'disinformation', pretending that there could never be any legitimate debate over what might fit
those definitions, all political biases aside.

Most important is that the inescapable premise of censorship is that there is a 'right' and a
'wrong' within information, which only has validity within an OBJECTIVE (modernist)
truth-system (e.g. all sciences are objective in nature). Yet this is entirely contradicts the
favoured truth-system of current Left-leaning governments, (post-modernism), with a
SUBJECTIVE approach to truth (e.g. the LGBTQI+ ideology with its many genders - where truth
is what feels right to each individual). This is the very opposite of a scientific approach to gender
which discovers only two.

There is a glaring hypocrisy in a government holding two irreconcilable systems of truth
together, using one as a political cudgel for the sake of embracing the other. This is a major
obstacle to the credibility of censorship legislation put forward by this government.

**Unresolvable dilemma for the sciences**

Again, conflicting with its subjectively-founded agendas, governments answering to the political
Left and Globalists champion Climate Change, a quintessentially modernist science. Embracing
both demonstrates philosophical naivete and incoherence.

Yet science is a precarious pursuit, vulnerable as it is to the problem of 'induction', which
philosophers over the centuries have agreed robs science of absolute certainty, making it
always susceptible to wildcard observations which can collapse long-held scientific theories with
a single observation. Climate Change
is a science that, in fact, collapses under the weight of a single contradicting observation - more
than 30 years of global cooling in the midst of steadily rising CO2 emissions. There is clearly a
confounder powerful enough to reverse warming, and as with confounders, it may well be that it
(the sun or some other unknown vector) is responsible for the warming AND the cooling. This
illustrates well the problem with science - it is always open to debate and falsification.

Any government that wishes to censor on the basis of a fixed and unchanging science has to
explain why centuries of philosophy has warned of its achilles heel, and why they think science
should no longer be subject to change and debate which censorship destroys.

The other truth problem for a censoring government is values, like whether marriage should
include something other than a human male and female. This is not a scientific question. Values
are influenced by each individual's personality and predisposition in an interplay with survey and
scientific data. If governments want to censor aspects of the latter, it must be considered a
mechanism of the social control of values and thereby the anti-democratic control of people.

The US is the world's most focused country on democracy and freedom, which comprehends all
of the above points thus made. On 4 July 2023, a US court shot down as unconstitutional the
Biden government's activity of the last two years where they have directed media censorship of
political speech they don't like. There is no difference between what our Federal Government is
proposing and what has just been condemned in defense of democracy in the United States.
Quite evidently our proposed legislation shows utter contempt for free speech, the foundation of
democracy.

**Government as source of mis/disinformation**

The Federal Government's ACMA legislation operates on the assumption that governments can
ably divine the truth in any field of inquiry.

Unfortunately, over the last three years Western governments have provided irrefutable
evidence demonstrating that they indeed are the most guilty of peddling misinformation and
disinformation. This puts them in the invidious position of wanting to censor the very type of
information that will establish their guilt. This leads to a rank and dangerous hypocrisy.

This document will take three lines of evidence on such government misinformation and
disinformation, fourthly discussing how media censorship extant in Australia leads to the loss of
many Australian lives.

**Specific government misinformation**

The two areas of government misinformation are:

**_1. Gross misinformation about COVID and vaccines_**

Rigorous evidence is given against the following government misinformation assertions:

- COVID is a 'novel' coronavirus

- t is a terrifying and deadly virus

- here are enormous death tolls

- he 'vaccines' are actual vaccines

- he vaccines are safe.

- he vaccines are effective

- It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated

- There are no viable therapies

- Lockdowns are necessary

- Masks will stop the spread

- People with no symptoms are a threat

- We have to censor dissenting voices

Rigorous evidence is also given to demonstrate that this government misinformation has had
deadly consequences:


-----

- Australian excess deaths are running at 15% above the historical average

- It's the vaccinated filling our hospitals â€¢ Excess deaths are more amongst the vaccinated

**_2. Misinformation and censorship regarding the 2020 US election_**

Rigorous evidence includes:

- xiomatic (absolute) certainty of a stolen election from the numerical relationship between
voter rolls and voter turnout

- Mathematical certainty of vote manipulation by analysing voter machine Cast Vote Records

- 32 terabytes of recorded computer traffic in packet captures covering almost all US counties
on the 2020 election night

- Other weighty verifications such as extensive video footage from government cameras of
2,000 Democrat ballot mules illegally stuffing multiple ballots in drop-boxes in multiple locations

This has led to an illegitimate government taking power, cancelling any semblance of
democracy.
The likelihood of various US vote rigging strategies being operative in our Australian elections is
likewise possible and demands investigation.

**Specific government disinformation**

Rigorous evidence demonstrates that the Biden government directly persuaded 51 intel-agency
high- ranking officials to lie about Hunter Biden's laptop e-mails, which demonstrate that he and
his father, President of the United States Joe Biden, were taking millions of dollars from China,
Ukraine and Romania, profiteering from influence-peddling activities since Joe Biden's days as
US Vice President.

16% of Democrat voters say they would not have voted for Biden if the lies had been exposed
and the truth not censored, indicating that the US has an illegitimate President. This clearly
dispels democracy.

**Censored Australia health data**

Australian media is overtly censoring the latest studies on the harms of cannabis which science
has recently shown to be causal in:

- 33 cancer types with Cannabidiol (CBD) the most cancer-causing at 12 cancers (versus 14
fortobacco)

- 9 of 95 birth defects

- 70% of pediatric cancer types Aging users by 30% by age 30

Censorship will clearly lead to deadly consequences.

**Conclusion**


-----

The Federal Government shows no competency or credibility in dealing with the very concept of
truth, taking an incoherent, opportunistic approach that bends it to its ideological objectives. For
this kind of government, censorship is not about truth but is rather the plaything of the powerful
to silence dissent and political diversity. It is vehemently anti-democratic and has a sordid
history of leading to tyranny.

Over the last three years Western governments have modeled incompetence and partisanship
in regards to mis/ disinformation, being its worst perpetrators. Governments conclusively cannot
be trusted with the truth and freedom of speech must be guarded at all costs. In light of all of the
above, the ACMA legislation is entirely indefensible.
