Dear Sir,

I would like to raise serious concerns about the misinformation and disinformation Bill.

To give new powers to a regulator would eradicate freedom of speech.

I am totally against the introduction of such laws and do not support this bill in any way.
I confirm this as a submission.
Submission can be published.

Regards,
Mark Dunne
