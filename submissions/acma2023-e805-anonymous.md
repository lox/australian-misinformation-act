I was deeply concerned to read recently about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the internet can
be used to promote all kinds of information, some of which is untrue, or at best, misleading. But the answer is not to make the
government the arbiter of truth and to censor those it disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of
bad ideas with an open critique of those bad ideas is the only way the truth can prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience. Our nation
had it right all along. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it.

The balance between freedom of expression, and protection for the vulnerable, is not always a clear path. But this proposed Bill
is not the answer. The idea that the government of the day is the highest authority on, and determiner of, truth, sends shivers
down my spine. Welcome to Orwell's "1984"!

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal.
