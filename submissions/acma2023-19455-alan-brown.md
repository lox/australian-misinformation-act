# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

In regard to the proposed Bill above, it is essen�al for all the public to be able to discuss and comment on all
subjects. For example, a deba�ng contest is between opposing sides so that an observer can come to a
conclusion on the topic as a result of hearing both sides of the arguments.

There is sufficient evidence in the last few years where governments and others have expressed a view that
was incorrect. Only by hearing dissen�ng views (and evidence) were the public and indeed others in
government posi�ons able to ascertain the actual truth.

To have legisla�on such as this Bill only mimics what the governments of China and North Korea are doing.
History has also recorded countries such a Russia and Nazi Germany did this same thing, as a result the
people were vilified and oppressed.

There is no augment that truth and misinforma�on is out in the public arena but only through viewing both
sides can an objec�ve understanding be obtained. Generally, the public is able to discern truth from
misinforma�on – but only having the liberty to view both sides of the augment. Removing either one is
going down the path of Totalitarianism, similar to countries men�oned above.

Australia is a democracy from which the word comes from the Greek words "demos", meaning people, and
"kratos" meaning power; so democracy can be thought of as "power of the people": a way of governing
which depends on the will of the people.

Australia does not define its na�onal iden�ty by race or religion, but by shared values, including poli�cal,
economic and religious freedom, liberal democracy, the rule of law, racial and gender equality and mutual
respect.

The proposed law will undermine this principle and move Australia to a Totalitarianism society. This is
defined as a form of government that a�empts to assert total control over the lives of its ci�zens. It is
characterised by strong central rule that a�empts to control and direct all aspects of individual life through
coercion and repression.

This Bill cannot be viewed as a balance on any level and therefore needs to be withdrawn.
