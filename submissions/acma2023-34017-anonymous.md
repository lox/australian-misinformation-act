# Submission re Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023

I am deeply concerned about the Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation
_Bill proposed by the Albanese Government. It’s intent seems more like something I might_
read in a dystopian novel, but certainly not in a bill presented for consideration by the
Albanese Government.
In my opinion, the proposed Bill is an unacceptable threat to freedom of speech and
democratic rights in Australia. Here are some of my reasons:

  - It gives unwarranted authority to the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) to decide what qualifies as ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’.
These are subjective definitions that seem to make them the arbiters of what is true
and acceptable and what is not.

  - This is unfair in that it gives the Government and mainstream media the freedom to
express their opinions while restricting what others may say or publish, which leaves
room for abuse of power.

  - It would suppress public debate and dissuade individuals and groups from presenting
diverse opinions and perspectives, hampering the vitality and creative potential of
Australia, e.g. tech companies could become tools of government censorship, thereby
stifling free speech and undermining the open exchange of ideas.

  - It goes against the principles of a democratic society, which needs freedom of
expression and diversity to thrive. In contrast, the Bill would strongly encourage
ideological conformity by paving the way for suppressing dissenting voices and
hindering independent thought.

I am strongly urging the Government to withdraw this Bill. As decreed by the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights:

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes_
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart_
_information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers’._
