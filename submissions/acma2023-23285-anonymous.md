I strongly oppose the proposed ACMA misinformation bill in all forms and further amendments. It
fundamentally removes people’s ability to express different and alternative views on whatever
platforms they choose.

The restriction on free speech and the dangers and downside risks this proposed bill results in, far
outweigh the downsides that come with free speech as it stands today. The positives for society,
democracy, free opinion, innovation, well rounded individuals, and well-rounded society all come
from free speech and voicing other opinions. Alternative voices will be pushed further underground
if this bill is to be implemented and will only confirm and ‘verify’ to others that so-called ‘conspiracy
theories’ etc. are true, and it will likely just verify their own thoughts. Australian society will operate
openly and honestly if we maintain the ability to express thoughts and opinion. Yes, there is some
incorrect free speech out there, but this needs to be an accepted risk to maintain free speech and
ability to voice opinions for all, in general.

It eradicates the freedom to express views other than what is presented in mainstream media, who
is cowed by only the information presented to them by the government, without further analysis,
verification, hard questioning, alternative views, or opinion. Mainstream media is no longer a twoway discussion in modern context and society. Mainstream media is manipulated, or at best, guided
in one direction only, which is why it is so important to maintain alternative views and opinions on
digital media platforms. It is not a decision of government or ACMA to decide what is ‘harmful’ or
inappropriate etc. providing it still within current laws and provisions of the digital platforms and
current laws.

Yes, ACMA will not have the (direct) power to “request specific content or posts be removed from
digital platform services”, however the implications of the laws that are proposed and the wording
of them, forces the digital providers to implement changes and algorithms on the system to comply
with the proposed laws – they have no other choice. ACMA has all the power, pending the wording
of the bill.

The proposed bill fundamentally rips apart Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
of which Australia was on the drafting committee and is now adopted by Australian Human Rights
Commission https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/commission-general/universal-declarationhuman-rights-human-rights-your-fingertips-human

**Article 19**

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers.
