### Introduction
I am writing to express my extreme concerns regarding the draft misinformation and
disinformation bill.

I am a year old female who experienced a severe adverse reaction to the Pfizer

Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine on 31[st] May 2021. On that date, my life suddenly
became coded as ‘disinformation’ by Australian government and social media
policies, and I still live with the dire consequences of the censorship of my medically
confirmed vaccine-induced illnesses to this day. I have been diagnosed with Chronic
Spontaneous Urticaria and an allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG) which is an
excipient of the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccination.

I am fully aware that misinformation and disinformation, broadly speaking, and in
very particular instances can have negative consequences for the community, and
therefore I do understand some of the well-meaning sentiments with which this
legislation has been written.

However, I am also well aware that the current practices of censorship are quite
literally disabling, indebting and abandoning my fellow Australians. Over the last two
years, censorship carried out by the media, educational institutions, social media and
digital platforms in response to government Covid policies have already caused me
extreme and ongoing harm as I attempt to obtain proper compensation, medical
information and care, treatment, and peer support as a vaccine-injured Australian.

Due to the censorship of emerging peer-reviewed scientific research and legitimate
investigative journalism on Covid vaccine harms, I have been prevented from finding
medical help and treatment. Furthermore, false claims provided to me by the
Government and medical community (for example that our reactions are ‘selflimiting’) have hindered proactive action by treating physicians, and have been
therefore damaging to public health.

Perhaps most alarmingly, in the context of receiving such limited assistance from the
Australian government and medical establishments, I have even been prevented
from sharing my personal story, and from gaining mental and peer support from my
social networks, because of social media censorship, again under the spurious claim
that my personal story would be damaging to public health.

The increase of, and normalisation of these powers, and the provision of additional
reserve powers, will not protect me and other vaccine-injured Australians from harm,
as the bill is intended. It will instead increase our vulnerability and harm our health,
which is in direct contradiction to the purpose of the bill.

**Initial Injury**

When I initially reacted to my Pfizer vaccination, despite Australia’s rollout lagging
behind the rest of the world, and thus ought to have been able to access
experiences and data from elsewhere, it was shocking to find a total lack of
information on government and public health websites, web searches, and social

media on what to do if you had a serious reaction, or what the array of symptoms
being experienced could be.

Eventually my symptoms were so severe, that my GP fast tracked my referral to an
Immunologist. However, the prescribed treatment by the Immunologist, failed to
provide any improvements in my health at all. Desperate in my need for help, I was
fortunate to source help from “natural remedies” through the care and concern of an
Integrative Practitioner who was willing and able to attempt to help me.

This significant and traumatic delay in accessing useful information about a lifechanging set of very serious symptoms meant a delay also in finding appropriate
medical treatment, which further delayed the commencement of treatment which
could have led to a better outcome for me in regards to long-term harms and
disablement I have experienced. The treatment options and appointments have been
extremely costly and with no government support, I have taken on significant
financial loss.

#### Uninformed medical staff

When medical treatment was sought, due to the censorship of any public discussion
of Covid vaccine adverse reactions, medical staff had no access to meaningful
guidelines about my illness and were unaware of how to identify my symptoms as a
Covid vaccine injury. In rare situations where they were able to recognise my
vaccine reaction as a serious issue, they did not know how to effectively treat me
due to a lack of information accessible to them.

Recently, in June 2023, I have continued to encounter issues with the Immunologist
at Hospital ( ), not being aware of the possibility of a PEG

allergy and not having the knowledge of the testing available for this. Luckily, the
Immunology at have a more up to date awareness of the issue

and have made testing accessible. If I had have settled for the initial clinical consult
at and did not continuing searching for answers, my health most

certainly would have suffered further due to the incompetence and lack of knowledge
of the practitioner at Hospital.

2 years on from the initial vaccination program, I would expect as a minimum,
consistency with up to date knowledge across the Health Care System.

To be clear, protocols for the treatment of Covid vaccine injuries were being
developed by doctors and researchers around the world at this time. However, they
were not being developed in Australia (and there are still no public, national,
accessible guidelines for GPs or patients about how to identify or treat medically
recognised Covid vaccine reaction outcomes).

#### Lack of government funded medical research

Trying to find treatment protocols that are based on research coming out of Australia
is impossible because government funded institutions will not conduct research into
vaccine injury for fear of losing credibility (and funding) by being labelled as

misinformation. The atmosphere of censorship that has been allowed to develop in
Australia because of the gagging of public debate around anything to do with Covid
vaccine harms, has had a direct effect on our scientific community, stifling their
ability to objectively investigate and examine adverse outcomes from Covid
vaccines.

For myself and my treating medical professionals this has meant we have had no
assistance from the Australian research community as we have sought to find
evidence-based testing and treatment options. This has prolonged my suffering and
worsened the long term impact on my health.

#### Trying to find support groups once injured

There are no government support groups, therapies, rehabilitation or even treatment
plans. I had to find these things myself, but again this has been incredibly difficult to
find because of the censorship on social media. People must talk in code about their
vaccine injury, and support groups are therefore very difficult to find, and in many
instances have been shut down by social media companies for the perverse reason
that discussion of very real and incredibly debilitating vaccine reactions was
somehow of harm to the community.

#### Trying to talk to family and friends about what has happened on social media and being censored 

Personal posts to family and friends, sharing news of what has happened to me, why
I was no longer working, why I was no longer able to go out socially, were censored.
Despite my story, and the similar stories of many thousands of other Australians,
being factual, social media and other media actors (including government
representatives) sought to silence my voice and the facts of my situation, causing
further harm and a significant amount of distress to myself and my family.

#### Government misinformation

Since critical public discussion of the Covid vaccines was censored, and only the
official “safe & effective” messaging was allowed to be shared online, known and
potential risks of these vaccines were suppressed, even though many were identified
long before governments officially recognised them (and today, there are still many
acknowledged adverse reactions that our governments have not told the public
about through its official channels).

This environment led me to believe that the vaccine would be safe for me, and that I
would be well looked after if something adverse happened. This has turned out not
to be the case, and the government along with social media actors are still
perpetuating misinformation about the real risks associated with these vaccines
leading to more Australians becoming seriously injured by them.

Censorship of all messaging other than official government claims of vaccine safety
is directly responsible for my decision to get vaccinated, which has caused me

significant harm. The government and social media organisations must take
responsibility for this harm, and any and all efforts that seek to ensure that this
environment continues will only ensure that more Australians will be harmed as a
direct result of this official misinformation.

### Conclusion & Recommendations
As previously stated, I am a vaccine-injured Australian. I am not interested in
receiving or sharing misinformation or disinformation, but within the current
framework of government controlled and tightly defined parameters regarding Covid
vaccine information, I have been abandoned and left to fend for myself.

If a situation such as my own, and that of other vaccine-injured Australians, can
occur within the current legislative and industry frameworks, surely this is a red flag
that further tightening of this legislation is only going to create more innocent and
unintended victims, not only on this issue but on any issue that authorities and
consensus groups determine they don’t want discussed in public.

**_It is my recommendation that all efforts (including this bill) that serve to_**
**_censor or hide unpopular views, regardless of perceived basis in fact or_**
**_consensus positions, be abandoned._**
