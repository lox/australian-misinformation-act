# Submission on Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023

## Zali Steggall OAM MP

I welcome the opportunity to make a submission to the Government on its proposed Communica�ons
Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.

I acknowledge that this Bill is an atempt by Government to address what is a very real and concerning
problem in modern Australian society, namely the prevalence of online content which, either
unwi�ngly or deliberately, contains inaccuracies, conflates opinion with “fact”, and in the more
sinister instances, seeks to deliberately misinform and mislead.

**Background**

The public are clearly concerned about this state of affairs. Some�mes incorrect or misleading content
is obvious, or quickly capable of being checked against other sources to establish its credibility, but to
con�nuously fact check all informa�on is clearly beyond the capability of the average ci�zen, and the
variability of online content contributes to a rising sense of scep�cism and disaffec�on in society.

There is substan�al evidence to assess that mis and disinforma�on is a significant issue that is facing
the Australian public. According to a Roy Morgan survey, over two-thirds of Australian adults have
been exposed to decep�ve news items.[1] Another study found that a quarter of a sample of Australian
adults had read stories that were ‘completely made up’.[2] More recently, The Australia Ins�tute’s exit
poll of the 2022 federal elec�on found that 73 per cent of Australians came across misleading poli�cal

adver�sements during the elec�on campaign.[3] In all these cases, the true figure may be higher, given
that research shows that the ability of consumers to dis�nguish fact from fic�on is much lower than
they realise.[4]

To make maters worse, there are perverse incen�ves in the informa�on market to produce false
poli�cal informa�on.[5] The poli�cal economy of social media erodes ‘both the media’s willingness to
supply “truth” in poli�cal discourse, and the consumer’s demand for it’.[6] There is a lucra�ve market to
produce fake news for consumers who naturally seek informa�on that confirms their exis�ng
prejudices.[7] The result is that misleading or decep�ve informa�on is highly transmissible.[8]

The Australian Compe��on and Consumer Commission’s _Digital Platforms Inquiry recommended_
beter regula�on of social media content to prevent misinforma�on and disinforma�on.4F[9] The current
_Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (2021) (DIGI Code) provides for_
voluntary self-regula�on by social media companies of the accuracy of content distributed through
their pla�orms.5F[10] However, the Code does not address the mater of misleading or decep�ve poli�cal
adver�sing because there is no current legal mechanism to underpin it in that regard. This exposure
dra� equally fails to deal with the issue of poli�cal adver�sing.

## Concerns with the Bill
The Government has already passed various pieces of legisla�on to address digital content which is
considered to pose an iden�fiable and serious threat or harm to society or certain members of society,
but I have real concerns about this proposed legisla�on on several counts.

My main concerns centre on three key areas, namely:

1. The necessity and appropriateness of the new powers and the capacity and appropriateness
of Australian Communica�ons and Media Authority (ACMA) to enforce them

2. Proposed changes to the defini�on of key terms

3. The exclusion of professional news content

### 1. The necessity and appropriateness of the new powers

**Are the new powers necessary or appropriate, or might they do more harm than good?**

The dra� Bill purports to give effect to certain recommenda�ons of the ACMA in its “Report to
government on the adequacy of digital pla�orms’ disinforma�on and news quality measures” dated
June 2021 (“ACMA Report”).

The main recommenda�ons it deals with are:

(a) Recommenda�on 3, which would give the ACMA formal informa�on-gathering powers
(including powers to make record-keeping rules) to oversee digital pla�orms, including the ability to
request Australia-specific data on the effec�veness of measures to address disinforma�on and
misinforma�on, and

(b) Recommenda�on 4, which would give the ACMA reserve powers to register industry codes,
enforce industry code compliance, and make standards for the ac�vi�es of digital pla�orms. These
powers would come with enforcement powers.

In this submission I will deal mainly with concerns about how the legisla�on deals with
Recommenda�on 4. I refer to how it deals with Recommenda�on 3 (which I have fewer concerns
about) in sec�on 4 below.

**How well is the ACMA performing its current role? Leaving aside whether the proposed new powers**
are on balance needed or appropriate, is the ACMA capable of exercising such new powers properly
and effec�vely?

I note that the recommenda�ons made in the ACMA Report could be seen as self-serving, in that they
operate to bestow further powers on ACMA, without providing for any oversight of the ACMA or
evalua�on of whether the ACMA is currently performing its func�ons in respect of broadcasters
adequately and appropriately.

As far as I am aware, there has been no recent evalua�on of the effec�veness of the ACMA in
performing its role vis-a-vis broadcasters. For reasons set out in my introductory paragraph, I do not
think it has performed well. In my view, before embarking on a course which would give this en�ty
broader powers, it should be subject to an external evalua�on to assess whether it is capable of doing
the job. I also note the comments in the VB Submission at p.5 on the difficulty of interpre�ng the
concepts of misinforma�on and disinforma�on, with which I concur.

_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

I note the submission of the Victorian Bar to the Law Council of Australia, on its view of the Exposure
Dra� of the Bill (“VB Submission”). I am persuaded that many of the points made in the VB Submission
have validity. In par�cular:

**(a)** **I am not at all convinced that the ACMA has the experience or capability to determine**
**whether content is “misinforma�on” or “disinforma�on” and therefore, whether the industry is**
**properly enforcing its own voluntary code.**

I am concerned to find out whether the voluntary codes are working. I note that at the �me of the
ACMA Report, the administra�ve func�ons had not been set up, meaning that a “compliance
subcommitee, a detailed repor�ng guideline and a facility to address signatory non-compliance" were
s�ll under development.

I consider that those parts of the Bill which enable the ACMA to gather informa�on and require recordkeeping would assist in establishing whether the voluntary codes are working.

To give effect to the reserve powers in this Bill without the informa�on required to assess the
performance of the voluntary codes is in my view, inappropriate.

However, I support in principle the informa�on gathering and record-keeping powers, which I consider
would assist in achieving this aim.

**(b)** **Given that the ACMA ul�mately reports to the Minister, and therefore to Government, the**
**powers given under the Bill are, I believe, capable of being misused should the poli�cal and social**
**environment enable this to happen and could be used in a way which threatens freedom of speech**
**and democracy.**

While the Government may be designing the system with the current poli�cal makeup in mind,
considera�on must be given to the poten�al for such powers to be misused by future governments.
The Bill provides for the poten�al for a new code to be imposed by ACMA in the event of
underperformance of the voluntary code.

**Recommenda�on**

**In addi�on to (and independently of) Government reconsidering the possibility for misuse or abuse**
**of these new powers by future governments with less benign agendas, I urge the Government in any**
**event to commission an independent external review of the performance of the ACMA in enforcing**
**its current powers, before pu�ng this legisla�on before Parliament. The poten�al for failure of this**
**legisla�on of this kind to achieve its intended outcomes will rest firmly on the ability of the ACMA**
**(or other enforcement body) to enforce it effec�vely and vigorously.**

### 2. Concerns about the defini�ons employed

I note that the DIGI Australian Code of Prac�ce on Disinforma�on and Misinforma�on, (“DIGI Code”)
which is the voluntary code and the focus of the ACMA report, acknowledges at page 7 that “online
disinforma�on and misinforma�on are rela�vely novel and dynamic phenomena and there is no
established consensus on the defini�on of either term.”

**The defini�ons in the Bill are very broad:**

(a) Misinforma�on is (summarised) informa�on that is false, misleading or decep�ve, and
reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

(b) Disinforma�on has a similar defini�on with the added element that the person dissemina�ng
it intends that it deceive another person.

There is also a detailed defini�on of “serious harm”.

**I note here a par�cularly important fact: that these defini�ons are quite different from the**
**defini�ons used in the DIGI Code.**

The defini�ons in the Code summarised below are:

(a) Misinforma�on is digital content that is verifiably false or misleading or decep�ve, the
dissemina�on of which is likely (but may not be clearly intended to) cause Harm.

(b) Disinforma�on is digital content that is verifiably false or misleading or decep�ve, is
propagated via Inauthen�c Behaviours, the dissemina�on of which is likely to cause Harm.

There follow defini�ons of both “Harm” and “Inauthen�c Behaviours”, which I will not go into here,
but I note that the defini�on of Harm is quite different from the defini�on of “serious harm” in the Bill,
and the Bill does not contain a concept of “Inauthen�c Behaviours”.

**I ques�on why Government proposes completely different defini�ons from those used in the DIGI**
**Code. Have the defini�ons in the Bill been tried in other jurisdic�ons, and if so, have they been**
**evaluated to determine whether they are effec�ve, or whether they cause unintended nega�ve**
**consequences?**

**If Government is seeking to implement the recommenda�ons of the ACMA Report, why has it**
**subs�tuted different defini�ons of such cri�cal terms?**

### 3. The exclusion of “professional news content”?

I have concerns about several limbs of the “Excluded Content” concept (including the exclusion of
content authorised by a government of any level) but I am par�cularly concerned that the powers do
not extend to enable monitoring “professional news content”.

I note that the defini�on of “professional news content” is detailed, but it is also very broad. It assumes
that bodies such as the Australian Press Council and the Independent Media Council have monitoring
and enforcement powers in place (and a corresponding track record) which would make it unnecessary
for the ACMA to monitor their codes. In fact, the Guidance Note at page 12 says that “the Australian
Government does not seek to influence the editorialisa�on and repor�ng by the free press”. However
professional news providers are not currently excluded from the ACMA’s current powers with respect
to broadcasters, and so I ques�on whether this represents a change in the posi�on of Government?

A par�cularly important effect of this exclusion would be that a broadcaster who would be subject the
ACMA’s monitoring and control under its current powers could simply transfer its content to a digital
pla�orm and thus escape scru�ny. This seems to be an obvious and glaring loophole.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while I agree that the issue of mis- and disinforma�on is an issue for Australia and the
global informa�on landscape that needs to be addressed, especially in the realm of social media, this
Bill as dra�ed requires significant improvement to:

a. adequately address the issue at hand and
b. put limits on the poten�al for abuse of power by future governments.

Without these improvements, I fear that the Bill will both fail to live up to the expecta�ons of
controlling misinforma�on and disinforma�on and have the poten�al to be exploited in the event of a
future extremist government.

I strongly recommend that an independent external review of the performance of the ACMA be
conducted before this Bill is presented to Parliament, to establish whether that body is the appropriate
body to entrust with any part of these novel and far-reaching powers.
