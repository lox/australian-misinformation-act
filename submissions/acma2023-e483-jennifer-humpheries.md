Dear government,

Please do not pass this proposed bill.

It is irrational to claim to “protect democracy” by imposing censorship and limiting free expression of personal
opinions and beliefs. This bill would put you in the same category as communist governments and other repressive
regimes in trying to impose uniformity on the thinking of the entire society. You would be attempting to force us all
to read only opinions that agreed with the government’s position, on everything. Do you really believe that the
government is infallible? That every current government policy and position is now and for all time true, perfect and
correct? That your government cannot make mistakes? Have you forgotten that all of you in government are human,
and therefore not perfect?

Please do not remove our right to free speech!

Kind regards,
Jennifer Humphreys
