**I object to the exposure draft of the Australian government’s Communications**
**Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**
**2023, which will threaten the very essence of our democratic rights, if enacted.**

I acknowledge the reasons behind why the bill was drafted in the first place but I do not
believe that the bill, in practice, will achieve what it has set out to do. I am concerned that the
bill’s response to keeping ‘Australians safe’ from misinformation and disinformation is
insufficiently sensitive to and protective of, freedom of expression and other privacy
interests.

Firstly, the bill gives extraordinary powers to ACMA which may lead to digital companies
censoring legitimately held views of Australian people to avoid hefty fines! I do not feel that it
is right to give so much power to ACMA, especially when the bill is problematic on it’s own
and terms like ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’, open to different interpretations and
therefore more likely to be abused by authorities. Furthermore, this overreach of power will
continually instil systematic fear in both the digital companies and the people to freely
express or publish their views which is the lifeblood of any democratic society!

I also believe that the bill will create a way for governments to directly or indirectly punish or
discriminate against those who speak out against them and therefore disadvantage
government critics in comparison to government supporters. It will create mistrust of
government and therefore lead to a very disruptive society.

While the government is trying to prevent ‘false’ information from spreading and hurting
average Australians, would it not be more rational to fight this information with information
and attempt to persuade rather than silence the voices of our people, the media etc.? It is
the freedom of speech and the freedom of expression that differentiates us from other
dictatorial governments in the world and is the lifeblood of our democracy so why disrupt
something that works well? In a healthy democratic society, people should be encouraged to
debate and say things without fear, censorship or penalties! It is what makes us stand out
from other authoritarian governments and gives the people of this country a ‘voice’ to
express their opinion, right or wrong! Therefore I feel that it is not at all clear that the bill is
required, considering there are many other ways and means to control online misinformation
without having to resort to undemocratic ways of dealing with this issue.

Furthermore, the terms ‘misinformation’ and disinformation’ are loosely defined. A doctor’s
report may be defined as ‘misinformation’ and censored because it does not satisfy certain
interest groups or opinions of a group of government officials. A journalist may be labelled as
the perpetrator of disinformation because an opinion was expressed that clashed with what
the government wanted us to believe at the time. And where does this stop? Or does it? The
bill, if enacted, will have a chilling effect on our freedoms of speech and expression and
nothing more than harm our people and society. It will not be in the interest of any
Australian, nor will it keep Australians ‘safe’ in any way. On the contrary, these loose
definitions of what is considered ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ will leave everything
open to interpretation and therefore open to abuse by authorities who may be able to use
this to their own advantage. This is not right and it does not serve the interests of our people,
nor does it keep Australians safe!

This bill, if enacted, will unnecessarily give overreaching powers to ACMA, restrict people’s
freedom of speech and freedom of expression and give digital companies more right to
censor information, information they fear will result in hefty fines! In fact, this bill has no place
in our democratic society as it’s a recipe for chaos, mistrust in our government and ACMA,
and a very dangerous route to keeping Australians safe. Any information that is false,


-----

deceptive or misleading should be fought with robust debate to better educate and inform
our society rather than take away the right of people to freely express their opinions. As
Albert Einstein once said, even ‘laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order
that every man may present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance in
the entire population.’
