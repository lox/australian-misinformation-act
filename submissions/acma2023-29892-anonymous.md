Dear Sir/Madam

**Submission: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023**

I am writing this submission to oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023._

I very much disapprove of the above Bill as it represents an attack on free speech, democracy and freedom of
conscience, and therefore by extension, is an attack on the Australian people.

Without free speech, people are both without a voice and a fundamental human right, but it appears this
Government would prefer Australians to be voiceless with the passing of this Bill. It is hypocritical to
propose such a Bill when the Government is promoting a “Voice” for the Indigenous people. This Bill goes
against Indigenous - and non-Indigenous people - and takes away a voice for all. It is contradictory and
downright ridiculous to propose the Voice to Parliament and this Bill at the same time, and therefore it is
self-evident that this is not about protecting people from “misinformation/disinformation.” This Bill is
nothing more than a thinly-disguised attempt to censor the Australian people, many of whom can no longer
trust the captured mainstream media, especially after they heavily promoted the experimental COVID jab as
“safe and effective” (that, it seems, was real misinformation/disinformation). Of course, the mainstream
media would be exempt from misinformation/disinformation under this proposed law, they being one of the
institutions whom the people should be able to rely upon for facts and truth.

I would like to ask a few questions which relate to this Bill:

1. On what basis will ACMA place themselves in the role of almighty God who is the sole arbiter of

truth?;

2. How can Australia have a government body that decides what is true/not true/harmful, when ACMA

is made up of fallible and biased human beings?;

3. What are ACMA's ties with industry?;
4. On what basis is the Government exempt? That situation is completely hypocritical and absurd; and

lastly,

5. Since when has Government been so concerned with “truth”?!

I doubt one could sufficiently answer the above questions, which therefore might reflect the true motives of
this Bill. It is quite clear to me and any reasonable person that this Bill is all about online censorship under
the guise of protecting the "safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and
_economy". This Bill is about suppressing the truth which goes against the globalist agenda and prevailing_
narrative of the day.

This Bill is tyrannical and goes far beyond what is reasonable. This is about the people bowing down to the
Government’s ‘truth’ alone. The Australian people don't want or need an Orwellian Ministry of Truth or the
Thought Police to tell people how to think and what to say. We don't need “Big Brother” deciding for us. We
are capable of discerning the truth for ourselves as responsible and reasonable adults and citizens of this
“democratic” nation.

Thank you for reading my submission.

Yours faithfully

Concerned Citizen
