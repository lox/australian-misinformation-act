They    - State & Federal    - to some degree dictated the flow of information during Covid. In hindsight, and based of
many reports post Covid this was incorrect. Freedom of information and differing ideas where shutdown or debunked
in a controlled information flow.
"They've" got away with it before there is Nothing YÂ« stopping a repeat. Who's to say "They" no best? There
politicians & controlled outlets that are mostly incapable of "free" thought and actions.

So in a word. NO

Ray
