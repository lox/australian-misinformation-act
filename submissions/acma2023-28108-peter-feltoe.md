## Executive Summary

This report describes adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reported to the Western
Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance (WAVSS) system for vaccinations received in 2021. The
format of this Annual Report differs significantly from previous WAVSS Annual Reports, to enable
description of the impact of the COVID-19 vaccination program, which was started in February
2021, on WAVSS and other aspects of the state’s vaccine surveillance program.

In 2021 a total of 5,756,723 vaccine doses were administered in WA, up from 2,071,167 in 2020.
Of this amount, 3,948,673 individual doses of COVID-19 vaccine were recorded in the Australian
Immunisation Register (AIR) as being administered to WA residents. The increase in vaccine
administration resulted in a significant increase in reports of AEFI, with WAVSS receiving 10,726
individual AEFI reports in 2021, up from 270 in 2020. Of these AEFI, 10,428 (97%) occurred after
a COVID-19 vaccine.

Although there was a notable increase in AEFI reports, rates of AEFI across the three COVID-19
vaccines administered in WA in 2021 were similar to national rates reported by the Therapeutic
Goods Administration (TGA)[1]. In WA, the total AEFI rate following a COVID-19 vaccine was 264.1
per 100,000 doses. The AEFI rate per brand was: Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) 306.1 per 100,000
doses, Comirnaty (Pfizer) 244.8 per 100,000 doses and Spikevax (Moderna) 281.4 per 100,000
doses.

These rates were compared to the WAVSS equivalent in the USA; the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS)[2]. In 2021 the national rate for AEFI following a COVID-19 vaccine
was 148.3 per 100,000 doses[3]. The AEFI rates for comparable vaccines in the VAERS program
were: Comirnaty (Pfizer) 122.0 per 100,000 doses and Spikevax (Moderna) 187.6 per 100,000
doses. While these AEFI rates are lower than in WA, this likely reflects differences in the
sensitivity of passive adverse event reporting systems between the two jurisdictions.

With the onset of the new COVID-19 vaccine program, WAVSS took an active role in identifying
potentially serious AEFI. Part of this role included regular collaboration with the TGA, and other
state immunisation programs. This report will provide an overview of some of the important AEFI
that have been specifically monitored as part of the TGA-coordinated national surveillance
vaccine safety program, including anaphylaxis, thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia syndrome
(TTS), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), myocarditis,
and pericarditis.

Vaccines routinely available on the National Immunisation Program Schedule, and influenza
vaccines, contributed 200 individual AEFI reports that were received by WAVSS. This number
was lower than the average number of reports received per year for the 2017 - 2020 time period
(mean = 275.8). There were 1,808,050 individual doses of non-COVID-19 vaccines recorded in
the AIR in 2021, giving a total AEFI rate of 11.1 events per 100,000 doses, which is similar to the
reported 2020 rate of 12.4 per 100,000 doses. Expected, minor reactions were common in these
reports.

In 2021, there were 1,125 appointments made at the adult vaccine safety clinic at Sir Charles
Gairdner Hospital, up from seven in 2020. There were 439 appointments made at the Perth
Children’s Hospital specialist immunisation clinic, up from 214 in 2020.

## 1. Background

This annual report of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in Western Australia (WA)
summarises surveillance data received by the Western Australia Vaccine Safety Surveillance
(WAVSS) system.[4]

This system is a WA Department of Health (the Department) initiative to monitor vaccine safety
that was established in March 2011, in collaboration with the Child and Adolescent Health Service
(CAHS) and the Central Immunisation Clinic. It was based on the Victorian Surveillance of
Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC) model. The system accepts
reports of suspected AEFI from health care providers and directly from the public, as well as
receiving reports through the active surveillance system administered by AusVaxSafety
(SmartVax) and reports received by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

Adverse events following immunisation are defined as unwanted or unexpected events following
the administration of a vaccine, which could be mild, such as a sore arm, or serious, such as
anaphylaxis. AEFI also include conditions that may occur following the incorrect handling or
administration of a vaccine. The fact that an adverse event occurred following immunisation is not
conclusive evidence that the event was caused by a vaccine. Factors such as medical history,
diagnostic testing, and other medication given near the time of vaccination must be examined to
help determine the likely cause of an adverse event. For serious AEFI, an assessment of causality
based on World Health Organization criteria[5] is undertaken by clinical and immunisation experts.

A serious AEFI (SAEFI) is defined[6] as an event that:

  - results in death

  - is life threatening

  - requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation

  - results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or

  - results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are medically significant events that have the potential
to be causally associated with a vaccine product and need to be carefully monitored. A list of
AESI for COVID-19 vaccines was determined by the Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines
and the Brighton Collaboration[7] (a global vaccine safety research network). This list was used in
addition to AEFI routinely monitored by WAVSS and the Department. Assessment of causality for
AESI was also undertaken using the World Health Organization criteria[5].

WAVSS has an important role in post-licensure surveillance of AEFI, which is essential to detect
uncommon events that may not have been identified in clinical trials undertaken for licensure of
vaccines. WAVSS receives reports by various reporting methods. Passive surveillance includes
reports submitted by the person who received the vaccine (the vaccinee) or on their behalf by a
health professional (including their immunisation provider), or family member. In WA, there is a
statutory requirement for health professionals to report any AEFI to the Department, per the
requirements of the Public Health Act 2016[8] and the Public Health Regulations 2017.[9] All AEFI
reports received by the Department are forwarded to the TGA within 48 hours. In addition, the
TGA may receive AEFI reports directly from clinicians, the public, and pharmaceutical companies
that manufacture vaccines. The TGA provides the Department with weekly data on all reports of

‘suspected’ AEFI that they receive for residents of WA. These reports are triaged to identify
serious AEFI and AESI, cross-checked with WAVSS reports, and entered into the WAVSS
database where missing. The TGA also provides the Department with daily reports of serious
AEFI so they can be entered into WAVSS immediately. Although passive reports of AEFI rarely
provide definitive evidence of a causal association between a vaccine and particular outcomes,
spontaneous AEFI reporting enables the early detection of signals that can then be more
rigorously investigated.

Active surveillance occurs via SmartVax[10] post-vaccination surveys that are distributed directly to
the person who received the vaccine with responses reported to the vaccine provider (e.g. general
practitioner, pharmacist) or directly to the Department for state run, mass-vaccination clinics.
SmartVax is installed in 137 sites (general practitioners, pharmacies and community health
clinics) across WA. For the COVID-19 vaccination program, surveys were sent on Day 3, 8 and
42 following vaccination, and reports of medically attended AEFI were reported to WAVSS. Some
SmartVax surveys from November and December 2021 were not reported to WAVSS following a
decision made in January 2022 to only report medically attended AEFI for adolescents, children,
booster doses, and new vaccines. De-identified, aggregated, national active surveillance data
from SmartVax is monitored by AusVaxSafety[11], which is an enhanced AEFI surveillance system
led by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS). In previous
years, actively identified adverse events were not included in WAVSS annual reports; however,
the number and importance of these reports due to the COVID-19 vaccination program warrant
further description. National active surveillance data can be found at https://ausvaxsafety.org.au.

In 2021, WAVSS was expanded to include potential AEFI reports identified through active
surveillance via data linkage. The Department has a well-established data linkage branch, with
data from over 100 million records from around 50 datasets linked. The COVID-19 Vaccination
Linked Data Repository (CVLDR) was established in April 2021; the CVLDR links individual
COVID-19 vaccination data in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) to emergency
department (ED) attendance, hospitalisation and death databases, for identification of potential
SAEFI or AESI associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Utilising data linkage mitigates the risk that
a healthcare provider or vaccine recipient does not report an AEFI which resulted in an ED or
hospital visit, and thus enhances the completeness of the surveillance system. The search criteria
for specific medical conditions were modified throughout the course of the COVID-19 vaccination
program based on findings from local, national and international vaccine safety surveillance
reports, and from the literature. Cases identified through data linkage active surveillance were
reviewed by clinicians for eligibility, and if identified as possible SAEFI, entered into the WAVSS
database.

In addition to the expansion of active surveillance to include data linkage, the vaccination
landscape in WA was significantly different in 2021 compared to previous years. The COVID-19
vaccination program commenced in late February 2021 and introduced three new vaccines over
the course of the year with different age groups becoming eligible for vaccination at different
timepoints (Figure 1). As a result, the number of vaccine doses administered in WA was
significantly higher than in previous years: 5,756,723 doses in 2021 compared to 2,071,167 doses
in 2020. Reporting of AEFI also increased significantly from 270 reports in 2020 to 10,628 reports
in 2021. In order to manage this substantial increase in workload, a Research Electronic Data
Capture (REDCap) project (a web platform for databases) was designed and implemented to
assist with triage of reports and case review. The COVID-19 vaccination program attracted
considerable public interest and media attention in 2021, almost certainly increasing public

awareness of vaccine safety. This increase in publicity may have contributed to increased
awareness of AEFI and increased reporting of COVID-19 vaccine AEFI to WAVSS.[12]

## 2. Method

For this annual report, AEFI reports were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if:

  - vaccination was recorded as ‘possibly’ being the cause of, or contributing to, the reported

adverse event. This includes reports where a determination is still pending; and

  - the residential address of the individual was recorded as Western Australia; and

  - the vaccination occurred between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021; and

  - the suspected reaction was captured in the state reporting system (WAVSS).

For COVID-19 vaccine AEFI reports:

  - AEFI reports were excluded if no vaccination date could be determined;

  - AEFI reports were excluded if the reporter provided two separate vaccine doses on separate

dates and the reaction-related vaccination date could not be determined;

  - AEFI reports were excluded if they were classified as ‘not related’; and

  - AEFI reports which reported separate reactions to different vaccines on different dates were

counted as separate reports.

**_Important considerations when interpreting the AEFI summary data_**

The reported symptoms, signs and diagnoses in each adverse event were temporally associated
with vaccination but are not necessarily causally associated with one or more of the vaccines
administered.

Young children often receive multiple vaccines as part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP)
schedule[13] during a single health care encounter. In these circumstances, it is usually not possible to
attribute a subsequent AEFI to a single vaccine, so all the vaccines administered during the visit are
usually listed as ‘suspected’ of involvement in the AEFI.

Limited information available in the AEFI reports received via the TGA may result in an inability to
identify the individual for follow-up or may preclude determination of whether an event was likely to
be causally related to vaccination.

Active surveillance data from SmartVax for all routine vaccines was reported to WAVSS based on
the immunisation provider’s decision to report the SmartVax survey response. For COVID-19
vaccination, SmartVax responses from vaccinees were entered into WAVSS if the vaccinee attended
an Emergency Department or was admitted to hospital; these were classified as ‘self-reported’. Some
SmartVax surveys from November and December 2021 were not reported to WAVSS following a
decision made in January 2022 to only report medically attended AEFI for adolescents, children,
booster doses, and new vaccines.

The data included in this report were received by WAVSS as of 14 July 2022 (for vaccinations
received in 2021) and are subject to change. This date was chosen as a cut-off to enable data
validation and timely reporting, and to capture longer-term AEFI. AEFI rates are calculated using the
number of doses of a particular vaccine recorded in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).

Unlike previous years, the AEFI summary is dominated by the large-scale, predominantly adult
COVID-19 vaccination program. The AEFI analysis is therefore broken down into:

  - Adverse events following routine vaccines, further separated into
```
     o Scheduled vaccines (includes all NIP childhood vaccines)
     o Influenza vaccines

```
  - Adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines

## 3. Overview

### 3.1. Summary of AEFI reports 
The number of AEFI reported to WAVSS was significantly higher in 2021 than in previous years (10,726 compared with an
average of 276 per year for the 2017-2020 period) due to the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccination program. To allow
comparison of AEFI numbers to previous years, Figure 2 presents all AEFI reported to WAVSS for persons vaccinated in 2021,
and Figure 3 excludes adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. The high number of reports in 2021 following COVID-19
vaccination reflects higher uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, and high engagement from the public and health care providers with
the monitoring of vaccine safety.

### 3.2. Characteristics of AEFI reports
Figure 4 illustrates how reports were received by WAVSS for vaccinations administered in 2021, as
passive surveillance (provider or public reports to WAVSS), active surveillance (reports from
SmartVax and data linkage). Despite the large difference in numbers of COVID-19 and routine
vaccine AEFI reports, the proportions from surveillance type were similar - 63% and 67% passive
surveillance, respectively, 35% and 33% active surveillance, respectively, and 2% data linkage for
COVID-19 vaccines.

_Figure 4. Proportion of adverse events following immunisation reported to WAVSS for vaccinations administered in_
_2021 by passive and active surveillance._

The characteristics of AEFI reports received from 2017-2021, including demographics of the vaccine
recipient, reporter details, and how the AEFI was managed, are presented in Table 1. To allow
comparison of AEFI to previous years, only passively reported AEFI are included for routine vaccines.
Both passive reporting and active reporting (including data linkage) are included for adverse events
following COVID-19 vaccination.

Despite an overall substantial increase in the number of AEFI reported to WAVSS, the number of
adverse events following routine vaccines was lower in 2021 than in any of the previous four years.
Consistent with previous years, and national-level data[14], more adverse events following routine
vaccines were reported for females than for males; however, this difference was most pronounced
for COVID-19 vaccine adverse events (64% female; Table 1). For adverse events following routine
vaccination, the distribution by age group was similar to previous years, with the majority (54%)
occurring in individuals under 18 years of age. The majority (81%) of adverse events following
COVID-19 vaccines occurred in the 18-64 years age group.

The reporting of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines differed from adverse events following
routine vaccines in that the majority (58%) were reported by the vaccinee or a family member,
whereas the majority (79%) of routine vaccine AEFI were reported by a healthcare provider (Table
1). In 2021, active surveillance in the form of SmartVax surveys accounted for 57% (3,506/6,083) of
the self-reported COVID-19 vaccine AEFI (Table 1). The proportion of AEFI with ED attendances
following COVID-19 vaccines was over double that of the 2017-2021 routine vaccine AEFI (48% vs
19-23%). This is predominantly due to the inclusion of active surveillance; previous years’ data did
not include SmartVax survey reports. Of the ED attended AEFI following COVID-19 vaccination, 62%
were actively identified via SmartVax surveys.

## 4. Routine vaccines

### 4.1 Passive surveillance of adverse events following scheduled vaccines

In previous WAVSS annual reports, AEFI have been separated into those following scheduled vaccination (predominantly the
childhood NIP vaccines) and those following influenza vaccination. This section includes a breakdown for these two groups for
the purposes of historic comparison, with AEFI following COVID-19 vaccines shown in section 5. There were 138 individual AEFI
reports received for persons vaccinated in 2021 that were assessed as events possibly related to immunisation from vaccines
other than influenza or COVID-19. The AEFI rate for this group of vaccines for 2021 was 14.7 per 100,000 compared to an
average of 16.2 per 100,000 between 2017-2020. Figure 5 presents number and rate of reports overall; figures broken down by
age group are provided in Appendix 1.

_Figure 5: Reports and rates (per 100,000 doses) of adverse events following scheduled immunisation, Western Australia 2017 to 2021, by month of_
_vaccination._


-----

From the 138 reports of AEFI following scheduled vaccinations, 174 reactions were reported. The
most common was injection site reaction (minor/common/expected) and the second most common
was rash (Figure 6).

_Figure 6: Rates of most frequently reported reactions following scheduled vaccination (any brand) in 2021_

The majority (80/138, 58%) of AEFI reports following scheduled vaccination were in those aged <5
years. Of the 80 AEFI for those aged <5 years, 108 reactions were reported. The most common
reactions were injection site reaction (minor/common/expected; 25.0%), rash (21.3%), and fever (3840°C; 6.5%). For vaccines on the childhood immunisation schedule[15], the overall rate of AEFI in
children <5 years recorded on the AIR is presented in Table 2. Pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine (Pneumovax 23) had the highest rate of AEFI reported (16.6 per 10,000 doses). This high
rate is possibly due to the small numbers of Pneumovax 23 administered; however, Pneumovax 23
is known to be associated with a high rate of injection site reactions[16]. The two DTPa-IPV vaccines
(Quadracel and Infanrix-IPV) had the next highest rates of AEFI (6.85 and 6.02 per 10,000 doses,
respectively). The rate of AEFI for all other vaccines was ≤ 3 per 10,000 doses. These rates are
within expected ranges based on previous years.

### 4.2 Passive surveillance of adverse events following Influenza vaccines

There were 62 individual AEFI reports received for persons vaccinated with an influenza vaccine in 2021 that were assessed as events possibly or
certainly related to vaccination (Figure 7), which is lower than the average of the last four years (n = 92). The pattern of AEFI over the year was
different than in previous years, likely related to a combination of earlier uptake of influenza vaccine and the poorer uptake of influenza vaccination
overall in 2021 compared to previous years (928,208 doses administered in 2021 compared to 1,138,091 in 2020). The overall rate of influenza
vaccine AEFI for 2021 was 6.7 per 100,000 doses.

_Figure 7: Reports and rates (per 100,000 doses) of adverse events following influenza immunisation, Western Australia 2017 to 2021, by month of vaccination_


-----

From the 62 reports following influenza vaccination, a total of 71 reactions were described, with
the most common reaction being injection site reaction (minor/common/expected), followed by
rash and lethargy (Figure 8).

_Figure 8: Rates of most frequently reported reactions following influenza vaccination (any brand) in 2021_

The majority (39/62, 63%) of AEFI reports related to influenza vaccination occurred in those
aged 18-64 years. This group also received the highest number of doses of influenza vaccine
(503,189/928,208, 54%). Only five AEFI following influenza vaccination were reported in
children aged <5 years in 2021. There were no seizures reported in this age group following
influenza vaccination, compared to two in 2020.

### 4.3 Active surveillance of adverse events following routine vaccines 

SmartVax is used for active surveillance following all routine vaccines; AEFI detected used
SmartVax are reported to WAVSS following assessment by the patient’s immunisation provider.

In 2021, 98 active surveillance reports following all routine vaccines were reported to WAVSS.
Of these, 66 (67.3%) were for children aged under five years, and 30 (30.1%) were for children
aged six to 17 years. The most common vaccines associated with a report were Infanrix hexa
(17 reports), Gardasil (15 reports) and Nimenrix (13 reports). The majority of these AEFI did
not require medical assessment; two patients attended an Emergency Department, and three
were assessed by a GP.

For the 98 actively identified AEFI reports, 255 reactions were reported. Active surveillance for
routine vaccination appears to solicit a greater number of reactions per event than passive
surveillance (2.6 reactions per report vs 1.2 for passive surveillance), likely because the active
surveillance survey prompts reporters to recall specific symptoms. The most commonly
reported reaction was lethargy (16.9% of all reported reactions), followed by fever (38-40°C;
11.4%), pain in limb (11.4%), and rash (10.2%).

## 5. COVID-19 vaccines

The following COVID-19 vaccine section presents integrated surveillance data which combine
passive surveillance (directly reported to WAVSS, including reports to TGA subsequently
entered to WAVSS), active surveillance (SmartVax surveys and data linkage). This report will
refer to each of the COVID-19 vaccines that were available and administered in WA in 2021 by
their brand names: Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Spikevax (Moderna).

### 5.1 Total count and rates of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines

There were 10,428 individual AEFI reports received for persons vaccinated with a COVID-19
vaccine in 2021 that were assessed as events possibly or certainly related to vaccination.
Overall, the rate of any COVID-19 vaccine AEFI in 2021 was 264.1 per 100,000 doses, which
is similar to the national rate reported by the TGA at the end of 2021 (approximately 230 per
100,000 doses)[17]. Figure 9 shows count and rate of AEFI by month of vaccination categorised
by brands Vaxzevria, Comirnaty or Spikevax. The overall rate of AEFI reports per brand was
306.1 per 100,000 doses of Vaxzevria, 281.4 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax, and 244.8 per
100,000 doses of Comirnaty.

_Figure 9 Count and rate (per 100,000 doses) of adverse events following immunisation following COVID-19_
_vaccines reported to WAVSS by vaccination date._

The vaccination month with the highest number of AEFI reports in 2021 was October (n=1,408),
which aligns with the commencement of expanded vaccine eligibility criteria for people aged
over 18 years, access to vaccination appointments without booking, and the announcement of
a vaccine mandate for the majority of WA workers (Figure 1). The rate of AEFI declined for all
brands over time, reflecting increased availability of vaccines, increases in vaccine doses
administered, changes to public messaging and Australian Technical Advisory Group on
Immunisation (ATAGI) recommendations following the detection of safety signals, and changes
in public and healthcare familiarity with AEFI (Figure 1).

### 5.2 Adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines by age group and brand

The rate of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines per 100,000 doses by age group and brand for 2021 is shown in

Table 3. This excludes Comirnaty age group 5-11 years and Vaxzevria age group 12-17 years, as all reported AEFI for these groups were vaccine
administration errors (i.e., administration outside recommendation). The highest AEFI rates were for people aged less than 60 years following
Vaxzevria, particularly for those aged 18-24 years (1,031.2 per 100,000 doses) and 40-49 years (1,006.4 per 100,000 doses).

### 5.3 Adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines by dose

AEFI reports where a vaccine dose number could be reasonably determined are presented in
Table 4. This does not include one AEFI reported for dose 4 and one AEFI for dose 6 (both
vaccine administration errors). The highest rate of AEFI was following dose 1 of Vaxzevria (495.1
per 100,000 doses) and dose 1 of Spikevax (355.4 per 100,000 doses). Comirnaty had similar
AEFI rates following dose 1 and 2 (250.6 and 257.3 per 100,000 doses respectively).

### 5.4 Reactions following COVID-19 vaccines

The 10,428 individual AEFI reports following COVID-19 vaccine for 2021 comprised of 28,211
reactions (a vaccinee may describe multiple AEFI reactions). In 2021, 64 types of adverse
reactions were described in 8,704 of the 10,428 reports. A summary of the most frequently
reported reactions that met established case definitions is shown in Figure 10.

_Figure 10. Rates of the five most frequently reported reactions following COVID-19 vaccination (any brand) in_
_2021._

A further 1,724 reports had an ‘other reaction’ listed that did not meet one of the 64 adverse
reaction types. The most common of these were dizziness (1.9 per 100,000 doses), shingles (1.5
per 100,000 doses), and tinnitus (1.5 per 100,000 doses).

### 5.5 COVID-19 vaccines – Adverse events of special interest 

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were monitored by the Department during the
COVID-19 vaccination program. AESI that warranted monitoring were determined following
expert clinical review by the Department of COVID-19 vaccine safety clinical trials, international
adverse event reporting, and AEFI reports to WAVSS. The AESI following COVID-19 vaccines
the Department identified as most prevalent during the 2021 rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination
program are described below.

**5.5.1 Anaphylaxis**

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, with onset
typically within minutes to hours[18].

The WAVSS system received 181 reports of possible anaphylaxis following COVID-19
vaccinations in 2021. The adult vaccine safety clinic at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital found
sufficient evidence to provide a diagnosis of anaphylaxis with a Brighton Collaboration Criteria
(BCC) of Level 1, 2 or 3[19] for 49 reports (

Table 6). Of the remaining 132 reports, 47 were reviewed by the adult vaccine safety clinic but
received a BCC Level 4 due to insufficient evidence to meet diagnostic certainty; 12 reports were
re-diagnosed as immediate allergic reaction; and 73 reports were awaiting clinic review at the
time the data were analysed. The rate of confirmed anaphylaxis cases was 1.0 per 100,000 doses

**5.5.2 Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome**

Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare but serious side effect of Vaxzevria
vaccine identified in 2021. This syndrome presents as blood clots (thrombosis) and low platelet
counts (thrombocytopenia), with formal diagnostic criteria established by the Thrombosis and
Haemostasis society of Australia and New Zealand[20]. It is also referred to as ‘vaccine-induced
immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia’ (VITT). Information obtained through local, national and
international surveillance databases during the COVID-19 vaccination program rollout found that
the risk of TTS appeared higher in people aged under 60 years of age. ATAGI issued a
preferential recommendation for Comirnaty to people under 60 years of age on 17th June 2021[21].

In 2021, 13 confirmed or probable cases of TTS following Vaxzevria (12 cases following dose 1,
one case following dose 2) were reported to WAVSS, resulting in a rate of 1.2 per 100,000 doses.
Counts and rates of TTS by age group are summarised in Table 7. In WA, the rate of TTS by age
group was 2.1 per 100,000 first doses for people aged less than 60 years of age, 2.1 per 100,000
first doses for people aged 60 years and over, and 0.2 per 100,000 second doses for people aged
60 years and over. National rates of TTS were 2 per 100,000 people vaccinated with Vaxzevria
aged 60 years or older and 2 to 3 per 100,000 people vaccinated with Vaxzevria under 60 years
of age[21].

**5.5.3 Immune thrombocytopenic purpura**

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system
attacks platelets in the blood and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow resulting in low platelet
counts, causing easy bruising and bleeding[22]. In 2021, 30 confirmed cases of ITP were reported
to WAVSS following COVID-19 vaccinations. The rate of ITP was 2.4 per 100,000 doses of
Vaxzevria, 0.1 per 100,000 doses of Comirnaty, and 1.0 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax. One
report of ITP following dose 1 of Vaxzevria resulted in death, and this was confirmed to be linked
to their immunisation as determined by the Vaccine Safety Investigation Group authorised by the
TGA[23]. The TGA reported a national rate of ITP following Vaxzevria vaccination of <1 per 100,000
but has not provided a rate of ITP following Comirnaty or SpikeVax[17].

**5.5.4 Guillain-Barré syndrome**

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare but sometimes serious immune disorder when nerves
are attacked by immune cells resulting in pain, numbness, muscles weakness and/or difficulty
walking[17].

In 2021, WAVSS had 14 confirmed cases of GBS following Vaxzevria and Comirnaty COVID-19
vaccinations. Counts and rates of GBS by brand and dose are summarised in Table 9. The rate
of GBS was 0.8 per 100,000 doses of Vaxzevria, and 0.2 per 100,000 doses of Comirnaty. The
TGA reported the national rate of GBS was 1 per 100,000 people vaccinated with Vaxzevria[17].
The TGA has not reported a national rate of GBS following Comirnaty.

**5.5.5 Myocarditis, myopericarditis and pericarditis**

Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium
(the thin, sac-like tissue surrounding the heart muscle)[24]. Myocarditis and pericarditis can occur
together or separately. When they occur together it is called myopericarditis. Symptoms for
myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis can include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of
breath, abnormal heart beats, fainting, or pain when breathing[24]. Diagnostic criteria for
myocarditis, myopericarditis, and pericarditis have been established by both the United States
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[25] and the Brighton Collaboration[26]. Both these
classification systems have been applied to cases of possible myocarditis, myopericarditis, and
pericarditis that have been reported to WAVSS. For this report, myopericarditis has been grouped
together with myocarditis due to its clinical severity, and similar management approach postvaccination.

In 2021, 138 confirmed cases of myocarditis/myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccinations
were reported to WAVSS. Counts and rates of myocarditis/myopericarditis by brand and dose are
summarised in Table 10. The rate of myocarditis/myopericarditis was 0.4 per 100,000 doses of
Vaxzevria, 4.5 per 100,000 doses of Comirnaty, and 7.3 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax.
Myocarditis/myopericarditis following second dose Spikevax was more than twice the rate of
myocarditis/myopericarditis following second dose Comirnaty.

The TGA reported rates of myocarditis/myopericarditis were 1.5 per 100,000 doses of Comirnaty,
and 2.2 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax[17]. The TGA has not reported a national rate of myocarditis
or myopericarditis following Vaxzevria and reports confirmed cases of myocarditis following
internal clinical review.

100,000 doses), 50-59 years (10.2 per 100,000 doses) and 12-17 years (9.2 per 100,000 doses).
The highest myocarditis/myopericarditis rate following Comirnaty were age groups 18-24 years
(11.6 per 100,000 doses) and 12-17 years (6.1 per 100,000 doses). Rates of
myocarditis/myopericarditis following Vaxzevria by age group were less than 1 per 100,000
doses.

A total of 365 confirmed cases of pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccinations received in 2021
were reported to WAVSS. Counts and rates of pericarditis by brand and dose are summarised in
Table 11. The rate of pericarditis was 1.4 per 100,000 doses of Vaxzevria, and 11.9 per 100,000
doses of Comirnaty, and 18.4 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax. Pericarditis following first and third
dose Spikevax was 1.7 times the rate of pericarditis following first and third dose Comirnaty, and
pericarditis following second dose Spikevax was 1.4 times the rate of pericarditis following second
dose Comirnaty.

National pericarditis rates reported by the TGA were 7.1 per 100,000 doses of Comirnaty, and
8.6 per 100,000 doses of Spikevax[17]. The TGA has not reported a national rate of pericarditis
following Vaxzevria and reports confirmed cases of pericarditis following internal clinical review.

### 5.6 COVID-19 active surveillance - data linkage

In 2021, 230 possible AEFI following COVID-19 vaccinations that had not already been reported
to WAVSS were identified using the newly established data linkage active surveillance system.
AEFI types identified by data linkage are shown in Table 13 and Appendix 3. Additionally, data
linkage identified 40 deaths that occurred within a 21-day window following COVID-19 vaccination
and these were reviewed and determined to be not related to vaccination.

## 6. Specialist clinic activity (all vaccines)

### 6.1. Referrals following COVID-19 vaccine AEFI

A total of 1,200 WAVSS reports following COVID-19 vaccination resulted in a referral to a
specialist clinic. Of these, 1,168 (97%) were referred to the adult vaccine safety clinic at Sir
Charles Gairdner Hospital, 29 (2%) were referred to the paediatric specialist immunisation clinic
(SIC) at Perth Children’s Hospital, and three to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Haematology
Department.

### 6.2. Adult clinic activity

In 2021, there were 1,125 appointments made at the adult vaccine safety clinic at Sir Charles
Gairdner Hospital. Appointments include referrals from non-WAVSS sources, and one patient can
have multiple appointments.

Most of the referrals were related to COVID-19 vaccination queries in relation to previous adverse
events following immunisation, with a small number (~20) due to complex, medically at-risk cases.
By comparison, there were seven adults referred for specialist immunisation care at Sir Charles
Gairdner Hospital in 2020.

### 6.3. Child and adolescent clinic activity

In 2021, there were 439 appointments made at the Perth Children’s Hospital SIC, of which 292
were new referrals. As with the adult clinic, children may attend multiple appointments over the
year and referrals can be received from sources outside the WAVSS referral service. In total 300
individual children and adolescents attended the SIC and 83 did not attend their appointment. Of
those who attended their appointment, 42 (13.7%) were due to possible AEFI, 116 (37.8%) for
complex medically-at-risk immunisation requirements, 45 (14.7%) for vaccine hesitancy, 65
(21.1%) for needle phobia and 39 (12.7%) for other immunisation reasons.

This represents a 173% increase in referrals to the Paediatric SIC from 2020, and a 40% increase
in appointments.

## 7. WA Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee (WAVSAC) 

In previous years, Western Australia’s Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee (WAVSAC) met twice
a year to review state vaccine safety. In 2021, this Committee held additional meetings and then
continued meeting weekly to review the vaccine safety from the WA COVID-19 vaccination
program. The committee met 31 times in 2021. In May 2021, WAVSAC convened a specialist
sub-group, the Expert Clinical Review Group (ECRG), to individually review WAVSS reports
which required specialist assessment. The ECRG met 34 times in 2021 and reviewed 849
WAVSS reports.


-----

## 8. Discussion

In 2021, WAVSS provided robust and timely vaccine safety surveillance for all vaccines
administered in WA. Building on existing capabilities, WAVSS expanded significantly,
demonstrating agility in response to a change in the vaccination landscape and highlighting the
sound vaccine safety surveillance methods already employed.

### 8.1. Vaccine safety surveillance results

A summary of the number of vaccines administered in 2021, the number of adverse events
reported, and the rates of adverse events is provided in Table 14.

_Table 14: Numbers of vaccines administered, and adverse events reported, with rate of adverse events, for non_
_COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, 2021._

Vaccine type Number of vaccines Number of adverse Rate of adverse

administered in 2021 events reported to events per 100,000

WAVSS doses

Non COVID-19 1,808,050 200 11.1

COVID-19 3,948,673 10,428 264.1

The surveillance of routine vaccines was a small – albeit important – component of the WAVSS
workload. This report demonstrates that vaccination with scheduled and influenza vaccines
continues to be safe, with little change in AEFI rates compared to previous years, and with most
reactions being minor, with minimal impact on vaccine recipients. Confidence in the surveillance
and safety of vaccines was further strengthened by the inclusion of active surveillance data in
2021.

The most common AEFI reported for COVID-19 and routine vaccinations were similar; headache,
lethargy, myalgia and fever, with the exception of chest pain following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

The high number of reports following COVID-19 vaccination reflects high engagement from the
public and health care providers with the monitoring of vaccine safety. The volume of reports
allowed rigorous investigation of adverse events. In combination with national and international
data, monitoring of AEFSI by WAVSS (e.g. TTS, myocarditis) affected the recommendations by
TGA and ATAGI to provide a safer program.

### 8.2. Changes to WAVSS in 2021

Prior to 2021, WAVSS had already established sound methods for identifying potential AEFI, that
provided an essential basis for monitoring the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the
considerable increase in volume of AEFI reports received by WAVSS following the introduction
of the COVID-19 vaccination program, several WAVSS processes were added to/expanded in
2021 including:

  - Direct reporting of AEFI from WAVSS to the TGA. This contributed to national decisions,

for example, when reports of TTS following Vaxzevria contributed to changes in ATAGI
recommendations for age groups eligible to receive this vaccine.

  - Inclusion of reports from SmartVax. SmartVax provided a multi-day survey (on days 3, 8

and 42 post-vaccination) to COVID-19 vaccinees promoting the use of active surveillance
in addition to passive surveillance for members of the public. This service enabled longer
term safety signals to be detected.

|Vaccine type|Number of vaccines administered in 2021|Number of adverse events reported to WAVSS|Rate of adverse events per 100,000 doses|
|---|---|---|---|
|Non COVID-19|1,808,050|200|11.1|
|COVID-19|3,948,673|10,428|264.1|


-----

  - Referrals to the adult vaccine safety clinic. The capacity of the adult clinic increased

significantly in 2021 and was an essential service provided during the COVID-19
vaccination program.

Additionally, changes to vaccine safety surveillance at the Department were introduced in 2021
to manage the exponential increase in AEFI reports including:

  - A COVID-19 vaccine safety team was established as part of the vaccination program to:
```
     o review, enter and validate AEFI reports, 
     o manage a REDCap support project designed and implemented to assist WAVSS

```
workflow,
```
     o support the WA Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee (WAVSAC) and sub-group

```
Expert Clinical Review Group (ECRG).

  - The establishment of the ECRG provided clinical oversight of AEFI through individual case

review by a group of specialist consultants. The ECRG has continued into 2022 and has
been identified as providing an essential service for future vaccine safety surveillance.

  - A new data linkage system was established in 2021 as part of the active surveillance for

COVID-19 vaccines which proved useful in identifying adverse events of special interest
that had otherwise not been reported to WAVSS. Data linkage for non-COVID-19 vaccine
safety is intended to be used by the Department in the future.

  - AusVaxSafety and the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance

(NCIRS) established a national follow up of TTS and myocarditis following COVID-19
vaccination. De-identified cases in WAVSS have been included in this important study,
made possible through ethics and governance approval through the Department, and
expanded capacity of WAVSS staff, enabling essential follow up of WA participants.
