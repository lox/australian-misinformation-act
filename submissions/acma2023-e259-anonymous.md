As a 4th generation Australia, who was brought up with free speech and debate, I really abhor the attitude taken by government
and the general media - we are expected to swallow the most horrendous lies and disinformation, that they turn around in 0rder
to blame us - it is very un-Australian!

This regulation must be stopped and stopped for all time - it is totally against the principle of democracy, free thinking and free
speech, all of which made our country so wonderful (until recently).

How dare you even think of wrecking this wonderful country, a country to which so many other nationalities want to come.
