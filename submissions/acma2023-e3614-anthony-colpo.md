#### From Anthony Colpo anthonycolpo@hotmail.com

 Submission begins after the broken line below and can be made public.

The Australian Federal Government seeks to introduce draconian and dystopian new legislation to stifle free speech,
##### allegedly in the name of combating "misinformation" and "disinformation".

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 purports _"to_
##### hold digital platform services to account and create transparency around their efforts in responding to misinformation and disinformation in Australia."

That's the official line. The reality is that this bill is designed to give the government totalitarian powers to crush
freedom of speech.

The draft bill states _"digital_ _platform_ _provider_ _means_ _a_ _person_ _who_ _provides_ _a_ _digital_ _platform_ _service,"_ which casts a
##### very wide net.

The _"harm"_ this bill purports to prevent includes any of the following:

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation,
age, religion or physical or mental disability;

(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;

(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government
institutions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians;

(e) harm to the Australian environment;

(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy

In regards to (a), we already have federal anti-discrimination and hate speech laws purporting to prevent offense to
minority groups. Namely, _the_ _Age_ _Discrimination_ _Act_ _2004,_ _Australian_ _Human_ _Rights_ _Commission_ _Act_ _1986,_ _Disability_
##### Discrimination Act 1992, Racial Discrimination Act 1975, and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.

Based on the self-serving behaviour of both Commonwealth and State governments to date, the true meaning of (b)
and (c) can be fairly construed as anything that threatens the government and its agendas. When governments act
against their people, then it is the democratic right of citizens to object and protest. This new bill endows government
with the power to squash dissent, no matter how calm, reasoned and non-violent.

##### of multinational corporations (many of whom pay zero corporate tax, while Australians struggle with an endless array of taxes, fees, fines, levies, rates and worsening cost of living pressures).

Governments, along with their mainstream media allies, are also by far the biggest disseminators of misinformation
and disinformation in the country.

Which, of course, is why the government has conveniently exempted itself from having to abide by the new laws. _"[T]h_
e _Commonwealth",_ _"a_ _State",_ _"a_ _Territory"are_ all exempted from having to abide by the censorship laws they intend to
impose on the public they are supposed to serve.

Other content exempted by the draconian new bill includes that emanating from _"a_ _foreign_ _government_ _ora_ _body_
##### recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor of educational institutions."

So under this new law, powerful foreign entities that already hold sway over Australia, such as the US and China, will
##### qualify for free speech privileges denied to ordinary Australians.

This all raises the question of just what qualifies government as the ultimate arbiter of truth.

What is government, exactly?

In Australia, government includes people who masturbate on each other's desks, and are so proud of doing so that
##### they film and share their handiwork - only to later complain they are the victim of 'revenge porn' (see: https://www.abc. net.au/news/2021-04-29/police-report-made-over-desk-masturbation-scandal/100105650).

Government in Australia includes people who use the Parliament House chapel to engage in sex acts with their
##### similarly depraved colleagues and prostitutes (see: https://7news.com.au/politics/federal-politics/qraphic-imaqes-of-se x-acts-inside-parliament-house-leaked-c-2407876).

Australian Government features people like Scott Morrison, who _â€œallowed_ _cabinet_ _to_ _be_ _misled"_ _on_ the legality of the
##### Centrelink Robodebt scheme. In other words, he was well aware the scheme, which triggered over 2,000 suicides,
was illegal (see: [https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/politics/australian-politics/2023/08/08/push-refer-ex-pm-morrison-ro](https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/politics/australian-politics/2023/08/08/push-refer-ex-pm-morrison-ro)

notice/10821272).

The current pinnacle of Australian Government is one Anthony Albanese, whose ruling party is behind this draconian
new anti-free speech bill. When asked by 3AW host Neil Mitchell recently what he would do if he held dictator-like
powers (something Albanese is clearly working on with this bill), the PM's answer was highly revealing. Albanese
replied he would use his new iron fist     - not to stamp out corruption nor to increase the notoriously lenient sentences
given to sex offenders here in Australia     - but to ban social media. Albanese, the man with unlimited propaganda funds
at his disposal and who hides behind a team of staffers and security personnel, said he hated _"keyboard_ _warriors"_ _bee_
ause they wrote things he claims they would never say to his face (see: [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1241](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1241)

##### 1539/Anthony-Albanese-dictator-ban-social-media-abolish-states.html).

If Albanese were honest, he would admit it is because they write things he cannot refute without getting angry and
resorting to petulant name-calling. Witness his recent dismissal of _"Voice"skeptics_     - which, according to polling, is a
majority of Australians     - as _"Qanon"_ conspiracy theorists (see: [https://youtu.be/yA-4hmQsJYM).](https://youtu.be/yA-4hmQsJYM)

##### colpo.substack.com/p/australian-pm-anthony-albanese-photographed).

Is it not a huge conflict of interest for a man who would no doubt prefer this incident to remain buried to be introducing
legislation that allows him and his party to determine what qualifies as _"misinformation"_ _and_ _"disinformation"?_

As stated earlier, the government itself is a massive source of egregious _"misinformation"_ and _"disinformation"._ Throu
ghout the COVID 'pandemic', for example, both Federal and State governments lied through their teeth.

We were repeatedly told we were in the midst of a deadly pandemic, which was complete nonsense. Mortality was in
##### fact tower than average during 2020, prior to the introduction of the gene therapies the government misleadingly
described as 'vaccines'. The average age of a so-called 'COVID' death throughout the 'pandemic' was 86     - two years
##### higherthan the national average! (See: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-at-a-gl ance-13-may-2021).

Well before the gene therapy rollout commenced, renowned Stanford researcher John P A loannidis had already
analyzed data from around the globe and reported an infection fatality rate of only 0.27%. In people younger than 70
years, the median infection fatality rate was 0.05% (see: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7947934/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7947934/)

Despite the near 100% survival rate, our Federal and State governments vigorously pushed the lie that COVID was a
deadly threat and that we needed to take 'vaccines' to protect ourselves and others. So much so, that they imposed
draconian mandates that forced people to either get injected or lose their job (which for some people would literally
have meant losing their home).

To justify this cruel medical tyranny, Federal and State governments incessantly told us the 'vaccines' were _"safe",_
_"effective"_ and _"thoroughly_ _tested"._ They were blatantly lying on all counts.

An impartial examination of the clinical trial data showed the vaccines were not effective, and that the _"95%_ _effective"f_
igure widely cited for the Pfizer drug was a misleading relative risk figure that diminished to a pathetic 0.84% when
considered in absolute terms (see: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fullte](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fullte)
xt#%20)

And far from being the lifesavers they were widely promoted as by government, the Pfizer clinical trial in fact showed
a higher death rate in the 'vaccine' group (see page 23 of: [https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download).](https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download)

Little surprise then, that after the low mortality of 2020, the rollout of the gene therapies was accompanied by a
striking increase in mortality.

In 2022 in Australia, there were 25,235 (15.3%) more deaths than the historical average (see: [https://www.abs.gov.au](https://www.abs.gov.au)

/statist! cs/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/jan-dec-2022).

In 2023, up to 30 April, there were 6,220 deaths (12.3%) more than the baseline average (see: [https://www.abs.gov.a](https://www.abs.gov.a)
##### u/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/latest-release).

Natural variations in annual mortality are in the order of 1-2%; a massive annual jump of 12-15% is seismic.

According to the Actuaries Institute, it's something Australia has not seen since World War II (see: [https://www.smh.co](https://www.smh.co)

occurred after the 'vaccine' rollout (see: [https://www.reignitedemocracyaustralia.com.au/opposed/).](https://www.reignitedemocracyaustralia.com.au/opposed/)

The government clearly lied to us about the COVID gene therapies, and it lied to us about other useless interventions
like masks. In fact, it is still doing so. The Commonwealth government, in a textbook classic display of misinformation,
claims _"Wearing_ _a_ _face_ _mask_ _can_ _help_ _protect_ _you_ _and_ _those_ _around_ _you._ _Face_ _masks_ _stop_ _viruses_ _from_ _spreading_
_through_ _the_ _air._ _This_ _means_ _you_ _are_ _less_ _likely_ _to_ _catch_ _or_ _spread_ _the_ _virus"_ (see: [https://www.health.qov.au/topics/cov](https://www.health.qov.au/topics/cov)
##### id-19/protect-yourself-and-others).

Face masks have _never_ been shown under anything resembling controlled conditions to prevent respiratory
infections, as a recent review by the esteemed Cochrane database reported (see: [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cd](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cd)
##### sr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full).

Nothing I have stated above is _"misinformation",_ _"disinformation"or_ the rantings of _"conspiracy_ _theorists"-_ almost all
the COVID-related hyperlinks I have included link either to peer-reviewed studies, the Commonwealth government's
own statistics or US FDA documentation. Yet as Federal and State government behaviour during the 'pandemic'
showed, this is exactly the type of factual information governments, and the social media companies they alternately
shower with threats and money, seek to suppress. The new anti-free speech legislation will grant the federal
##### government more power than ever to do so.

In summary, government is comprised of dishonest, degenerate characters with scant regard for the facts. Needless
to say, these are people who have absolutely no place claiming to be the arbiter of what is true and false.

The way to attack bad information is with good information, with unassailable facts and superior logic. Resorting to
censorship is a dead giveaway that the government does not possess either of the latter attributes. It must instead
silence its opponents and critics by weaponizing the law against them.

If the government was truly serious about protecting the public from harm arising from bad information, it would
immediately act against the ongoing sexualization of young children. Instead, we see the government stand idly by
##### while major outlets like Big W have marketed books featuring explicit descriptions of sexual acts to young kids.

In short, this is a self-serving bill clearly designed to suppress dissent and criticism of the government, disingenuously
marketed as a war against harmful information in the name of the public good.
