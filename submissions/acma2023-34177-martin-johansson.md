Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe that this bill

undermines the freedom of speech and restricts the power of regular people in our

democracy.

The bill creates a distinct division between different classes of citizens, with
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions given the power to

spread information, whether true or false. This diminishes the voice and knowledge
# of regular citizens who often possess deep industry insights and expertise. The
Internet has been a powerful tool for democratic participation, empowering ordinary

people to share their thoughts and engage in meaningful discussions. However, this
law threatens to disproportionately harm regular citizens.

The excessive fines imposed by the bill will lead to digital services becoming more
restrictive with speech than ever before. Rather than providing relief or protection,
the bill applies across the entire industry without any provisions for accountability or

review. This broad application without escape valves will stifle free expression and
obstruct open and honest discussions.

Furthermore, the task of accurately discerning what is true or false is an impossible
one. The nature of knowledge and information constantly evolves, and what was


-----

once considered factual can be disproven later. History has shown us numerous

instances where experts and authorities have presented incorrect information, only
# to be later proven wrong.

For instance, claims regarding mask efficacy, COVID-19 transmission, and vaccination

effectiveness have evolved overtime. Under the proposed legislation, these
statements could be deemed as public health-harming misinformation. It is essential
# to recognize that freedom of speech allows for open debates, where people can be
wrong, and truth can be discovered through collective discussion and critical
thinking.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has

expressed serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill, highlighting
the challenges of implementation and the potential for unintended consequences.

The bill's focus on larger platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter fails to
consider the broader implications. Thousands of community websites not covered by
the original intent will be inadvertently impacted due to the bill's broad definitions.

This disregard for smaller platforms and websites, created by individuals or small

enterprises, imposes unreasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and enterprise.

Moreover, the bill's extraterritorial reach extends Australian law disproportionately
onto foreign entities, creating uncertainty and limiting legitimate global internet

access. It places unrealistic expectations on foreign digital service providers who lack
knowledge and membership in Australian industry bodies.

To illustrate, imagine if China required Australian websites to comply with its dictates
on the Tiananmen Square massacre. The Australian government would rightfully
oppose such infringement on freedom of speech. Applying the same principle, we
should not impose similar restrictions on foreign digital services.

It is concerning that the Australian government has recently shown concern and
opposition to extraterritorial actions by other countries, such as the Hong Kong
government charging Hong Kong activists residing in Australia. We should not
engage in practices that we criticize, as it undermines our credibility and democratic

values.

The proposed bill contradicts the News Media Bargaining Code (NMBC) enacted in

2021, limiting digital services' ability to address misinformation and disinformation.

The NMBC forces digital services to remove global content from non-eligible news
organizations, hindering the availability of alternative viewpoints. This contradiction
# further highlights the flaws and inconsistencies within this proposed legislation.

This bill erodes the principles of democracy, marginalizes minority voices, and
restricts the free flow of information necessary for an informed electorate. It
delegitimizes the viewpoints and experiences of regular Australians, treating them as
untrustworthy compared to government-accredited sources.

The threats and pressures imposed on digital platform providers and ordinary

citizens only exacerbate this alarming situation. The potential for reputational

damage, financial penalties, and interference with personal lives creates a climate of

fear, discouraging open dialogue and critical thinking.

The principles of freedom of thought, conscience, and expression are enshrined in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia is a signatory. By
stifling diverse viewpoints, this bill contradicts these fundamental rights and
undermines the very essence of democracy.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communications, and the Arts to reconsider and withdraw the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is imperative to protect and uphold freedom of speech,
foster open and honest discussions, and respect the power of ordinary citizens in our

democracy.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will give due importance

and attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Martrin Johansson
