# ACMA Amendments


# I do not support these proposed Amendments in any way.


# ACMA should not be the arbiter of what is mis or dis-information the Government has been the leading purveyor of both.

 A Government or Government agency which is a centralised authority who determines what is true or false is a dictatorship (Government will be your sole source of TRUTH). One only has to look at the North Korea example to see the effects and repurcussions of government controlled speech.

 In a free and democratic society we must have the freedom to have open and frank discussion, opinion and expression in any media that is available even if that opinion does not agree with someone else and even if the whole discussion does not have absolute facts.  These proposed amendments are truly censorious and censorship stifles robust discussion.

 Government has been the purveyor of information that has been proven incorrect with specific reference to Covid-19. If these censorious amendments are carried out then no challenge to disinformation or misinformation given by the Government and it’s agencies or the media influencers can be made. Again, this becomes a dictatorship just like the North Korean example. Do politicians want Australia to be compared to North Korea (NK)? Australians will be living under the same dictatorship and oppressive rules as that of the NK regime.

 Conspiracy theories exist because Government does not tell the whole truth and individuals are left searching for truth and making appropriate decisions for themselves which is the foundation of a democratic society. Many “Conspiracy theories” have been proven to be true over time, including those related to Covid-19 due to the propaganda put out by the government and the mainstream-controlled media (controlled by the pharmaceutical companies).

 Government is not consistent in investigating fully and at times do not convey all the facts either (as noted by Uluru Statement from the Heart

# These amendments are dangerous for everyone (apart from Parliament, ACMA and any other exempt bodies or groups) and I vehemently object to the amendments in every way.
