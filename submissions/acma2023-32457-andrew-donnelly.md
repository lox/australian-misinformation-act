To be published.

To whom it may concern,

I am totally opposed to the so-called Misinformation Bill now before federal
Parliament.

The reason for this Bill is entirely to protect the status quo and has nothing to do with
the public good and is a gross violation of my God-given right to free speech.

I am suspicious because of the what is in the Bill itself as well as the way the
Government has presented the case for the Bill, as on this pagehttps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/new-acma-powers-combatmisinformation-and-disinformation, with its links to the Exposure Draft, the
**_Guidance Note and the Fact Sheet-_**
https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/communicationslegislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformation-bill2023, https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/communicati
ons-legislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformation-bill-2023guidance,and https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/com
munications-legislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformationbill-2023-fact .

This submission will argue this by reference to these documents. I shall argue that
the Government is being forthcoming about neither the contents of this Bill nor its
aims and objectives. This submission will discuss what I regard as attempts to
mislead the public about the Bill as well as politically flexible definitions of terms such
as misinformation and disinformation. In addition, it will note the relevance of the
Government's own misinformation about COVID-19 to the origins of this Bill as well
as various issues pertaining to the way the Government has ignored common law
and in fact has no validity under the Constitution.

The Government appears unwilling to be fully frank about the punitive aspects of this
Bill. This in turn suggests a reluctance to tell the truth about other things concerning
the Bill. One only has to study these pages https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/haveyour-say/new-acma-powers-combat-misinformation-anddisinformation and https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/202203/ACMA%20misinformation%20report_Fact%20sheet%202%20%20code%20framework.pdf, to realise how coy the Government is being about the
punishments laid out in this Bill. The title of this page is The Issue, yet there is only
scant mention of the penalties laid down. There is talk about Government powers

created by the Bill, and of course these powers necessarily include the ability to
compel by means of fines, but nowhere does it state what these powers are, even in
general terms. The "f" word is studiously avoided. Fines and imprisonment that
punishes free speech are the very issue that has motivated me, and no doubt most
others, to make a submission about this egregious Bill. I also question whether it is
proper to talk of “powers created” by any Act, as if any current Government is able to
create powers sui generis without reference to the people.

Is there or is there not legislation already that allows the Australian Government and
its agencies such as ASIO, to automatically collect information posted by the public
online, including IP addresses? There is also the E-Safety Commissioner and the
Online Safety Act 2021. These instruments at the disposal of the Government are
already too powerful and intrusive without the addition of a new so-called
Misinformation Bill.. In addition, there are a number of laws such as those
concerning fraud. deception and impersonation, that have existed for a great many
years and protect consumers and the public in general without really impinging on
free speech The so-called Online Misinformation Bill appears to be the next step in a
project of dismantling the right to free speech that has existed in Australia since
colonial times.

Page 8 of the Fact
**_Sheet- https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/communicat_**
ions-legislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformation-bill-2023fact - contains more of this kind of evasion. Penalties are not discussed in a separate
section, and scarcely not at all, until p8, when we encounter this
**_Criminal penalties would only apply to digital platforms or individuals_**
**_knowingly making or retaining false or misleading records under the record_**
**_keeping provisions, or giving false or misleading information or evidence_**
**_under the information-gathering provisions of the new powers. Digital platform_**
**_providers can face significant civil penalties under the Bill, and it is expected_**
**_that the ACMA will actively seek penalty orders against those providers who_**
**_routinely contravene provisions in a registered code or a standard, or fail to_**
**_comply with remedial directions in particular._**

This would be laughable if it were not so serious. The "only" needs to be in scare
quotes. Anything can be defined as false or misleading under the Bill, as will be
demonstrated below. This quotation is equivalent to passing a law against, say,
wearing a hat indoors, and then saying the law only applies to those wearing hats. It
is a statement of the obvious presumably intended to dispel concerns about the Bill.
The Government must be hoping not enough people actually read what it has put out
in relation to this legislation.

Under the section What's in scope (pp3, 4) of the Fact Sheet,, there are two
headings. First, there is Misinformation and Disinformation, and then there
is Serious Harm. The Bill is supposed to be about disinformation and
misinformation, yet there is a heading in this section, purporting to be about the
scope of the Bill, which gives equal prominence to something called serious harm. It
would appear that the Bill is not solely about false or misleading information after all.
How would this legislation treat information that is neither false nor misleading but

2


-----

which was considered to have the potential for serious harm? The truth hurts,
obviously.

Also in the Fact Sheet,,we have some more things of note. Firstly, there is this-p1
of Weaknesses of the Code (the current Australian Code of Practice on
**_Disinformation and Misinformation) -_**
**_The code has only 2 mandatory commitments, while the other commitments_**
**_are opt-in. This provides a low minimum standard for collective industry_**
**_action._**

Is a mandate a law and if it is a law, does it apply to flesh-and-blood people? This
question is relevant since the Government is being evasive about the nature and
extent of the powers contained in this Bill to prosecute individual men and women,
who are under common law, with commercial law and its language of mandates. The
Government's PR seeks to distinguish between natural man and women on the one
hand, and corporations on the other, while the Bill itself conflates the two. The
current code is also weak because
**_The code excludes some services where misinformation or disinformation can_**
**_propagate, such as private messaging services. This would seem to belie any_**
reassurances that this Bill will not target private individuals.

In the Fact Sheet, the Government is states that it wishes to extend its legislative
powers to individuals by stating that the current system does not allow this, On p16
of the Guidance Notes it say this-This section of the Bill {Clause 21} only
**_applies to individual natural persons who own and operate a digital platform_**
**_service. The vast majority of providers of digital platform services are body_**
**_corporates, which have no privilege against self-incrimination._**

It will become apparent that "the vast majority" mentioned here is as fungible a
definition as anything else in the Bill.

The Bill allow the Minister to redefine the meaning of digital provider**_6) of Schedule 1 of the_**
Bill https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/communications
-legislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformation-bill2023, states,
**_The Minister may, by legislative instrument, specify that a kind of2_**
**_digital service is a digital platform service if the Minister is3_**
**_satisfied that it is appropriate to apply provisions of this Schedule4_**
**_to the digital service to provide adequate protection for the_**
**_community._**

Does this mean the Minister would be able to specify previously-exempt activities
and services, which include those of a type far more likely to be run by individuals
and not body corporates, such as private messenger services?

People have a right to be suspicious when the Government's own literature reveals a
desire to "improve" on the current Code by allowing prosecution of private message
service providers. On p22 of the Guidance Notes, penalties of up to 100 penalty
units may be imposed on persons who breach the legislation. Since penalty units

include imprisonment as well as fines, and body corporates cannot be imprisoned,
and presumably the Bill could have been drafted to specify fines only, it is clear that
this Bill is partly aimed at natural men and women who defy the Government.
Clauses 21 and 22 of the Bill which allow imprisonment for up to 12 months.

Individuals will not be exempt from appearing before the ACMA, as shown herep25, Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 **_19 ACMA may obtain information and documents from other 15 persons 16_**
**_Scope 17 (1) This clause applies to a person if: 18 (a) the ACMA has reason to_**
**_believe that the person: 19 (i) has information or a document that is relevant to_**
**_a 20 matter mentioned in subclause (2); or 21 (ii) is capable of giving evidence_**
**_which the ACMA has 22 reason to believe is relevant to a matter mentioned in_**
**_23 subclause (2); and 24 (b) the ACMA considers that it requires the_**
**_information, 25 document or evidence for the performance of the ACMA’s 26_**
**_function under paragraph 10(1)(md) of the Australian 27 Communications and_**
**_Media Authority Act 2005._**

Even if the Bill indisputably excluded members of the public, it would still represent a
very serious attack on freedom of speech. Consider what might happen if someone
who owns or works for a digital platform provider has a genuine difference of opinion
over some matter deemed misinformation by the so-called Australian Government. If
that individual does not obey directions from the ACMA, they could find themselves
in prison. Furthermore, if they provide details of users who hold unacceptable views,
the Government could charge those people under laws such as the Terrorism
**_Act  that are as open to interpretation as the Combatting_** **_Misinformation and_**
**_Disinformation Bill. This Bill could therefore be used in conjunction with Acts_**
already in place to criminalize free speech and legitimate dissent in Australia. This is
especially so when one notes that the Bill that has been provided to the public is an
exposure draft only and may be changed for the worst in the process of its becoming
an Act.

It is true that there is this from p22 0f the Guidance Notes- any information or
**_evidence or producing document cannot be used against the individual in_**
**_criminal proceedings other than proceedings for an offence for giving false or_**
**_misleading information under the Criminal Code and subclause 22(1) of this_**
**_Bill._** However, given the other dishonesty that is apparent in the Bill itself and the
way it is being explained by the Government, there is no reason to trust this
assertion. Many people, including myself, were prosecuted under ultra
_vires interpretations of the various Public health Acts and Biosecurity Acts, etc., that_
were in place during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic.

This report does not mention COVID-19 in its
title, https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/202111/Adequacy%20of%20digital%20platforms%20disinformation%20and%20news%2
0quality%20measures.pdf
but COVID misinformation, as defined by the Government, is its main concern. Is
the term misinformation here used in the same way as in the Exposure Draft and is
this Bill designed to prevent a similar level scepticism towards government policy as
during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic?

Passage of this Bill would then allow a new target to be pursued.-criminalizing online
free speech by individuals,. Outlawing offline freedom of expression, as has
happened to some extant already, for example with Queensland's Criminal Code
**_(Serious Vilification and hate Crimes Act 2023) would then follow that. Less_**
serious but still worth noting, criminalizing corporate speech could lead to costs
being transferred to consumers, thereby deadening debate by excluding the less
well-off from some online discussion., I also believe it will be used as a back door to
force companies that provide online services to require people to submit their real
identities in order for these companies to not be liable under the legislation. I am
certain that this has been a cherished dream of governments for many years.

The public needs to know more about the industry self-regulation that comprises part
of this Bill. Discussion of exactly what this might be and how industry is expected to
cooperate with the Government, to my mind is conspicuously lacking in the
legislation itself, the guidance notes and the fact sheet.

The Government exempts itself and other approved actors from this Bill (2.1.4, pp
12/13). Why is this so? Does the Government not desire the public to be protected
from misinformation from itself, professional news content, educational institutes,
etc.? It is extremely obvious what the Government's game is.

As for the satire exemption,
**_Satire Content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment,_**
**_parody or satire will be excluded, even if the content is at surface value,_**
**_misinformation, it remains to be seen whether this will be honoured. It would_**
always be possible to claim that a piece of content is not satire when it is in fact
satire.

The Government exempts itself and certain other bodies from this legislation, but
what does it exempt itself from? it exempts itself from a very vague list of threats**_Exposure Draft, p16, 7 Misinformation and disinformation_**
(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a 6
**_digital service is misinformation on the digital service if: 7 (a) the content_**
**_contains information that is false, misleading or 8 deceptive; and 9 (b) the_**
**_content is not excluded content for misinformation 10 purposes; and 11 (c) the_**
**_content is provided on the digital service to one or more 12 end-users in_**
**_Australia; and 13 (d) the provision of the content on the digital service is 14_**
**_reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm. 15 (2) For the_**
**_purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a 16 digital service_**
**_is disinformation on the digital service if: 17 (a) the content contains_**
**_information that is false, misleading or 18 deceptive; and 19 (b) the content is_**
**_not excluded content for misinformation 20 purposes; and 21 (c) the content is_**
**_provided on the digital service to one or more 22 end-users in Australia; and_**
**_23 (d) the provision of the content on the digital service is 24 reasonably likely_**
**_to cause or contribute to serious harm; and 25 (e) the person disseminating, or_**
**_causing the dissemination of, the 26 content intends that the content deceive_**
**_another person. 27 Note: Disinformation includes disinformation by or on_**
**_behalf of a foreign 28 power. 29 (3) For the purposes of this Schedule, in_**

-----

**_determining whether the 30 provision of content on a digital service is_**
**_reasonably likely to 31 cause or contribute to serious harm, have regard to the_**
**_following 32 matters: 33 (a) the circumstances in which the content is_**
**_disseminated;_**
**_(b) the subject matter of the false, misleading or deceptive 2 information in the_**
**_content; 3 (c) the potential reach and speed of the dissemination; 4 (d) the_**
**_severity of the potential impacts of the dissemination; 5 (e) the author of the_**
**_information; 6 (f) the purpose of the dissemination; 7 (g) whether the_**
**_information has been attributed to a source and, 8 if so, the authority of the_**
**_source and whether the attribution is 9 correct; 10 (h) other related false,_**
**_misleading or deceptive information 11 disseminated; 12 (i) any other relevant_**
**_matter._**

Referring to the 11 (ii), who decides what constitutes a relevant matter? Who
decides any of this?

Page 2 of the Fact Sheet says

**_The Bill defines misinformation and disinformation as follows:_**

**_Misinformation is online content that is false, misleading or_**
**_deceptive, that is shared or created without an intent to deceive but_**
**_can cause and contribute to serious harm._**

**_Disinformation is misinformation that is intentionally disseminated_**
**_with the intent to deceive or cause serious harm._**

**_Serious harm is harm that affects a significant portion of the Australian_**
**_population, economy or environment, or undermines the integrity of an_**
**_Australian democratic process._**

This is more vagueness as to the meaning of words that are supposed to be central
to the purpose of the Bill. One man's misinformation or disinformation is another
man's truth, one man's harm is another man's life-saving information, and one man's
lies are another man's truth.

**_The Minister may also by legislative instrument specify the addition of a new_**
**_subcategory of digital platform service to the list above as different types of_**
**_services emerge over time and risks of misinformation and disinformation_**
**_evolve on certain services._**
**_This is deeply undemocratic, but is very much in line with the fungible nature_**
**_of the legislation as a whole. The Bill seeks to "protect the community"_**
**_(undefined), from disinformation and misinformation, things which can also be_**
**_redefined by the Minister with no parliamentary, let along popular, oversight._**
**_that might be "harmless" or which encourages "hate" etc. Similarly,_**
**_The Minister may also by legislative instrument specify a digital platform_**
**_service to be exempt from the ACMA powers. These services are excluded_**
**_services for misinformation purposes,_**

The Bill might as well say the Minister can make it up as he or she goes along.

From Schedule 1 of the Exposure Draft (p10), there is this-harm means any of the
**_following: 8 (a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of 9_**
**_ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, 10 religion or_**
**_physical or mental disability; 11 (b) disruption of public order or society in_**
**_Australia; 12 (c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of_**
**_13 Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government 14 institutions; 15 (d)_**
**_harm to the health of Australians; 16 (e) harm to the Australian environment;_**
**_17 (f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian 18 economy or_**
**_a sector of the Australian economy._**
Again, who decides these definitions?

It would be possible to provide more examples of vagueness from both the Exposure
Draft itself and the accompanying propaganda. It is abundantly clear that this is a
Bill that lists threats that are so vague, they could mean anything according to the
whim of the Government of the day. Vague as they are though, they are not so
vague that the Government has not seen the necessity of exempting itself. The Bill is
intended to be applied, that much is clear.

I wish to remind readers that this country was founded on a Constitution that
included English Common Law as one of its foundational principles .In my view, this
makes the extraterritorial application of this Bill dubious.

One tenet of common law is the right not to incriminate oneself. I am aware that the
law makes certain exceptions to the right to refrain from incriminating oneself, and
perhaps in certain limited circumstances this is warranted. To my mind, being hauled
before ACMA for violating very vague definitions the Government has exempted
itself from, hardly counts What is more, the legislation and accompanying literature
refers to the common law privilege of being allowed to not incriminate oneself. It
seems as though the people the taxpayers have supported while they have written
and approved this do not know the difference between rights and privileges. Not
incriminating oneself is a common law right, not a privilege, and that it is
safeguarded by the legal tradition upon which this country is founded. Those
responsible for this (Guidance Notes 3.3.2 Self-incrimination (Clause 21),
**_The common law privilege against self-incrimination entitles an individual to_**
**_refuse to answer any question, or produce any document, if the answer or the_**
**_production would tend to incriminate that person – broadly referred to as the_**
**_privilege against self-incrimination....are either somehow incredibly ill-informed for_**
the positions they hold or are attainted of Treason.

Ignorance of or opposition to the common law and the Constitution would certainly
accord with the invalid Royal Assent and Coat of Arms used to authorise the Bill**_Exposure Draft, p2_**
**_Use of the Coat of Arms The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet_**
**_sets the terms under which the Coat of Arms is used. Please refer to the_**
**_Commonwealth Coat of Arms - Information and Guidelines publication_**
**_available at http://www.pmc.gov.au. This is the seal of the so-called Australian_**
Government provided by the Royal Style and Titles Act 1973 and has no
constitutional validity. Would a future Government one day decide that assertions

such as this are misinformation that are likely to spread hate or cause harm and
therefore be prosecuted under this Bill?
