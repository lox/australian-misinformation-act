I am greatly concerned by the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023 and its potential impact on free speech.

The hope that this bill will be used only for good – when it can so easily be used for unjust censorship – I think is naïve. Anyone
who has studied history should know that we can never afford to put our trust in the inherent good of any leadership group when
there are no proper safeguards in place.

Thank you for considering my submission. I hope you will be convinced that freedom of speech and the open exchange of ideas
are non-negotiable.

Yours faithfully,
