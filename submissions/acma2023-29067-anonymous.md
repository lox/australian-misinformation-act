Subject: Call for Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concerns and basically outrage regarding the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As a regular
Aussie, I strongly believe that this bill not only undermines the freedom of speech of Australian
citizens but also risks disproportionally harming regular people who utilize the power of the internet
to voice their opinions and share information. The bill creates a two-tier system, classifying
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions as one group with the power to
spread information, regardless of accuracy, while regular citizens, often equipped with more
knowledge on specific topics, are classified as the second group. This classification is inherently
unfair and risks suppressing the voices of regular people in our democracy.

Furthermore, the proposed fines in the bill will significantly restrict digital services from allowing
open and honest discussions due to the fear of costly penalties. The broad application of the code
without any "pressure escape valves" further compounds the potential harm that can be inflicted on
speech and information dissemination.

One of the main issues with this bill is the challenge of accurately judging what is true or false. The
continuous discovery of new information that contradicts previously accepted facts makes it nearly
impossible to apply strict criteria in determining what is misinformation. Various instances in history,
such as the evolving understanding of COVID-19 and its preventive measures, demonstrate the
challenges in classifying information as false or misleading. Moreover, the bill not only targets
provably false information but also true information that may be deemed "misleading" or
"deceptive." Freedom of speech plays a crucial role in enabling open and honest discussions,
allowing room for people to be wrong, and fostering debates that eventually lead to the discovery of
truth.

Even experts, such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, have
raised serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. It is crucial to listen to these
concerns and consider the potential consequences of such legislation. Additionally, the proposed
codes created by industry bodies may become "anti-competitive wedges" used by large digital
services to hinder new competitors. This has the potential to stifle innovation and create barriers for
smaller players to enter the market. The recent trend of competition between platforms in
addressing misinformation has shown promise, as users naturally migrate to platforms that prioritize
community expectations on accurate information.

I also wish to highlight the contradiction between this bill and the News Media Bargaining Code
enacted in 2021, which already limits the ability of digital services to address misinformation while
forcing them to pay eligible news organizations for displaying news content. The proposed bill seems
at odds with the intent of countering misinformation while hinting at the involvement of factcheckers and news content.

Lastly, the attempts to monitor, report on, and potentially punish ordinary citizens' viewpoints raise
significant concerns about freedom of expression and citizens' involvement in public debates. The
division created by the bill, designating certain viewpoints as misinformation, undermines diversity in
perspectives and discourages citizens from engaging in public discourse.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. Its infringement on freedom of speech, the potential
harm to regular citizens, the risks of censorship, and the disregard for international cooperation and
diversity of viewpoints make it an ill-conceived and unjust piece of legislation.

I implore the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and
the Arts to reconsider this bill and seek alternative and more inclusive methods to combat
misinformation and disinformation that do not infringe upon the fundamental principles of freedom
of speech and expression.

Thank you for considering my feedback, and I trust that you will take these concerns into account.

Yours sincerely,
