Dear ACMA,

As an Australian citizen I write on behalf of all freedom loving Australians to register my disgust and
most sincere protest against the Communications (Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
released for comment by the Albanese Labor Government. This Bill is outrageously proposing to
empower ACMA to undemocratically and un-civilly interfere with our God-given rights to free
speech by giving ACMA inappropriate authority to determine what is truth and what isn’t truth
concerning the speech and opinions of Australian citizens on social media platforms while at the
same time giving Labor and all politicians exemptions from these draconian immoral and unlawful
regulations. This is a gross violation of our individual civil rights, democratic freedoms, it violates all
principles of good governance and it must be stopped.

All Australians should be free to speak truth to power, not merely one agency’s self-determined
truth determined and approved in an Orwellian manner by politicians (and their agencies such as
ACMA) who are self-servingly and undemocratically seeking oppress a great many Australians who’s
views differ to their own via the punitive measures proposed to be imposed on them via social
media platforms. These social media platforms have become the new “virtual” town square in our
digital society. They perform a public service which, self evidently, ought be beyond the reach of
government to interfere other than to uphold historically accepted rights to free speech and punish
incivility that breaches historically normative standards of the rights of others at a criminal standard.
No matter what their views, the speech of the Australian people ought not be censored or
“controlled” by their Government in any manner beyond that which breaches normative criminal
standards historically established in free western democratic society, let alone in the manner this Bill
proposes. For these reasons, the measures proposed in this Bill will lead to greater incivility and
national unrest not less.

All just lawful Governments derive their just powers from the free consent of the Governed. Any
Government that legislates to control the speech of its citizens as this Bill proposes is working
against and undermining the rights of the people it has been given the privilege to protect and
uphold, and ought not erode and repudiate God-given rights as this Bill shamelessly seeks to do.

We the Australian people never gave the Albanese Labor Government the lawful power they now
seek to impose via this Bill, nor do we have the authority to give them, or any government, any such
power which would interfere with the God-given rights and freedoms of our fellow citizens. If this
Bill is passed it will lead to the loss of all the things you yourselves are privileged to hold dear and
enjoy including your own freedoms. I say this because, as horrific history of the Dark Ages, the
French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Nazi Regime and the Cambodian Pol Pot oppression
has proved, the inevitable result of seeking to control and oppress the opinions and speech of those
in civil society who differ from their Government of the day, is tyranny, calamity and ruin.

Yours sincerely
