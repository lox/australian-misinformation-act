The current effort by the government to impose its own views on
Australians will be fought by a majority of Australians who have the
commonsense to filter out the bullshit flung at them by an authoritarian
and arrogant government.

The VOICE should be a guide to authoritarian bureaucrats as to what
happens when Politicians lie to us.

We already know our governments will try to slide in sly and intrusive
parts in any legislation so they can claim a mandate       - "It was in the
legislation and no one complained".

A shorter version of my submission is "We don't trust you any more."

The COVID scam did more damage to your reputation than anything over the
last 50 years.
