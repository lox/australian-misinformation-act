Dear Sir/Madam
**New** **ACMA** **powers** **to** **combat** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation** **(the** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment**

**(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023)**
If the Freedom of Speech may be taken away then dumb and silent we may be led,
like sheep, to the Slaughter. â€” George Washington 1783

This submission is to bring the Australian Federal government's attention to the above-mentioned Bill.
We advise that we strongly **oppose** **this** **Amendment** proposed by the Australian government.
We note that in the past 3 years and particularly during the 2020 pandemic lockdown, the Australian government
through corporate media and social-media platforms played major roles in aggressive censorship, suppression of
speech of ordinary Australians and public speakers who opposed the government viewpoints and narrative, including
questioning the origin of SARS-COV2 virus and the government's promotion of mass injections of March 2021.

We further note in the proposed Bill 2023 the Australian government stipulated that it would exclusively allow
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) agency to govern and espouse all forms of media without
being subject to the operation of the Bill.
We believe that if the Bill 2023 is passed in its current form, free speech and free expression of communications
would be obliterated and this is a slippery slope to a dictatorship in Australia similar to that in China.
We additionally believe that the Bill 2023 as written in its current form exhibits oppressiveness and infringes
Australians' moral obligations and individuals' rights to freely communicate either through social-media or any other
forms of communications without trepidation.

We oppose the Bill 2023 because as Lord Sumption, former British Supreme Court judge, said we believe that there
is no moral obligation to obey the proposed law, simply because it is the law, individuals must have a high degree of
respect both of the object the law is trying to achieve and the way it is made.

The proposed Bill 2023 is egregious and violates human rights.

We respectfully ask that the **proposed** **Bill** **2023** **be** **abolished.**

Yours faithfully
Pamela Neill
