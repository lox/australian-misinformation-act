# Communications Legislation Amendment

 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

As an ordinary citizen with an interest in world affairs and politics in Australia, I am
concerned by the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023’s proposed segregation of all Australians into groups:

  - Those with the power to question Government rulers, the media or institutions, and

  - Those who will be silenced.

The Government will be deemed not to have spread misinformation, but if ordinary citizens
question a ruling of theirs, that could be deemed misinformation.

Mainstream media will be exempt from the ruling but journals and magazines belonging to
smaller organisations will not.

Academics will also be exempt but someone calling into question a notion of theirs can be
deemed to spreading misinformation.

Throughout history certain groups have been able to control the narrative – the aristocracy,
the rich, the powerful. However, throughout history the oppressed have needed an advocate
to press their cause for inequitable, unjust, corrupt and unethical treatment. Think of slaves
throughout centuries of history, factory workers during the Industrial Revolution, those held
in internment camps during World War II and those mistreated by despots.

Without the voices of people like William Wilberforce how much longer would degradation
and ill-treatment have continued? Yet in his day his message was considered
“misinformation”, if not “disinformation”.

The vital element which was needed then and now was freedom of speech. It was
considered so vital that after the Second World War the United Nations set up the
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Australia has signed the Declaration (1948) and Covenant (1966). Doesn’t that commitment
mean anything?


Article 19 UNDHR


Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Article 19 ICCPR

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of

frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other
media of his choice.

We face, in Australia, human trafficking of adults and children, abuse of children’s rights to
bodily integrity, modern slavery, violence, destructive policies, ill-thought-out Laws -- all of
which (and many more) need debate to determine the best course of action. This Bill aims to
stifle serious debate and democracy.

Another serious aspect is that control of speech, communication and expression will be
outsourced to unelected bureaucrats. It will also be effectively handed over to the
controllers of YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. who will be forced to censor messages on
behalf of our government or face hefty fines. The individual who posts misinformation or
disinformation might be cancelled but will not be in financial trouble, but his digital service
provider will. No doubt these digital platforms will err on the side of caution – and betray
our privacy in the process.

Not only is this a dangerous Bill which would curb individual freedoms to a draconian
degree, but the language used in it is vague, indecisive, and open to interpretation indicating that future amendments to the Act (if passed) could increase its range and scope.

Please vote against this Bill and protect Freedom of Speech, Communication and Expression,
as we promised to protect them in 1948.
