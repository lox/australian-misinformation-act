Hello,

I completely and utterly reject the entire concept of this proposed "misinformation" bill. It is
an unacceptable attack of free speech which it a fundamental right of all Australian citizens. Do we
not live in an democracy where the debate and exchange of opinions and ideas are of fundamental
importance. Are you proposing to become another branch of the CCP ?

How an Australian government could be so drunk on power to even conceive of such a totalitarian
bill sickens me physically. This proposed Bill must be cancelled immediately. Freedom of speech is
paramount above all in a free and democratic society.
