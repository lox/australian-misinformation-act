**Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts:

l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This bill is the most totalitarian, draconian and dangerous piece of legislation our country has faced. This Bill will be the death of free speech in
Australia and will propel Australia along the Marxist path of totalitarianism. George Orwell wrote the book 1984, in which a totalitarian government
regulated the truth. Now in 2023, the left-wing Albanese government is launching an attack against democracy, as free speech is a cornerstone of a
democratic nation.

I express my grave concerns that the Big Brother Albanese government will be in control of determining what is the truth online. This will be achieved
via a government-controlled agency, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), which will decide what is ‘misinformation’ and
‘disinformation’. This agency being the arbiter of truth is eerily reminiscent of the dystopian "Ministry of Truth" from George Orwell's 1984.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority must not be empowered to act as a ‘Ministry of Truth’ organisation: to have the latitude and
power to “falsify the past” and become a government authority set upon “deciding what they want the truth to be”.

I express my concerns that the draft bill will censor opposing views that oppose or question the establishment narrative of the globalist Marxist
Albanese Labor government. Senator Claire Chandler communicated similar concerns. “The inevitable result… is that (social media) companies will
block content… they know left-wing governments don't like”.

I express my concerns regarding the definition of harm in the proposed bill, as it is highly subjective and includes anything deemed hateful, disruptive,
or harmful to various aspects such as society, democracy, the environment, and the economy. Speaking up against the man-made climate change
catastrophe hoax, despite the science not being settled, would be deemed both harmful as well as “misinformation” or “disinformation”.

I bring it to your attention that Australian soldiers fighting against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in the guise of “weapons of mass destruction” and the
more recent government fabrications regarding Covid-19 (i.e. the government informed people the Mrna vaccinations would stop you from catching
and spreading Covid-19) on top of draconian lockdown measures have shown more than ever that dissenting voices are required to challenge false
government narratives and expose the truth.


-----

Australia needs free speech online to challenge the narratives of government, corporations, unelected bureaucrats, and globalist-controlled
mainstream media and to promote debate, which enhances critical thinking. Whether sound or silly, ideas must be permitted to be expressed and
debated in the public square online. Free speech, not censorship, is the best way to deal with free speech.

Yours Sincerely

Andrew Stewart
