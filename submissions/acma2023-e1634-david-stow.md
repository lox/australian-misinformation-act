# Submission toward Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. 

David Stow 3[rd] August 2023

My main concern with this bill is the likelihood that only one “truth” will be ascertained
and promulgated by a media if the principles behind this bill is taken too far.
Evidence of corruption and outright criminality by those in many and various
positions in and around both sides of Australian government appear daily, sometimes
despite obvious efforts to cover up or avoid publicising any or all information related
to wrong-doings. This bill can easily encourage and reinforce group think, the
rationale being ‘it must be truth if enough people believe it.’ Therefore, those with
bad intentions need only buy enough publicity for their policies or ideas and the
required numbers of gullible, apathetic, or overly trusting people will be achieved.
Then, said policy or ideas magically become true!?!

Does the current Federal Government really think the population are stupid enough
to allow them to control and censor alternative narrative to the mainstream media?
While I am not a fan of social media, the internet has often proved to be the only
source of truth for increasing numbers of the population who have lost all faith in
both major political parties and the tame mainstream media.

Sometimes the deception, propaganda and political bias coming from mainstream
media is so obvious, it is little wonder that people don’t believe it. Who amongst the
working population would believe that the “economic” measures around controlling
“inflation” mean that workers are not allowed to earn too much in case a fair wage
“upsets” the so-called markets and our country loses “financial stability”? Nobody
except the mega-rich dinosaurs that believe in the “trickle down effect” and other
poisonous neo-liberal dogma!

This need to control and censor truth is a pestilence that has seemingly infiltrated
both major parties. The current Communications amendment bill is just an example
of Labor’s version of how to control “truth.” So-called left-wing politics can’t even
clearly define what constitutes a “woman” and we will likely soon have an infinite
number of genders to choose from, including non-human ones. Is this an example of
their version of truth?

The Liberals are no better. They tried to use the US created “war on terror” as a
mode of censorship and truth control. Their first version of the year 2000 anti-terror
laws contained the made-up offence of “economic terrorism”, which had such a
vague description that it would have made speaking against the finance industry a
punishable offence carrying a prison term. The Royal Commission into banking
proved who the real “economic terrorists” were and it wasn’t bank customers, who
were too often victims of the criminal elements that still within the finance industry!

I can see that The Liberal party would likely “wave this bill through.” Opportunism is
rife in both major parties. They would be just as willing to weaponise truth as the
Labor party are. Both the Albanese Government and the Liberals would like to target

people holding similar alternative views to those of John Adams, Martin North or
others who propose viable alternative economic solutions to inflation and other
serious deficiencies in the Australian economy. The people are constantly fed by the
fake economic “experts” and their attendant media that there is only one way (their
way) to solve Australia’s economic problems. A current example of this is the is the
way these fools stubbornly refuse to acknowledge or differentiate between cost push
and wage push inflation.

Again, this bill would most certainly be twisted to target minor political parties and
Independents because their ideas may awaken the people to viable alternative
economic policy. This bill could aid in “cancelling” anything other than neo-liberal
economics. One only needs look at the US, where they can cancel bank accounts,
bury the Twitter files, hide lock down communications, define events as ‘Russian or
Chinese interference’ when it suits them, etc. Actions like this simply galvanize
opinion amongst the thinking public – Julian Assange, Donald Trump, Pauline
Hanson, Jordan Peterson, Nigel Farage, Jordan Shanks; Avi Yemini, Aussie
Cossack, Witness K, Dan Duggan and David McBride need to be heard.

Far better potential leaders than those of the major parties have emerged in Australia
in the last few years. They have recognised the value of free speech and the rights
of citizens to make up their own minds about what to believe in. The concept of
governing for the people is gaining traction. The disease of neo-liberal economics
and the divisiveness of Labor wedge politics are both losing traction.

I’ll finish with some real facts to consider by those who support this bill.

Australia is signatory to the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights
of 1948 which says that,

‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.’

To mark the 50th anniversary of the Declaration in 1998, the Australian Parliament
reaffirmed its principles.

Australia is also a signatory to the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights which similarly asserts the right to free expression.

However, the reality is that Australia does not have free speech in any unrestricted
sense and the Australian Constitution makes no special reference to freedom of
speech.

In 2015, the Australian Government’s Law Reform Commission issued its report
Traditional Rights and Freedoms—Encroachments by Commonwealth Laws which
revealed the many laws that interfere with free speech. These range from criminal
laws against treason and sedition through to defamation, secrecy, intellectual
property and anti-terror laws.

Yours in free speech,

David Stow
