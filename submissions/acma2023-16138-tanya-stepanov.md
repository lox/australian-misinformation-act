Who is to say what is misinformation and disinformation?

The government? I think not. Where are we then living? Are we in a FREE society? My grandparents
fled a communist country and were truly blessed to arrive in Australia in the 1950s where they found
Freedom in all their way of life. They brought their culture with them and assimilated and took on
the Ozzie way…She’ll be right mate a relaxed outlook and could have a good laugh at the world.
Where we can ask any questions and look for answers and debate different opposing views without
merely shutting down any opposing view. When that does happen that is simply CENSORSHIP.

What? The government will have a panel of people sorting out what is misinformation and
disinformation is but they are employed by the government…mmm that sounds like a propaganda
tool. Who has the right to say what you can think or what you can say? Are we really in “1984” and
looking for Hate Speech?

Unbelievable!

The greatest way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to talk about the relevant subjects
and intelligently state your case and articulate your argument …that is communication. And to
acknowledge and respect other peoples opinions.

Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to
articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The right
to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations.

Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech. Terms like free speech, freedom of
speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse. However, in a
legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting
information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.

I oppose and I am alarmed about this Bill.

And even am more alarmed that the government actually said that they themselves will be exempt
from this Bill. Unbelievable! This is not the democratic way…this is a controlled censorship arm that
has no place in Australia.

Instead of wasting time on this, you the government should be more concerned about the cost of
living. The price of electricity, food, petrol, interest rates and inflation costs and helping the everyday
average family who doesn’t have a steady government job. Make it easier for them NOW! Not bow
to minority groups and the unrealistic goals of the future so life now is miserable now.

Remember who pays your wage politicians. You are not the hierarchy, you are only there because
you were voted in albeit on lies but you are the servants of the people.

Who would of thought that when I read 1984 as a student at Wiley Park Girls High School that this
would become reality...

“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we
shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.”
’In the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), by George Orwell, the word Thoughtcrime
describes a person's politically unorthodox thoughts, beliefs, and doubts that politically contradict
the tenets of Ingsoc (English Socialism), the dominant ideology of Oceania" …

OR THE LABOR GOVERNMENT
