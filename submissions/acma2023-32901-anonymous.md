To whom it may concern

Personal Submission:
Some concerns about the Proposed Bill to combat misinformation and disinformation

In the current political climate I regard the above-proposed bill to be rather contentious and
therefore wish to lodge this brief personal submission outlining some of the concerns that I am
aware of that are being expressed by other concerned citizens.

_Censorship_ _concerns_
Despite the apparent intention of the bill to not lead to a restriction of free expression and
political formations, this is obviously a critical concern for citizens who disagree with aspects of
developing Australian government policies. Obviously some degree of censorship is intended as a
consequence of any new legislation aimed at curbing certain "narratives".

_The_ _new_ _'Ministry_ _of_ _Truth'_
Using the Covid situation as an example of official misleading information, Liberal Senator Alex
Antic has said, "Labor is attempting to establish a 'Ministry of Truth' with the power to censor
anything they deem as "misinformation". He further went on to point out, "the 'truth' is
whatever comes down the bureaucratic conga line. When the medical regulator, AHPRA,
censored doctors from expressing legitimate concerns about the COVID vaccines          - where did
they get their information from? The TGA and ATAGI," says Senator Antic, referring to the
national drug regulator and vaccine advisory body." So the information makes its way down the
line, to be enforced as 'truth' by these big platforms. Contradictory information gets branded as
misinformation." **Without** **even** **addressing** **this** **most** **basic** **issue** **in** **the** **draft** **bill,** the ACMA says
its proposed legislation is necessary to counter the threat posed by misinformation and
disinformation to, "the safety and well-being of Australians, as well as our democracy, society
and economy".

_Unequal_ _application_ _of_ _the_ _new_ _proposed_ _laws_
As the government bodies will apparently be exempt from the proposed new laws, surely any
consequent suppression of public opinion will most probably be frowned upon by large sections
of the public. This will in turn likely have the effect of exacerbating the problem that it is
ostensibly aimed at solving.

_Impact_ _on_ _online_ _digital_ _discussions_ _andfreedom_ _of_ _expression_
Of particular concern is that the government is apparently seeking new powers to set and
enforce industry standards to combat "misinformation and disinformation" online. Due to the
highly concentrated ownership of mainstream media and the close foreign policy alignment of
our two major parties over recent times, there has been a predictable and healthy shift away
from these corporate and government sources of information when seeking out alternative
political perspectives to the dominant national narrative. For these reason I consider the ongoing
availability of broad and open political discussion to be one of the most important aspects that
we need to retain if we wish our kids and grandkids to thrive in a healthy democratic
environment.

In his 1961 farewell address, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower famously warned the public of
his nation's increasingly powerful military-industrial complex (MIC) and the threat it posed to
American democracy. Obviously this has become a major issue today in the US. Of particular
concern in the Australian context is the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which is
funded largely by the MIC and seems hell-bent on driving Australia into conflict with our largest
trading partner, China. I note that ASPI is highly supportive of this draft bill.

_Exacerbation_ _offeelings_ _ofpolitical_ _alienation_
Giving social media entities power to financially 'punish' the breaking of fuzzy guidelines will
obviously smother a lot of legitimate political input from those citizens or groups less able to
afford such penalties. Furthermore, as Dr Tauel Harper believes, attacking the freedom of speech
of those with differing viewpoints may exacerbate their existing feelings of political alienation.

To make this proposed new situation even more alienating, government bodies and corporate
news outlets will apparently be exempt from these proposed new laws!

_Outsourcing_ _the_ _adjudication_ _of_ _information_ _to_ _digital_ _platforms_
This is an absolutely crucial issue not addressed in the draft bill... i.e. how 'completely true'
information will be differentiated from 'misinformation (false)' and 'disinformation (false with
malicious intent)'. Interestingly, ACMA says that it will have no role in adjudicating truthfulness!
So, obviously this will leave digital platforms as the final authorities, supposedly through their
engagement with industry bodies, fact-checkers, and Al to arbitrate what is 'true'... exposing
even further all future Australian political discourse to the unhealthy relationship that currently
exists between big tech algorithms and the US security state.

_The_ _needfor_ _an_ _alternative_ _(DEMOCRATIC)_ _approach_
Quoting Dr Harper again ... "the very nature of political speech is that it might disrupt the public
order          - so this [proposed legislation] could certainly be used to clamp down on legitimate political
speech and protest that should be part of a functioning democracy."

In my opinion, there is a need to urgently address some underlying issues in our society
associated with the huge level of distrust in government and corporate authorities in recent
years. However, for the reasons that I have outlined above, I believe that the proposed
legislation will likely exacerbate rather than help address these problems. The fundamental
reason being that the draft legislation is based on an erroneous view that 'truth' can somehow
be ensured through the constructed of a suitably legalistic model in conjunction with
technocratic decision making.

Democracy is messy in whatever political systems are adopted by the various nations of the
world. So, whatever the chosen system, there is the need to encourage debates rather than
smother them. We need to have lively debates in this country, for example about...

The underlying causes of the obvious loss of trust in our legitimate governance institutions and
corporate authorities
The unhealthy political bipartisan relationship between our two major parties

How to undo the concentration of private and public corporate media, including how our
national broadcaster has lost its way
How to put the emphasis back on truth through actual research, evidence and science (rather
than through propaganda based political rivalry)
The absolute importance of preserving our national sovereignty

Our human condition requires that we continue to recognize that grey areas will always be a part
of political life, thus the need to be prepared to use open dialogue, tolerance, trust and respect
for different perspectives.

Lastly, before any new restrictive legislation is introduced we should take into account legislation
that already exists to prosecute in a court of law maliciously dangerous disinformation. This
should obviously also include disinformation (especially war propaganda promulgated at the
highest levels in our society (e.g. the blatant disinformation aimed at justifying the Iraq invasion).
