Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the ‘Misinformation Bill’ and what it will do to what was our democratic country. I am most
upset that you do not trust your people to make good decisions. I have always been proud to live in Australia, a
country I believed to have freedom of speech. Let us have the right to have an open and honest debate, where we
respect each other and let the logical truth be aired and wisdom prevail.

Why change something that is/was working well   - 'If it ain't broke why try to fix it?)

I fear this proposed bill will not improve our nation but rather be a step backwards. We already have a healthy respect
for human rights and freedom of speech and conscience. I am proud of this.

We did live in 'The Lucky Country', What are you trying to do to us? Lets work as a team, get on with the business of
honouring each other so that we can pass on to the next generation a rich and healthy society that is taught wisdom,
to be respectful of others' opinions without forcing their beliefs onto the people. Let it come from the top, our elected
Government.

I am fearful of what you will do to your people and totally reject this proposal.
