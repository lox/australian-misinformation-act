Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

My name isE I am a wife, mother and grandmother who has put my whole life into loving my husband and
helping raise our children to make responsible decisions and also to accept and be responsible for their own
mistakes. I value the freedom we have had in this country to be able to teach our children the truths our country was
founded on and allow them to choose for themselves what is right.
The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian people that it
distrusts the public but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is
undemocratic and will prove devastating for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that
responsibility away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, and not government who believes it has the
right to shield its citizens from ideas. Australians must exercise our own common sense and not allow the government
to take away our freedom to make those choices for them.

We all make mistakes, and we all need to be responsible for owning up to those mistakes and be able to learn from
them in a safe and secure manner with proper justice and mercy in place, no matter how large or small those
mistakes may be.
No one is able to be the sole source of truth, and most definitely not a group of unelected or elected people or
parliamentarians.

This bill should not go any further.
