 raised to this Bill, because our democracy is at stake. The Bill’s negative consequences will far outweigh any possible good it may do. 

 1. Democracy relies on checks and balances. The government, especially in its Executive
 arm, needs to be checked by accountability to the people. Creating a machinery which only allows the “official” version of a story mitigates strongly against the ability of the people to hold the government (or whoever the government supports or favours) to account.

 2. ACMA is a government organisation. Its members are government employees. You
 have to ask yourself if it’s possible for the organization to be what it claims to be, i.e. “independent”. 
 There are two essentials for establishing public confidence in the administration of justice: - Justice needs to be done - Justice needs to be seen to be done.

 Where the AMCA is given the role of Censor, it’s unlikely to be perceived by the public to be genuinely independent, and this will undermine public confidence in the government on all levels. 

 3. Even if the ACMA members do act according to their conscience, free from pressure,
 who chooses them? On what criteria? Every person’s knowledge and understanding is limited, so why would we believe that the AMCA has a final and definitive understanding of what is true or not true? Better to let people have their say in the open, and rebut falsehood with demonstrable evidence. 

 4. Sometimes people, committees, government bodies get it wrong. Look at Galileo’s
 case. History has it that Galileo was censored for his theory that the earth revolves around the sun. The Church (and most astronomers of the time) were vigorously opposed, and tried to enforce the “official version”: the sun revolves around the earth. 500 years later, the earth still circles the sun, and the Pope has apologised. Do we want to make the same mistake as the Pope did, and bring ourselves into disrepute for hundreds of years? Shakespeare’s not wrong when he says, “The truth will out.”

 5. We already have more than adequate tools to expose falsehood, especially nefarious
 falsehood. We have laws of libel, peer-reviewed academic papers, newspapers and

 need more questioning, more accountability, not less.

 6. The truth bears scrutiny, and does not need the protection of censorship to stand up.
 Falsehood does not bear scrutiny. It needs the protection of censorship to hold together.

 7. If the government institutes censorship – and there is no other word for it – the
 inevitable question in many minds will be: what are they hiding from us? And what do they have to fear?

 8. Censorship, combined with the practice of only allowing an “official” version of
 whatever is going on, has been used to uphold all the world’s most unjust regimes: Apartheid, the Nazis, Stalin, Pinochet, Mao and more. Why does the current government want to put itself in the same box as these regimes, by advocating the same policies?

 9. Government restriction on public debate invariably results in both limits on political
 participation (especially any form of opposition, the basis of democracy itself) and very real inequalities and injustices. In the example below, from Jung Chang’s acclaimed autobiography and family history, “Wild Swans – Three Daughters of China”, (pages 296 - 297) it was a major factor leading to famine, torture, and economic chaos. The situation described could not have developed in a political system respecting freedom of speech and public debate. Suppressing debate WILL suppress truth, and Australia is not immune to the natural consequences that will flow. Nor do the consequences have to be as extreme as the example given, to be disastrous.

# In conclusion, I appeal to the time-honoured wisdom of the Hippocratic oath: “First, do no harm”. This bill will unquestionably do much more harm than good. A small committee of a government body having the power to control what the rest of the population think and say is a recipe for disaster. 

 For the sake of the Australian people, the integrity of Parliament and for common sense, I beg you not to go ahead with this legislation.
