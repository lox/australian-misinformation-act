# Concerned Catholics Tasmania (CCT): Support for the Submission by Catholics for Renewal
**on the Exposure Draft of the Australian Government’s Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (3 August 2023).**

Concerned Catholics Tasmania (CCT) is a colleague group to Catholics for Renewal (CfR) with the
common purpose of working for the renewal and reform of the Catholic Church. CCT is supportive
of the key claim of the CfR submission, which reads as follows:

_We submit the Catholic Church’s official doctrine that ‘the inclination [to homosexuality] must be seen as_
_an objective disorder’ (Homosexualitatis Problema, CDF 1986), and that morally ‘homosexual acts are_
_intrinsically disordered’[1] (Catechism of the Catholic Church n. 2357)_

_(a)_ _will fall foul of the proposed legislation, and_
_(b)_ _that no exemption should be granted to teach it on the relevant media platforms, and_
_(c)_ _that, if it is to be taught on those platforms, the bill ought to be amended to require the church (and_

_other religious bodies teaching it on such platforms) to accompany the teaching with an_
_acknowledgment that modern psychiatry has ceased to regard homosexuality as a disorder, and_
_instead regards it as falling on the spectrum of norm sexuality._

In Tasmania, we have concerns regarding the current Catholic Church senior leadership, which is
openly committed to implementing the traditional doctrine of the Church that condemns
homosexuality as an ‘objective disorder’ and homosexual acts as morally ‘disordered’. This teaching
has the potential to damage the human dignity and rights of staff, clients and students in the
Catholic Diocese who identify as LGBTIQA+. Further, Catholic schools and organisations in Tasmania
are required to endorse the doctrine through curricula, policies, organisational culture and daily
practice.

The official teachings of the Catholic Church that relate to homosexuality, sexuality and gender are
all accessible online.

Those who are employed within Church governed organisations can be hampered in their ministry
and duty of care by enforcement of these traditionalist doctrines. The doctrines are at variance
with the findings of credible, contemporary science, accepted in Australia and in the majority of
countries across the world.

Concerned Catholics Tasmania, support the arguments laid out in the body of the submission in
defence of points (a), (b) and (c) outlined above. We support the conclusion of the CfR submission
that insistence on Catholic doctrine related to homosexuality leaves the Church open to be exposed
as discriminatory and unjust in its relationships with those LGBTIQA+ people it is called to serve
within its officially registered public services.
