HAVING MY SAY

1. What Freedom of Speech rules are contemplated to control decisions made by whoever is

going to make them. What appeal will be IMMEDIATELY available. To whom will the appeal
be made?

2. Exactly who in the ACMA, or elsewhere, will decide acceptable standards or otherwise when

proposed by digital platforms?

3. Surely, you’re not suggesting that unelected, untrained, poorly educated, maybe poorly

literate public servants (i.e., ACMA staff) will make decisions on, just as an example:
Subdivision B, 51(1)? Or indeed, anything else.

4. Even an expert panel drawn from the wide public is going to have a hell of a job avoiding

political/religious/lifestyle/etc, etc bias. Who chooses them? And what about their bias?

5. How will you guarantee an unbiased review panel should a digital platform wish to appeal.

And shouldn’t it be outside the ACMA?

6. What safeguards will protect the ACMA “deciders” from government pressure?
7. Seeing that governments of all persuasions couldn’t (as is now clear to everyone, not only

those who were calling it at the time) be trusted to supply honest information during Covid,
why would we even be contemplating giving a government department the final say?

8. And seeing that governments were a prime source of both disinformation AND

misinformation during Covid, will the ACMA be empowered to correct the government?

9. Blind Freddy can see that this is a ploy to put the rule of law behind government moves to

de-platform and cancel its critics on the grounds of mis- and disinformation, but you can bet
that it isn’t intended to work the other way. 1984, anyone?
