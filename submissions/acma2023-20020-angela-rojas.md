Submission against the censorship of misinformation and disinformation; communications legislation
amendment.

To whom it may concern,

What is misinformation or disinformation? What is truth? How or who would decide this?

In how we describe and communicate life we have definite and indefinite.

Definite; things that are true and permanent; country of birth (person's nationality); person's DNA, genes
and chromosomes (including biological gender); permanent in being (e.g. I am a mother) etc.

Indefinite; things that are not permanent and change or develop over time; academic, status, Identity,
social, emotional, morals and values etc.
Health care professionals (clinical to remedial) in order to apply and maintain their practice, insurance,
provider numbers are required to collect CPE points (Continue Professional Education) which may
include learning new techniques or modalities, attending workshops, research and publishing data etc.
Methods, data, techniques are constantly changing or developing over time.

Good health care professionals through their years of experience have abilities, skills and methods and
knowledge that are not taught traditionally and must be allowed to share information. Their pool of
knowledge and experience is invaluable. They should not be censored as we've seen throughout this
pandemic.

Personal Identity, personality, morals, values, beliefs and status is indefinite.
I am not the same person as I was 5, 10, 20 or 30 or 40 years ago.
People grow and change; environmentally, academically, mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually and
socially.
It's important that our freewill is not infringed upon, including our expression.

We are all having a human experience which is diverse. My life experiences are not the same as my
neighbours but we may share similar morals and values because we are good people.

Individually, as we grow we face all sorts of adversaries or challenges that we learn to overcome. It's
important that throughout life we can become flexible in thinking especially with the diversities in our
communities, yet we cannot dismiss traditional values and practices also.

As we grow and experience life we draw on these experiences to form opinions. Our opinions and views
should not be censored.

Truth is definite.

Indefinite things are personal and collective (community) awareness, learning and experience.


-----

Misinformation or disinformation are lies about definite things. You cannot lie about what is definite.

What this amendment seeks to do is attempt to control indefinite, ever changing concepts, ideas, data
and values. Things that cannot be controlled, unless a person has their free will taken away.

Kind regards,

Angela Rojas
