There is nothing inherently dangerous about social media, and no individual should be prevented from
freely expressing themselves to anyone who is willing to listen. People, ordinarily and as a whole, are
more than adequately equipped to decide who and what to listen to, and whether or not they agree,
especially when they know and understand the source. The danger of social media lies in the
engagement algorithms that connect people to exotic information whose sources they neither know, nor
understand.
These algorithms bridge the boundaries of normal social interaction (including, but not limited to age and
level of education) and are what makes social media such a lucrative business. Entrusting the same
corporations who have the most to gain or lose to self regulate only ensures that their actions will be
aligned with their interests         - interests indifferent to the welfare and welbeing of ordinary Australians. The
Australian Government is supposed to represent ordinary Australians and it is unconscionable that it
should approve censorship of ordinary Australians, especially by entities who do not share our national
interests.
The real threat is in the algorithms and their operators. They have the power to rapidly and
overwhelmingly control the discourse at the drop of a hat.
This Bill should not be passed.
