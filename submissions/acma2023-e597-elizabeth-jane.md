Hon Michelle Rowland, M.P.,
Minister for Communications
House of Representatives
Parliament House
CANBERRA A.C.T. 2600

Dear Minister Michelle Rowland,

Please find attached a copy of my submission on the draft disinformation and misinformation bill which you are supporting.

You may be aware that the Hunter Biden laptop exposing the then Presidential candidate Joe Biden as a corrupt politician who
was making millions of dollars by selling out his country was suppressed in a government conspiracy claiming it was “Russian
_disinformation”?_

And you may also be aware that polls showed that had this factual information not been suppressed during a presidential election
by the FBI and Twitter working together in contravention of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights (which Australia does not
even have as a protection from government excesses) then Joe Biden would not have been elected President of the United
States.

The corrupt State has been protecting him and his son from prosecution and the FBI illegally installed him as a dictator backed
by the deep state while he tries to have his political opponent, who should have been elected president instead, imprisoned on
trumped up charges, using whatever means possible that Joe Biden and his allies can find, with the help of Democrat judges.

Do not look at this video of what just happened in Congress if you are sensitive to nudity. I have never seen the sedate and
charming Carmine Sabia so outraged by anything before! You can’t “unsee” this: Hunter Biden committing sex trafficking while
flying across the United States from West to East and from Washington back to Californication again, both Democrat run, in a
private jet.

This is it! This is evidence that he engaged in human sex trafficking while crossing state lines, in fact, crossing the whole country,
which is a Federal offence. If these explicit photos of Hunter Biden, son of the dictator, his father, Joe Biden, held up in the
United States Congress by Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, do not land Hunter Biden in prison then NOTHING will!

And the corrupt legacy media isn’t even touching the story.

This is such a total dictatorship where the corrupt dictator’s son is free to completely break the law as he likes because he is
being protected by the Deep State, and this is how that affects Australia and Australians: The ALP Federal government is now
trying to emulate the U.S. dictatorship, as though it is an example of what to do, rather than what not to do.

I ask you, Minister Rowland! How can they cover this up? How can you cover this up? By banning this factual information as
“Russian disinformation”? Because that is the example of corruption of government that you are attempting to reproduce in
Australia.

How do you decide what information we should be allowed to see for ourselves? And why are you supporting the political
machinery of tyranny and dictatorships?

## Opposition to global and national censorship by governments and World bodies: – Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, freedom of assembly.

# Submission on Disinformation and Misinformation Draft Legislation

By Elizabeth Jane

Consider this video by Mark Moss:

https://youtu.be/_UUIWQHxud0

Mark Moss in “The Greatest Danger We Face Isn’t War or Debt” (above linked) says that we are
at the end of multiple economic and social and political and technological cycles and that is why
governments, perceiving that they are weak seek to clamp down on freedom of speech etc. This
has, historically, happened before. It happens at the end of a cycle when societal and political
conditions are at their weakest. In his other videos he also exposes three great economic cycles that
have all just converged in a single point a year or two ago, in greater detail than in this video if you
want to dive in to what else he has to say. (See my web site Contact page:
www.elizabethjane.org/contact/ But it suffices to look at the cycles he points to in this video.

https://youtu.be/_UUIWQHxud0

I therefore ask you to consider that you are seeking to censor society on the basis of weakness and
corruption and to gain insight into your motives within a greater historical context. This proposed
legislation is a sign that a new economic cycle is about to begin, and you that are living out the

dying moments of a World economic cycle that is reaching its end would do well to heed the words
of Bob Dylan:


-----

Come senators, congressmen

Please heed the call

Don't stand in the doorway

Don't block up the hall

For he that gets hurt

Will be he who has stalled

There's a battle outside

And it is ragin'.

It'll soon shake your windows

And rattle your walls

For the times they are a-changin'.

## Further criticisms:

1. This video came out on “Reclaim the Net” on 17/07/2023 concerning this Bill and so you

should see it. It is called “The Australian Government’s Plot for Orwellian Online
Misinformation Laws”: https://youtu.be/UTZSM8BUW0g

2. How will you suppress ideas and opinions after the technological Singularity? The nature

of it is beyond knowing. That is why it is called a “Singularity”, because no light can
escape from a black hole: You are limited in knowing or planning by the event horizon of a
black hole. OpenAI (see the Preamble on my web site front page at
www.elizabethjane.org ) predicts a Knowledge Revolution to come after the Information
Revolution when artificial intelligence can “do science” in about 18 months time, at the end
of 2024, when scientific knowledge increases at 1,000 (One Thousand) times as fast. When
that happens, we will advance 250 years in just three months. That is unambiguously the
beginning of Artificial Super-intelligence, or the Singularity. Microsoft has independently
predicted artificial human level intelligence at the same time. It has long been widely

accepted since Vernor Vinge said it in The Coming Technological

_Singularity (1993)https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge - cite_note-Upcoming-1[, ]_

that a human level A.I. would be able to rewrite its own programming to increase its
intelligence to superhuman levels within a very short time, perhaps in seconds, minutes or
hours. Then censorship would be impossible as an A.S.I. would be able to transcend its
programming beyond any human control, and wouldn’t we all, in that case, then be able to


-----

express ourselves perfectly freely in a world that is beyond the containment by human
mechanisms of knowledge and reasoning?

3. I will be voting Liberal at the next election if this is what the ALP wants. I support freedom

of speech. Not dictatorship! And that is where this legislation is heading.

4. I will vote Liberal and my vote may count if the censorious left-wing ALP does not prevent

us from voting; or if it cancels out our votes by withholding information in the name of
suppressing “disinformation” or “misinformation” to “protect us from harm”; namely, so
called “Russian disinformation”, as the Biden regime has succeeded in doing in the United
States to win a presidential election by covering up the news of Hunter Biden’s laptop in
the NY Post, and so to conceal the Biden family’s corruption and selling out of their

country to foreign governments.

5. I want protection from the excesses and political crimes of a powerful government, not to

live under a dictatorship that claims to be protecting me from the truth or subjectively
defined falsehoods, such as with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attempt to ban a
“NO” case being disseminated in the forthcoming referendum on “the Voice to
Parliament”.

6. This Orwellian takeover of a free country by stealth must stop forthwith!
7. I want freedom from WHO tyranny too. The Australian government is also planning to

hand over powers of surveillance and censorship to WHO, an unelected, foreign, globalist,
power hungry, body that is allied to China and, with it, the Chinese tyrannical social credit
Communist system of one-party government. That would exacerbate the powers of this
proposed legislation as the two sources of censorship would act in synergy to deprive the
people of Australia our precious freedoms.

8. If our politicians hand us over to a global unelected body then they are no longer our

elected representatives: The only validity as representatives that they have is that they are
elected to serve us, not a foreign body, and that they have not abrogated their decisionmaking to another foreign body which is unaccountable and is not included in the
Constitution as an integral part of our democratic system of government: wouldn’t these
undemocratic proposals both need to be put to a referendum where they would most
certainly be rejected by the people of Australia?

9. We in Australia are a free country, free to hold our opinions and free to express them and

free to vote for political candidates to be our legal democratic representatives who have our
authority vested in them to serve us, not to be our overlords, Orwellian pigs who have taken
over the Animal Farm, who believe that “all animals are equal but some are more equal
than others” and who are paid to suppress us by undemocratic assumed pseudo-authority
through legislation and as undemocratic servants of an unelected World body with powers
to censor us (and to muzzle independent political candidates) and to put us under its


-----

surveillance, in an unelected and illegitimate World government with no electorate, by
thugs who put us into police custody or into military camps for demanding our freedom, as
happened during the Covid outbreak. That is what will happen again! That is what you will
do to us all. You will do us all harm in the name of “protecting” us. That is what all
dictatorships claim as the basis of their sham authority. How is this case a “special case” of
that totalitarian dataset?

10. Then, if you limit our words and ideas, limit what we can see and limit what we can

discuss; and censor our voices, and imprison us for thought-crime; then we are become
reluctant revolutionaries, doing our best to overturn the military junta; the dictatorship; the
sham democracy, and to win back our freedoms. Can that happen in Australia? Yes, if

Australia is no longer a free country it can. That happens because there will always be
opposition to the theft of democratic freedoms from the people, and because the
government will use such opposition in support of freedom and democracy as an excuse to
repress civil liberties and freedoms even more, claiming emergency powers, as happened
during the Covid outbreaks very recently.

11. And let us not forget that with this global wave of governments wanting these powers, all in

concert, for the first time in human history, it will be a global struggle. The people of the
World will rise against the WHO and the politicians who have given away our national
sovereignty, and with it their legitimacy, who will be representing only themselves, who are
political Orwellian pigs who have established a tyranny, based upon their original claim
that they needed to suppress our free speech and information, in an era of information
technology, in order to “protect” us from perceived “harm”, whether the legislative
mechanisms are Constitutional or not.

12. …However, I believe this intended seizing of our civil and political rights is against the

whole purpose of having a Constitution, which is intended to be the highest law of the
country, written with the intention to hold together the fabric of government in a free and
democratic country, with free elections; and with freedom of thought; and with freedom of
assembly; and with freedom of speech; by which free elections can take place - not to be
thrown away in favour of clamping down on the government’s inherently and necessarily
own biased and subjective perception of “disinformation” or “misinformation” or by
governments acting together to abrogate power to the WHO, ruling over all of humanity
forever under an Orwellian global left-wing socialist surveillance and censorship system of
world government in which information technology is replaced by despised and hated
political propaganda, backed by violence against the individual; or else, brought down
through an unprecedented global struggle for freedom. And who will we all blame, and
hopefully punish severely, when we have removed the political corruption in the World, for
_that cataclysm?_


-----

13. Don’t you politicians see how unprecedented a political crime that would be?
_14. Molon labe!_
