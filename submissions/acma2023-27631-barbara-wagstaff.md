# The Communications Legislative Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023 (“the Bill”).

The fundamental principles of a successful classical liberal democracy which are relevant to this Bill
include:

1. The Freedom of Speech, Expression, Thought and Beliefs;
2. The Separation of Legislative, Executive, Judiciary and Journalist roles and bodies;
3. Appropriate Recognition and Treatment of Conflicts of Interest;
4. Transparency;
5. Limited Government Control and Intervention;
6. The Non-Exemption of Government from its own Legislation and Regulations;
7. A well informed people; and
8. Multiple political parties and opponents.

These principles are not only characteristics of a liberal democracy but more importantly sustain,
strengthen and indeed safeguard liberal democracies.

**This Bill is a direct threat to a Liberal Democracy in that it undermines each of these principles**
**and safeguards.**

1. The Principle of Freedom of Speech, Expression, Thought and Beliefs

By allowing the government the right to censor information on social and digital media platforms this
Bill presents a clear and present threat to the Principle of Freedom of Speech, Expression, Thought
and Beliefs

The United Nations considers this principle to be a fundamental human right of freedom. On whether
Australia protects Freedom of Speech, The Australian Human Rights Commission states that “The
Australian Constitution does not explicitly protect freedom of expression. However, the High Court has
held that an implied freedom of political communication exists as an indispensable part of the system
of representative and responsible government created by the Constitution.”

This Bill therefore directly contravenes the United Nation’s Declaration of Human Rights and the
implied freedom of political communication in the Australian Constitution as interpreted by the High
Court.

Pro-censorship justification to limit or censure the freedom of speech often revolves around the need
to rid content calling for violence, threats to life, criminal activities but it is now being extended to
protection against perceived threats to democracy and “wrongthink” of its people. Whilst there is
justification for censoring content calling for violence, threats to life and criminal activities this
argument cannot and should not be extended to censoring certain “misinformation” or “disinformation”
for the protection of democracy or its people.

In the first instance, and problematic to the practical operation of this Bill, is the issue of what actually
constitutes “misinformation” and “disinformation”? How does one distinguish between misinformation,
disinformation, an educated guess, opinion or a fact? What happens when an opinion becomes a
fact, or when facts and evidence change as more is known about an issue or when a fact is
inconvenient?

The Bill contemplates determining “misinformation” and “disinformation” and limiting the reach of the
Bill by reference to that information which causes “harm” and ‘serious harm”. However, the difficulty
with this approach is the definition of “harm”. Harm and serious harm are subjective these days and
often revolve around “feelings”. The inclusion of “harm” can also be used to justify views or facts as
being misinformation or disinformation because it doesn’t agree with one’s ideology or agenda. The
wide-reaching nature of this Bill will therefore not be lessened by including the limitation of “serious


-----

harm given what is defined to be harm but is likely to broaden the definition of Misinformation and
Disinformation.

The best way to counter information deemed to be misinformation or disinformation is to provide facts
and evidence that prove that information to be false, flawed, illogical or just plain silly rather than to
rely on censorship. As lawyer, Justine Quill, opined in his recent article published in The Australian,
“The best way to stop mis- and dis-information is to call it out. Let the discussion occur and the truth
will prevail”. If the government is convinced that information is mis- or dis- information then let them
prove that this is the case by providing facts, evidence and a logical argument.

2. The Separation of Legislative, Executive, Judiciary and Journalist roles and bodies

The separation of the powers and roles of the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary and Journalist “Estate
Pillars”, their independence and their strength provides checks and balances in a liberal democracy.

As recently reported in The Australian, Lawyer Justine Quill states that “The Bill proposes enormous
power be given to ACMA to force social media companies to take down posts or tweets” and that it is
ACMA who “decides what is false and causes serious harm”.  Quill concludes that “The govt can
appoint ACMA, direct ACMA and sack AMA, which is hardly independent.”

The government as the Legislative and the ACMA as the Executive determining what is mis- and disinformation as contemplated by this Bill contravenes the principle of the separation and independence
of the “Estate Pillars”. There is always undoubtedly the risk that the different Estate Pillars work
together to the detriment of the people, however their relationship and operation under this Bill
increases significantly the risk of collusion. Even where the government claims that ACMA will solely
determine misinformation and disinformation can we ever be sure that ACMA doesn’t do the
government’s bidding in censoring information not favourable to the government?

Whilst Social Media platforms do not strictly come under the traditional Journalist Estate Pillar, these
platforms provide another source of information for the people and have become the 21[st] Century
“Town Hall”. In the United States recent Congressional Hearings and court proceedings in Missouri
and Louisiana have exposed the co-operation and collaboration of Social Media and the Government
in an example of a “Censorship Industrial Complex” and have shown the extent of the censorship of
the people on Social Media. This type of censorship has been shown that it is not limited to the US.
Freedom of Information requests by Senator Antic reveal that there was co-operation between the
Government and Social Media Platforms in Australia as well. This censorship by the Government and
Social Media platforms colluding robbed the people of seeing dissenting views and evidence.

An added incentive for Social Media platforms to conform to government requests has been
legislation which protects Social Media from normal defamation type claims. In the United States for
example Social Media platforms rely on Section 2030 to protect their businesses from the regulations
on print media. This provides further incentive for the Social Media Platforms to collude with the
government to protect these privileges.

This shows that collusion already exists between the government and social media platforms and if
anything this collusion should be reduced not increased as would be the case if the Bill was
legislated.

Further, the penalties for breaching the Bill are so far-reaching and financially burdensome for Social
Media platforms that Social Media platforms will likely err on the side of caution and self-censure, and
therefore be overly conservative on what they will allow on their platforms.

3. Appropriate Recognition and Treatment of Conflicts of Interest

The government of the day has an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to what information
represents mis-information and dis-information: ultimately the government will want to stay in power.


-----

It therefore has the incentive to censure inconvenient facts and information, to discredit opponents
and to press its ideological agenda. Whether through conscious or unconscious bias a government
is likely to interpret whether information is mis-information or dis-information through the prism of its
desire to win government and through its ideology.

As referred to above ACMA has a conflict of interest to serve the interests of the Government in the
best interests of its own survival. Even having comments and feedback on the Bill being submitted to
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is a conflict
of interest, when ACMA is the Government Authority in this department charged with the task of
determining mis-information and dis-information. Where is the independence in this?

Fact-checking organisations may also be involved in the operation of this Bill but this in itself does not
guarantee that it will any more accurately identify mis and dis information. They are a paid consulting
service with an inherent conflict of interest as well. Fact checking organisations also view misinformation and dis-information through the prism of their own ideologies and at the end of the day will
want to retain their appointment as a Fact-checker.

Other conflicts of interest may arise from the interests of its political donors. Will the Government be
under pressure to appease and support the views and interests of its political donors?

4. Transparency

Censorship raises questions such as what is it that the government does not want its people to know
and why does it not want them to know? By censuring information the people will never know what
has been censored, why it has been censured and therefore, by definition censorship is not
transparent.

5. Limited Government Control and Intervention

This Bill necessarily gives a greater role to the Government and cause for intervention and therefore
contravenes the principle of Limited Government Control and Intervention in a liberal democracy.

6. The Non-Exemption of Government from its own Legislation and Regulations;

The government is proposing that it is exempt from the requirements under this Bill. What happens
when certain information is an inconvenient truth for the government? Can a government be trusted
to determine what is the truth and what are facts in this situation? It is unconscionable that the
Government is exempt from legislation and rules and moves a liberal democracy towards
authoritarianism.

7. A Well Informed People

An uncensored environment promotes discussions, debates and awareness and leads to a better
informed people. A better informed people can lead to improvements in science, medicine, innovation
and government policies (for example) and therefore better policies, better decision making and better
outcomes. We have recently seen examples of how further evidence and facts can change our
understanding of an issue. Information that was once considered to be mis- or dis-information has
turned out to be highly probably or even a fact.

Rather than settling for “The Science” to inform us as to what mis-information and dis-information is
we need to use “The Scientific Method” to ensure an issue is properly researched, evidenced and
debated. The Scientific Method necessarily means that information should not be censored and that
people are well informed. This means the people having access to all sorts of information that may or
may not be “facts”.

8. Multiple political parties and opponents


-----

The power of the government through ACMA to decide what is mis-information and dis-information
gives far too much advantage over other parties in the Democracy. As seen above under this Bill the
government is exempt from the Bill itself. This could lead to the government censoring information
provided by its opponents during election campaigns and who would know. There will not be a level
playing field for all candidates.

**In summary, censoring perceived mis-information and dis-information is fraught with**
**difficulties and is poor governance. It diminishes the rights of the people, destroys liberal**
**democratic principles and moves us towards authoritarianism.**

**The great irony is that in thinking that the Government is protecting a liberal democracy**
**through censorship, the very process of censorship destroys a liberal democracy.**
