# Executive Summary


###### Two conflicting systems of truth

The Federal Government’s ACMA legislation seeks to

censor ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’, pretending
that there could never be any legitimate debate over
what might fit those definitions, all political biases aside.

Most important is that the inescapable premise

of censorship is that there is a ‘right’ and a ‘wrong’
within information, which only has validity within an
OBJECTIVE (modernist) truth-system (e.g. all sciences
are objective in nature). Yet this is entirely contradicts
the favoured truth-system of current Left-leaning
governments, (post-modernism), with a SUBJECTIVE
approach to truth (e.g. the LGBTQI+ ideology with its
many genders - where truth is what feels right to each
individual). This is the very opposite of a scientific
approach to gender which discovers only two.

There is a glaring hypocrisy in a government holding

two irreconcilable systems of truth together, using one
as a political cudgel for the sake of embracing the other.
This is a major obstacle to the credibility of censorship
legislation put forward by this government.

###### Unresolvable dilemma for the sciences

Again, conflicting with its subjectively-founded

agendas, governments answering to the political
Left and Globalists champion Climate Change, a
quintessentially modernist science. Embracing both
demonstrates philosophical naivete and incoherence.

Yet science is a precarious pursuit, vulnerable as it is

to the problem of ‘induction’, which philosophers over
the centuries have agreed robs science of absolute
certainty, making it always susceptible to wildcard
observations which can collapse long-held scientific
th i ith **i** **l** **b** **ti** Cli t Ch


is a science that, in fact, collapses under the weight
of a single contradicting observation - more than 30
years of global cooling in the midst of steadily rising
CO[2 ]emissions. There is clearly a confounder powerful
enough to reverse warming, and as with confounders,
it may well be that it (the sun or some other unknown
vector) is responsible for the warming AND the cooling.
This illustrates well the problem with science - it is
always open to debate and falsification.

Any government that wishes to censor on the basis

of a fixed and unchanging science has to explain why
centuries of philosophy has warned of its achilles heel,
and why they think science should no longer be subject
to change and debate which censorship destroys.

The other truth problem for a censoring government

is values, like whether marriage should include
something other than a human male and female. This
is not a scientific question. Values are influenced by
each individual’s personality and predisposition in an
interplay with survey and scientific data. If governments
want to censor aspects of the latter, it must be
considered a mechanism of the social control of values
and thereby the anti-democratic control of people.

The US is the world’s most focused country on

democracy and freedom, which comprehends all of the
above points thus made. On 4 July 2023, a US court shot
down as unconstitutional the Biden government’s activity
of the last two years where they have directed media
censorship of political speech they don’t like. There is
**no difference between what our Federal Government**
**is proposing and what has just been condemned in**
**defense of democracy in the United States. Quite**
evidently our proposed legislation shows utter contempt
for free speech, the foundation of democracy.


-----

###### Government as source of mis/disinformation

The Federal Government’s ACMA legislation operates

on the assumption that governments can ably divine the
truth in any field of inquiry.

**Unfortunately, over the last three years Western**

**governments have provided irrefutable evidence**
**demonstrating that they indeed are the most guilty of**
**peddling misinformation and disinformation. This puts**
**them in the invidious position of wanting to censor the**
**very type of information that will establish their guilt.**
**This leads to a rank and dangerous hypocrisy.**

This document will take three lines of evidence on

such government misinformation and disinformation,
fourthly discussing how media censorship extant in
Australia leads to the loss of many Australian lives.

###### Specific government misinformation

The two areas of government misinformation are:

**1. Gross misinformation about COVID and vaccines**

Rigorous evidence is given against the following
government misinformation assertions:

   - OVID is a ‘novel’ coronavirus●

   - t is a terrifying and deadly virus●

   - here are enormous death tolls●

   - he ‘vaccines’ are actual vaccines●

   - he vaccines are safe●

   - he vaccines are effective●

   - t’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated●

   - here are no viable therapies●

   - ockdowns are necessary●

   - asks will stop the spread●

   - eople with no symptoms are a threat●

   - e have to censor dissenting voices●

Rigorous evidence is also given to demonstrate
that this government misinformation has had
deadly consequences:

   - ustralian excess deaths are running at 15% ●

above the historical average

   - t’s the vaccinated filling our hospitals●

   - xcess deaths are more amongst the vaccinated●

**2. Misinformation and censorship regarding the**

**2020 US election**

Rigorous evidence includes:

   - xiomatic (absolute) certainty of a stolen ●

election from the numerical relationship
between voter rolls and voter turnout

   - athematical certainty of vote manipulation by ●

analysing voter machine Cast Vote Records

   - 2 terabytes of recorded computer traffic in ●

packet captures covering almost all US counties


on the 2020 election night

   - ther weighty verifications such as extensive ●

video footage from government cameras of 2,000
Democrat ballot mules illegally stuffing multiple
ballots in drop-boxes in multiple locations

This has led to an illegitimate government taking
power, cancelling any semblance of democracy.

The likelihood of various US vote rigging strategies
being operative in our Australian elections is
likewise possible and demands investigation.

###### Specific government disinformation

Rigorous evidence demonstrates that the Biden

government directly persuaded 51 intel-agency highranking officials to lie about Hunter Biden’s laptop
e-mails, which demonstrate that he and his father,
President of the United States Joe Biden, were taking
millions of dollars from China, Ukraine and Romania,
profiteering from influence-peddling activities since Joe
Biden’s days as US Vice President.

16% of Democrat voters say they would not have

voted for Biden if the lies had been exposed and the
truth not censored, indicating that the US has an
illegitimate President. This clearly dispels democracy.

###### Censored Australia health data

Australian media is overtly censoring the latest

studies on the harms of cannabis which science has
recently shown to be causal in:

   - 3 cancer types with Cannabidiol (CBD) the ●

most cancer-causing at 12 cancers (versus 14 for
tobacco)

   - 9 of 95 birth defects●

   - 0% of pediatric cancer types●

   - ging users by 30% by age 30●

Censorship will clearly lead to deadly consequences.

###### Conclusions

The Federal Government shows no competency or

credibility in dealing with the very concept of truth,
taking an incoherent, opportunistic approach that
bends it to its ideological objectives. For this kind of
government, censorship is not about truth but is rather
the plaything of the powerful to silence dissent and
political diversity. It is vehemently anti-democratic and
has a sordid history of leading to tyranny.

Over the last three years Western governments have

modeled incompetence and partisanship in regards to mis/
disinformation, being its worst perpetrators. Governments
conclusively cannot be trusted with the truth and freedom
of speech must be guarded at all costs. In light of all of the
above, the ACMA legislation is entirely indefensible.

# The central problematic

 for this legislation


###### What is Truth?

The central problematic for the Australian

Government’s proposed ACMA legislation is the
question - what is Truth? The same question has been
at the heart of philosophical debate for 2,400 years in a
field of inquiry it calls Epistemology.

[Epistemology is defined as “the branch of philosophy](https://www.wordnik.com/words/epistemology)

that examines the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions
and foundations, and its extent and validity.” The
**_definition alone comprises a complexity of inquiry that_**
**_defies any notion of governments having the capacity to_**
**_define any truth, particularly within the obtuse field of_**
**_the social sciences, to be able to censor accordingly._**

###### Government scraps 2,400 years of debate

Apparently, the Australian Government demonstrably

now believes that 2,400 years of philosophical debate
are valueless in that it has new methods of establishing
epistemological certainty so absolute it can drive
government censorship.

###### Orwellian suppression of Wrongthink

Unless the ACMA legislation can propose a bullet
proof methodology, which it certainly cannot, for
deciding all factual or social debates, it cannot credibly
seek to censor any political speech which lies within
the commonly agreed confines of Article 19 and 20 of
[the United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and](https://www.info.dfat.gov.au/Info/Treaties/treaties.nsf/AllDocIDs/8B8C6AF11AFB4971CA256B6E0075FE1E)
[Political Rights. Again, if it cannot defend a bullet-](https://www.info.dfat.gov.au/Info/Treaties/treaties.nsf/AllDocIDs/8B8C6AF11AFB4971CA256B6E0075FE1E)
**_proof methodology, ACMA censorship is thereby_**
**_exposed as nothing less than the suppression of_**
**_ideological Wrongthink, a variation of the Orwellian_**
**_thought crime, and is further exposed as a tool to stifle_**
**_political diversity at the hands of a government that_**


**_seeks to overwhelm democratic principles._**

###### Censoring political speech - the path to tyranny

The 20th Century is replete with examples of non
democratic governments which censored political
speech. The various communisms such as Stalinism and
Maoism, as well as the Nazi regime, relied heavily on
censorship and State control of the media. Such control
issued in what is commonly titled Propaganda.

As such, an international consensus particularly

driven by the 20th Century observations of such nondemocratic governments, drove the adoption of the
[United Nations’ International Covenant on Civil and](https://www.info.dfat.gov.au/Info/Treaties/treaties.nsf/AllDocIDs/8B8C6AF11AFB4971CA256B6E0075FE1E)
[Political Rights.](https://www.info.dfat.gov.au/Info/Treaties/treaties.nsf/AllDocIDs/8B8C6AF11AFB4971CA256B6E0075FE1E)

ACMA legislation now seeks to dismantle that

international consensus, presumably for something the
Federal Government deems more enlightened.

###### Which truth? They can’t have it both ways

Going to the root of ‘epistemological’ certainty,

the tenets of the political Left, to which the current
Federal Government leans, are entirely at odds with the
presuppositional foundations of political censorship.

The inevitable presupposition behind Censorship is that

there are objectively establishable truths dictating right and
wrong and on that basis the wrong silenced. This is their
position on Climate Change. The ACMA legislation cannot
defend censorship by an appeal to relativistic notions of
political ideology and propaganda (‘postmodernist’ truth),
but rather is bound to appeal to an OBJECTIVE reality of
truth and falsehood (‘modernist’ truth).

Yet the political Left justifies many of its social policies

precisely by denying all objective reality. To take an

l th i T d id l li t th


-----

being SUBJECTIVE and RELATIVIST - a person’s gender is
whatever they subjectively feel it is, and anyone seeking
to impose objective, scientific definitions of gender
upon them is in the wrong. Such is the confusion and
**_incoherency of the current political Left in appealing to_**
**_opposing and conflicting notions of Truth._**

**_This highlights an issue with Truth - which system of_**

**_truth should hold sway, objective or subjective? And is_**
**_the only arbiter of which truth holds sway the party in_**
**_power? This then leads to a discussion of how truth can_**
be founded and defended in the political context.

###### Scientific truth

Scientific truth lies within the realm of OBJECTIVE


and science, the validity of a scientific stance on these
issues is jeopardised by any major observation that
contradicts that science.

Returning to Climate Change, observational data

shows the theory to be false. Where increased
temperatures are posited as the result of incremental
rises in CO[2 ]emissions, the observational data as shown
by the previous graph, shows more than 30 years of
global cooling (my trend-line hastily added) even as CO[2 ]

emissions incrementally increased.

**_This immediately falsifies the science of climate change_**

**_given that there is an obvious confounder, whether it be_**
**_the sun or other unknown but equally powerful entity_**
**_that has reversed the rise in temperature._**

The logic is this - if the power of this confounder is so

great as to reverse all rises in global temperature, then


truth - its presupposition is that there is an objective
reality that can be uncovered and discovered. Even
Einstein’s Theory of ‘Relativity’ is
demonstrated as an objective reality. _When political power_

clearly the confounding mechanism
is just as likely to be the driver of
the temperature increases, so how
could any scientist ever pick the two
supposed drivers apart?

Here is the central problem with

scientific truth in the face of political will.
Because science is ever-changing, never
static, it must always be open to a debate

- the very thing which censorship seeks
to eliminate. This document will shortly
demonstrate that the same voluminous
science that was wilfully censored by
government throughout the COVID-19
pandemic roundly demonstrates that the


global media - both legacy and social

- as fake news since 2016 has been
the facts and science that challenges their science on
Climate Change, COVID-19 response, secure and fair
elections, and like issues. Because these are chiefly
empirical issues falling within the world of observation


governments’ science on COVID and associated interventions
was (intentionally or unintentionally?) deficient, and unable
to be upheld in any genuine debate.

When political power and agency is given the

ascendancy over necessary debate and free speech, the
result can never be anything but naked political power for
political power’s sake. This is the antithesis of democracy,
and the Australian Federal Government must answer to
this charge.

###### In the eye of the beholder

Much of the free speech the present US government

has been working to suppress in a manner very
similar to the ACMA legislation, albeit with court
[determinations upholding US First Amendment rights](https://nclalegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ECF-224-Order-Granting-in-Part-and-Denying-in-Part-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf)
regarding Freedom of Speech, centres on social values.
Yet values are refractory to scientific adjudication.

Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, where

science cannot dictate what any individual appreciates
most, so the question of whether political freedom or
tyranny is preferable can never be a scientific one, given
it will always be an individual preference.

a mechanism of covert societal control, the overreach

**_indemonstrable and anti-democratic._**

The invention of the notion of ‘hate speech’ is an

attempt to blur the line between US First Amendmentstyle free speech and the already existing prohibition
against inciting violence towards other people or
groups. It is an artful co-opting of governments and
their legislative power to inflict legal injury against
others for holding often quite defensible opinions
regarding specific people and groups. Allied to it, the
indefensible incitement to declaring injury for such
things as micro-aggressions is just another form of legal
violence.

# Proven government

 misinformation - COVID 19


###### Government was source of misinformation

The title above may appear inflammatory. But any

reader can readily verify the truth of the statement by
looking at a single overwhelming demonstration.

**_This is it - from December 2020 through to the_**

**_time of writing, every Australian State and Territory_**
**_Government, backed by the Federal Government,_**
**_insisted that vaccines were EFFECTIVE._**

###### They said herd immunity could be reached

What they meant by effective is explicated by the

very existence of vaccine mandates, put in place by
governments that insisted these vaccines would create
herd immunity and get us back to normal, such was
their effectiveness.

Herd immunity is a term that only has meaning in the
context of ‘stopping the spread’, of stopping transmis­
sion, inoculating or immunising against infection. This
was the entire premise of mandated vaccines.

Yet the heat maps below show that Australia, self

[reported as one of the most vaccinated countries](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)
[in the world, also has one of the highest rates of](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)
COVID transmission in the world, demonstrating that
the vaccines were totally INEFFECTIVE in creating
herd immunity. This abject vaccine failure is readily
understood by citizens, so why not governments?

###### Herd immunity was never possible

Yet while infection rates soared in Australia, vaccine

mandates with their sole premise of herd immunity,
in the face of a very apparent failure to create herd
immunity, were held in place.

###### This was Government misinformation

There is only one conclusion that can be made 
that Australian Governments - Territory, State and
Federal - were forcing vaccine mandates based on false
information and premises.

**_This chapter will demonstrate that the entire_**

**_Government response to COVID was built around_**
**_government-led misinformation campaigns run through_**
**_an unquestioning Australian legacy and social media._**


-----

###### Governments’ failure with the vaccines

COVID was only ever an issue of interpreting

empirical data and science. By promoting and acting
upon outright misinformation about COVID and the
vaccines, Australian Governments demonstrated that
they are not capable of discerning the truth about
population data or science. They have thereby put the
health and livelihoods of Australians seriously at risk.

Governments promoted outright misinformation given

them by public health authorities who acted in concert
with a complicit or compliant media, where all who
challenged the misinformation with documented and
evidenced truth were summarily dismissed as ‘conspiracy
theorists’ no matter how damning was their evidence.

###### Governments failed their constituents . . .

Now that the various Governments’ misinformation

has been exposed as unscientific, grounded in
unfounded and unverifiable public health ideologies
and deliberately skewed data, the Federal Government
is seeking censorship laws, which if in place during the
COVID era, would have silenced everyone calling out the
Government’s own misinformation.

###### . . . despite efforts to inform them

Throughout the pandemic there were Australians

who were wedded, not to the media and government
misinformation, but to the real science and statistics
flowing in from all over the world. Many attempted
to keep their political representatives informed in the
knowledge that any democratic constitution encourages
citizens to petition those that represent them.

This has led to many Australians expressing their

perplexity concerning a perceived deafness where there
was no want of trying to put real science and genuine
statistical evidence before decision makers.

###### Australians paid with their lives

The failure of Australian governments to do due

diligence with the scientific evidence, and to listen to
authoritative voices that were otherwise censored,
has stripped tens, more likely hundreds of thousands
of Australians of their livelihoods and also tens of
thousands moreso of their lives. This is the opposite of
what constitutional protections are meant to guarantee.

[From the latest report on excess deaths from the](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/latest-release)

Australian Bureau of Statistics:

**Key statistics**

  -  In 2022, there were 174,717 deaths that ●

occurred by 30 November and were registered by
31 January 2023, which is 22,886 (15.1%) more
than the historical average.



  -  The age-standardised death rate (SDR) for ●

November 2022 was 40.8 deaths per 100,000
people, above the baseline average (40.0).

 -  There were 871 deaths due to COVID-19 in ●

December, close to double the 441 that occurred
from the virus in November.

Despite this ABS excess mortality report claiming

hundreds of COVID-related deaths each month, it is
clear that the vast majority of COVID-related deaths had
always been amongst those Australians already dying
from other comorbidities, whose deaths do not belong
amongst the excess deaths but amongst the expected
baseline of deaths. This heightens the number of excess
deaths we are currently seeing.

Graphed, these excess deaths for 2020 through 2022

[look like this:](https://expose-news.com/2023/02/24/pfizergate-2m-excess-deaths-in-west/)

###### Excess deaths more amongst vaccinated

the vaccines that are responsible. Their data shows that

not the unvaccinated.

comorbidities are also more likely to be vaccinated, we

those age-groups not usually expected to experience
excess deaths. Note that in every age group there is an
over-representation of mortality particularly for those
vaccinated once and twice. This clearly demonstrates
that the fall-back explanation for vaccine efficacy - that
they will decrease hospitalisation and death, is false.

###### Vaccinated filling our hospitals

Taking NSW hospitalisations data, it is again the

vaccinated and not the unvaccinated that fill our
hospitals. Below is a screenshot of a typical NSW
[hospitalisation report from 2022. In the report below,](https://web.archive.org/web/20220708055524/https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/weekly-covid-overview-20220702.pdf)
hospitalisations and ICU admittances are, as was always,
close to zero. (The recorded deaths for the unvaccinated
people are inexplicably high, given they are not being
hospitalised or admitted to ICUs. This suggests that most
deaths of people belonging to the Unknown category are
being falsely slated to the unvaccinated).

[Current NSW reports have dropped the demographic](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/weekly-covid-overview-20230304.pdf)

information records of unvaccinated versus vaccinated.
It raises questions whether previous data were too at
odds with the government narrative.

###### Did governments seek the truth?

The pandemic represents a failure by governments

worldwide, but also Australian State and Federal


governments, to seek the truth about
all aspects of the pandemic.

There does not appear to be, in any

media stories or public documentation,
any statements by any government,
government agencies or other
instrumentalities to review the broad
spread of scientific studies or related
data to determine the most informed
pandemic responses for Australians.

Such an approach was taken by

various US States such as Florida,
but not Australian ones. In fact, the
censorship of so many scientific
studies and population statistics
appears to have never been resisted
by governments. This is the most
basic requirement of any government.
Governments are required to resist
misinformation rather than peddling
misinformation.

###### The truth was easy to find

It is incontestable that the truth about COVID-19 - its

origins, its lethality (similar to a bad seasonal flu), its
treatability - was all firmly in the public domain and
[easily found. In fact there were enough representations](https://www.mediafire.com/file/q62q98vosk5t332/Letter+to+Parliamentarians+October+2021b.pdf/file)
to government by Australian citizens who were
following the science and the data, who petitioned
their governments in writing with the evidence, all in
an attempt to ensure that governments were informed.
Claims of ignorance provide no defense.

Australian government representatives might

respond that they were only relaying to the public what
they were told by bodies such as the World Health
Organisation and Australia’s mainstream media. But it
is surely not the job of government or its public health
agencies to be rubber stamps for other worldwide

entities. There was a time when the
Australian TGA was not in lockstep with
the US FDA - when Australians tested data
for themselves and made independent
decisions on what was best for its people.
This appears no longer the case.

###### GOVERNMENT MISINFORMATION SPECIFICS

 This was a novel coronavirus

[Information was already in the public domain before](https://web.archive.org/web/20210713113955/https://ia803401.us.archive.org/1/items/the-fauci-covid-19-dossier/The_Fauci_COVID-19_Dossier.pdf)

July 2021 and before vaccine mandates were publicised
by Australian governments that COVID-19 was a lab
creation, with at least 80 patents registered with the US
Patent Office showing its development since 2002. Dr


-----

David Martin, who exposed a long line of patents which
could be readily cross-checked on the US Patent website,
was already well-known across the Freedom movement,
with his eminently verifiable information used from July
onwards to challenge the vaccine mandates.

The truth about the US and Chinese laboratory

collaboration to create COVID-19 has now emerged in
[the legacy media. We know that Moderna was involved](https://expose-news.com/2023/02/10/moderna-made-covid-19-lab/)
[in patenting the virus’s very unique furin cleavage site](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10542309/Fresh-lab-leak-fears-study-finds-genetic-code-Covids-spike-protein-linked-Moderna-patent.html)
in 2019, long before the virus was let loose accidentally
or on purpose. The US Congress has been holding
[hearings on the very issue. No reasonable doubt can](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/03/not-making-headlines-faucis-darkest-day-caught-in-bribery-scheme-to-save-his-skin-repeatedly-lied-on-covid-origins-paid-off-doctors-former-cdc-chair-dr-redfield-testifies-confirms-all-v/)
now be entertained about the real origins of COVID-19.
It was never a novel coronavirus. It was undoubtedly a
bioweapon developed between the University of South
Carolina - Chapel Hill and the Wuhan Lab of the Chinese
Communist Party.

A reporter from The Australian, Sharri Markson, along

with Natalie Winters from the US National Pulse, were
well advanced in late 2021 in demonstrating the science
in Wuhan with bat coronaviruses. All of this was being
revealed as mandates were being announced. Sharri’s
book, What Really Happened in Wuhan was published in

October 2021, summarising articles she had published
in The Australian over previous months. The book
launched roughly a month after Australian vaccine
mandates commenced. There was factually never any
mystery about a ‘novel’ coronavirus. Rather it was
governments worldwide that were espousing what can
most accurately be described as propaganda, that the


virus came from wet markets in Wuhan.

[In March 2023 the FBI acknowledged that their](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/28/politics/wray-fbi-covid-origins-lab-china/index.html)

intelligence sources indicated a bioweapon as the
most likely origin. When early-2020 e-mails between
[evolutionary biologist Dr Kristian Andersen and Dr](https://theintercept.com/2023/01/19/covid-origin-nih-emails/)
Anthony Fauci were unredacted in early 2023, it
emerged that the earliest analysis indicated the virus
[was man-made. From an investigation by the Intercept:](https://theintercept.com/2023/01/19/covid-origin-nih-emails/)

_Andersen laid them out plainly in an email to Fauci_
_that same evening. “The unusual features of the_
_virus make up a really small part of the genome_
_(<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all_
_the sequences to see that some of the features_
_(potentially) look engineered,” Andersen wrote_
_in the email. “I should mention,” he added, “that_
_after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike_
_and myself all find the genome inconsistent with_
_expectations from evolutionary theory. But we have_
_to look at this much more closely and there are still_
_further analyses to be done, so those opinions could_
_still change.”_

This e-mail exchange was immediately before all of

these same individuals began promoting the wet-market
origins. Given that Dr Fauci was implicated in a lab-leak
[origin, where he had given US funds for bat coronavirus](https://web.archive.org/web/20210521182016/https://reporter.nih.gov/search/-bvPCvB7zkyvb1AjAgW5Yg/project-details/8674931)
research partnering with Wuhan, there is prima facie
evidence supporting their need for an explanatory
diversion.

Thus the official explanation appears to have been

a foil to cover questionable activity by the most
prominent US funding agency in regards to risk-prone
medical research. This is all now confirmed by a
[revealing report from the US Congress.](https://www.docdroid.net/MLPseWo/20230711-sscp-interim-staff-report-re-proximal-origin-final-pdf)

###### It’s a terrifying virus

By the time Australian governments were mandating

vaccines and news media were supplying COVID case
and death counts in the corner of screens, it had already
been well-established that:

 - he PCR test was inaccurate, with even the ●

[inventor of the test warning it was never created to](https://rumble.com/vcvgld-kary-mullis-explains-why-his-pcr-test-is-not-a-diagnostic-test.html)
be used diagnostically. The US Centre for Disease
[Control openly advertised they would discontinue](https://www.cdc.gov/locs/2021/08-02-2021-lab-alert-Clarifications_about_Retirement_CDC_2019_Novel_Coronavirus_1.html)
[PCRs because they could not distinguish between](https://www.cdc.gov/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html)
the flu and COVID-19. The upshot was that PCRs
were inevitably creating a bogus pandemic of
vastly inflated numbers. The CDC advertised
on 21 July 2021 but never generally publicised
the unreliability of the test to the public - a
clear case of disinformation where government
instrumentalities knew the truth but hid it, playing
along with a false media narrative they no doubt
had at first initiated.


-----

 - n May 2021, Stanford University Professor John ●

Ioannides, one of the world’s most read and cited
[epidemiologists, published a medical journal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250317/)
demonstrating that the COVID-19 mortality rate
internationally was 0.15%, which is within the
[range of a bad flu season.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm)

[●There were cheap and effective treatments for ●](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/)

COVID-19 using readily available pharmaceutical
prescription drugs alongside natural remedies - all
with prophylactic effectiveness rivaling the claimed
(but also unsubstantiated) rates of effectiveness for
the vaccines.

[●Only about 6% of the highly publicised mortality ●](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf)

totals were from COVID-19 alone, with almost all
deaths amongst people who were already on their
[deathbeds, or already succumbing to, on average, 4](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf)
[comorbidities. This was in the public domain in 2020.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Report-COVID-2019_20_marzo_eng.pdf)

[●In Australia the median age for COVID death was ●](https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/covid-19-mortality-australia-deaths-registered-until-31-august-2022)

85.3 years for men and 87.4 years for women
[against a pre-COVID mortality median of 79 years](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/life-expectancy-death/deaths-in-australia/contents/age-at-death)
for men and 85 for women - indicative that COVID
deaths were chiefly amongst those already dying.

###### There are enormous death tolls

Relevant to the above, the worldwide practice of

toting death tolls of those who died WITH the virus
rather than FROM the virus had the effect of inducing
panic in the population, rather than creating calm.

The 6% rate for those who died only FROM the virus

in Italy was corroborated by the US Center for Disease
Control, which led to President Donald Trump’s since

deleted Twitter post of 30 August 2020.

**The social media censorship of Trump’s post,**

**which was the verifiable truth on comorbidities, well**
**illustrates the perverseness of media censorship.**
**It should stand as a quintessential example of**
**the dangers of censoring political speech, where**
**extinguishing the truth allowed the media to**
**continually misrepresent the truth about COVID**
**deaths, creating social panic where otherwise there**
**would be none.**

This is not to say that, in regard to comorbidities,

COVID-19 did not hasten the deaths of those with
numerous comorbidities, but rather asserts that the
tolls were artificially high, creating a level of alarm
amongst those less likely to be threatened, that might
perhaps create a ready acceptance of the vaccines.

High numbers of deaths in Italy and New York are

attributed to the heavy use of respirators, already
signalled by doctors in early 2020 as being likely to be
[significantly causal in the death tolls.](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/08/doctors-say-ventilators-overused-for-covid-19/)

Receiving extensive outrage from conservative media

outlets, the combination of government directives
to ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ in many Western countries
[when hospitals were clearly not at capacity, as well as](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13338650/nhs-worker-covid-video-flu-hospital-videos-london/)
[government directives to treat COVID inside nursing](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/09/matt-hancock-was-warned-of-covid-care-home-risk-in-march-2020)
homes where the virus could run rampant amongst
populations near life’s end and more susceptible to
mortality from any virus, added liberally to the highly
[publicised death tolls. Use of the lethal Remdesivir and](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/11/exclusive-nurse-blows-whistle-heinous-medical-malpractice-covid-patients-killed-remsdevir-immediate-intubation/)
[Midazolam has been exposed as a literal death sentence](https://expose-news.com/2022/11/11/midzolam-matt-genocide-elderly-prison-not-jungle/)
for many hospitalised with COVID-19. Such death
sentence directives unduly raised death tolls and drove
panic. Without such extraneous factors, John Ioannides’
protestations that COVID-19 had mortality equivalent to
[a bad flu season were absolutely correct - yet Youtube](https://michaelaalcorn.medium.com/how-wrong-was-ioannidis-5940e49c9af6)
censored the truth.

Compounding the issue was the inaccurate PCR

test which could not distinguish between the seasonal
[flu and COVID-19. Even the Australian RACGP were](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/australia-records-zero-flu-deaths-over-past-12-mon)
perplexed by the total disappearance of flu cases within
Australia with the advent of COVID. But censorship
again covered the truth of the matter.

Clearly the mortality figures included much more

than COVID deaths and most of this was evident and
reported in alternative media before mandates were
announced. Governments relied on censorship to
suppress the reality. This was censorship while allowing
societal panic to go unchecked.

**_Rather than calmly asserting that people were_**

**_clearly not dying in the streets as per media footage_**
**_from China, and that death tolls were vastly inflated,_**
**_government censorship drove a societal panic driven_**

###### The ‘vaccines’ are actual vaccines

In a European Parliament Inquiry into the vaccines

[Dutch MEP Rob Roos is on video asking Janine Small,](https://rumble.com/v1nimpk-breaking-pfizer-director-admits-vaccines-never-tested-for-preventing-transm.html)
Pfizer Regional President of International Developed
Markets, as to whether Pfizer knew whether their
vaccine could stop transmission or not.

The question was highly relevant in light of a very

apparent failure within all those countries that heavily
implemented the vaccines to slow the spread of the
virus, where the ‘vaccines’ clearly were not stopping
transmission.

The reply by Small:

_Regarding the question around, Did we know about_
_stopping the immunisation before essentially the_
_market? No, you know, we had to really move at the_
_speed of science to really understand what is taking_
_place in the market._

[Reuters, in this case correctly interprets her](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-pfizer-vaccine-transmission-idUSL1N31F20E)

statement as giving information that was already
known,

_Social media users are circulating video clips of_
_testimony by a Pfizer executive, who is said to_
_“admit” that the company and its partner BioNTech_
_did not test whether their mRNA-based COVID-19_
_vaccine reduced virus transmission prior to rolling_
_it out – which is something the companies were not_
_required to do for initial regulatory approval, nor did_
_they claim to have done._

Reuters correctly states that the clinical endpoints

for the vaccines were their performance in preventing
serious disease once a person is infected - that is,
their therapeutic value where they are in competition
with other Therapeutics such as Ivermectin and
Hydroxychloroquine - but not their ability to create
immunity from infection.

What Reuters gets wrong is in appealing to loose


observational studies which lack rigour for their claims
about reduced transmission. Such studies have never
been the basis for public health claims in the past.
Governments have never had the luxury of appealing to
weak studies and won’t in the future.

It is clear from these statements that the ‘vaccines’

were never designed to be vaccines. Rather the term
‘vaccine’ appears to have been used to mislead about
the nature of the shot, leading people into thinking they
would be largely immune from spread, a spurious line
frequently repeated by authorities.

Adding to the orchestrated confusion regarding

vaccines was the change in definition. The US CDC’s
[definition changed from:](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm)

_a product that stimulates a person’s immune system_
_to produce immunity to a specific disease to:_

_a preparation that is used to stimulate the body’s_
_immune response against diseases_

Stripped away from the latter definition are all

conceptual notions of vaccines being a vehicle for
inoculation, immunity or protection against a disease’s
transmission as was previously understood by all
Australians.

Additionally, governments worldwide fully promoted

[verifiable misinformation about the supposed success](https://twitter.com/backtolife_2023/status/1489533531139231745)
of vaccines in reducing transmission with what we now
know were reckless and spurious claims, all while official
[statements already in the public domain had clearly](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19)
stated that clinical trials had not examined transmission
outcomes. This was indubitably misinformation.

In retrospect, the truth of the entire matter about

transmission is very clear - testing was never done
as admitted from the very beginning by the vaccine
companies. As public health authorities were making
bold claims regarding transmission which were shown
[to have no basis in fact, statistics began to indicate that](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027511/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-42.pdf)
the vaccinated were more likely to contract COVID than
the unvaccinated.

**On this issue Governments worldwide displayed no**

**interest in discerning the truth of this matter, peddling**
**misinformation through every media outlet.**

**If governments failed to establish that the vaccines**

**were never tested for stopping transmission, how can**
**such failed entities ever again be trusted to divide fact**
**from fiction - and censor accordingly?**

###### The vaccines are safe

The message that vaccines ‘are safe and effective’

was burned into the subconscious of every Australian.
They were everything BUT safe and effective.

One graph dissolves the claim that the COVID


-----

vaccines are safe. Since 1990 the US vaccine adverse
events recording system has tracked 70 vaccines and
**280 million shots yearly. The prodigious damage done**
by these vaccines is clear and irrefutable, given the
longitudinal comparisons that VAERS offers.

At the time Australian governments were promoting

the vaccines as safe and effective and rolling-out vaccine
mandates the VAERS death and injury toll was as below:

In history, no pharmaceutical drug or vaccine would

have continued after 50 deaths, yet US public health
agencies showed no interest in the comparatively
disproportionate mortality. The same was true of
Australian TGA figures. Their disinterest is damning.

When it is considered that a Columbia University

[study estimated, by comparing VAERS data against other](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355581860_COVID_vaccination_and_age-stratified_all-cause_mortality_risk )
complete databases, that VAERS reports are only 1/20th
the real number, the mortality from these vaccines
in September 2021, as vaccines were mandated in
Australia, was likely to be around the 320,000 mark.

Real world data has also come from the insurance

companies, where the first signal was seen in the third
and fourth quarters of 2021. In late December 2021
[the CEO of OneAmerica Insurance, managing $100](https://rumble.com/vrv4lg-indiana-life-insurance-ceo-deaths-are-up-40-among-people-ages-18-64.html)
billion, was recorded on a video conference with other
insurers complaining that US (mainly non-COVID)
deaths amongst those aged 18-64 had catastrophically
increased 40% in those quarters. He emphasised that
these were:

_the highest death rates we have ever seen in the_


_history of this business . . ._

and

_. . . to give an idea of how bad that is, a 3-sigma or_
_1 in 200 year catastrophe would be (a) 10% increase_
_over pre-pandemic, so 40% is unheard of._

Despite denials by public health authorities and

governments around the world that the adverse events
were due to prior cases of COVID, denials made with
no attempt to give any evidence, these adverse events
were fairly uniformly the already-expected side-effects
seen with other vaccines, as is witnessed by Pfizer’s own
[documentation which the FDA wanted to hide from the](https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf)
[public for up to 75 years.](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/paramount-importance-judge-orders-fda-hasten-release-pfizer-vaccine-docs-2022-01-07/)

COVID vaccines’ likely causality is demonstrated by

proximity of these adverse events to the injection event,
which can be placed alongside other causality criteria.

The following dot points are the proximity data on

adverse events and deaths early in the VAERS COVID
[vaccine records, with this data available 14 August 2021,](https://www.publichealthpolicyjournal.com/_files/ugd/adf864_a0a813acbfdc4534a8cb50cf85193d49.pdf)
before Australian mandates were implemented:

  - ardiovascular - 13% within 24 hrs, 44% within 48 ●

hours after injection

 - eurological - 15% within 24h, 47% within 48h ●

 - mmunological - 18% within 24h, 47% within 48h●

  - he same tight temporal relationship holds for:●

 - eaths - 13% within 24h, 44% within 48h ●

 - ospitalisation - 15% within 24h, 47% within 48h●

 - R - 18% within 24h, 47% within 48h●

  - ost AEs are within 14 days of injection●

The science removes any notion that these vaccines

were safe.

###### The vaccines are effective

As per the excellent UK real-time data found in their

weekly ONS reporting systems, the Table at the top of
the next page shows just how ineffective the vaccines
really were. Furthering a trend already perceived in
week 39 of 2021, around the end of September, this
report from Week 2, 2022 demonstrates how vulnerable
the vaccinated were to COVID transmission, with certain
age-groups more than twice as likely to contract COVID
than the unvaccinated.

While the Table does show a protective effect for the

vaccines against hospitalisation and death, an effect
that was eventually found to substantially wane after
the third month of vaccination and thus necessitating
constant boosters, it must be remembered that the UK
Government, along with most Western governments,
was denying the unvaccinated their Therapeutics


-----

of choice, of which Ivermectin was one. Had the
unvaccinated been able to readily obtain constantlyacting prescription Therapeutics, hospitalisations and
deaths amongst the unvaccinated would have likely
matched the short-term benefit of the vaccines.

The alarming predisposition of the vaccinated to

more easily contract COVID shows similarity to the
HIV AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 90s. This has led
to theorising that because the mRNA vaccines have
been designed to impede the body’s natural immune
responses to foreign RNA, the vaccine may be causing
auto-immune diseases as well as weakening the body’s
immune response to viral challenge. It is not known for
how long this depressed immunity will last.

###### It’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated

Relevant to the UK data discussed above, it was

clear by late September 2021 that in the UK it was
becoming a pandemic of the vaccinated. Already


previously discussed are the NSW hospitalisation,
ICU and mortality data, where the vaccinated are
overrepresented in the NSW hospital system.

In addition to these data, the US Cleveland Clinic

[study (bottom left) of 51,000 employees found that the](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37274183/)
bivalent vaccine demonstrated the same effect as the
UK data above. With each additional dose of vaccines
the COVID-19 infection rate rose. The unvaccinated
again were the least likely to be contracting the disease.

###### There are no viable therapies

[As early as June of 2021, a study by Bryant et](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34469921/)

al. established the effectiveness of Ivermectin as a
prophylactic measure and an equal to the vaccines in
preventing serious disease. Dr Tess Lawrie, who had
previously guided studies by the world’s gold standard
review platform, the Cochrane Collaboration, was part
of this study’s research group, thus giving it enormous
credibility.

95 studies

and reviews
[later, the results](https://c19ivm.org/meta.html)
for Ivermectin
continue to show
that vaccines were
largely not needed
for the wider
population, and
given the dangers
of the vaccines,
the available
therapeutics
including Hydroxychloroquine may
well have been a
better answer for
all but the frail.
Nutraceuticals and
vitamins have also
shown solid results


-----

with COVID.

###### Lockdowns are necessary

It was public health orthodoxy before the advent

of COVID-19 that lockdowns were too great an
infringement upon the rights of the public while failing
to effectively stop the spread of any virus. The World
Health Organisation, before March of 2020, had a
[published stance on lockdowns (reproduced below) -](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf)
that the benefits were outweighed by the deficits.

Indeed the lockdowns did produce irreparable

damage to small businesses which were not able to
survive and to the economies of every country that used
them. All of this while predominantly middle-class taxes
supported all those put out of work, needlessly running
up massive government spending deficits.

###### Masks will stop the spread

Little need be said about masks. Public health

officials knew before COVID that masks were of little
use in stopping the spread of respiratory viruses.
Nevertheless they imposed a measure which did
[damage to public health, all the while knowing that the](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/06/10/ppe-burden/)
deficits of mask-wearing outweighed the benefits.

[With the recent Cochrane Collaboration review of](https://www.cochrane.org/news/featured-review-physical-interventions-interrupt-or-reduce-spread-respiratory-viruses)

mask studies demonstrating they have no clear benefit


in reducing transmission, it is clear that governments
were averse to the existing science on masks.

###### People with no symptoms are a threat

Given that it is counter-intuitive that asymptomatic

people might transmit COVID, and that ex-Pfizer Vice
President Dr Michael Yeadon nominated this as one
[of the most egregious lies being told by government](https://mdrnrepublican.com/2021/06/11/michael-yeadon-crushing-lock-downs-were-based-on-lie-of-asymptomatic-spread/)
instrumentalities and media, a massive study of
10,000,000 (10 million) Chinese subjects overwhelmed
other studies with relatively insignificant cohort numbers
[which had been used to support the claim. This study was](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w )
published in the world’s top scientific journal, Nature.

###### We have to censor dissenting voices

All those who told the truth - the truth which became

evident and clear to all as time passed, were constantly
ridiculed as ‘conspiracy theorists’, fake news and
misinformation.

As conspiracy theory has become conspiracy fact, it

has been the governments of Western countries, along
with mainstream media and supranational entities
such as the World Health Organisation that have been
exposed as carriers of misinformation.

###### Many more falsehoods

It appears that the first thing to suffer during this

pandemic was the truth. Many more lies could be listed
here with rigorous evidence that exposes their falsehood.

###### Track record militates against censorship

**_With a COVID track-record that demonstrates_**

**_that it was governments providing demonstrable_**
**_disinformation, the Australian Government cannot,_**
**_with any credibility or honesty, seek legislation that_**
**_will put government entities in control of censorship._**

# Proven government

 misinformation - US elections


###### Absolute philosophical certainty

**_The all-prevailing Government and media censorship_**

**_surrounding the 2020 US election provides an even more_**
**_pointed example than COVID of government interference_**
**_with transparent election processes and censorship of_**
**_irrefutable evidence as well as free speech._**

What makes the censorship surrounding empirical

observations related to the US elections most telling
is that there are three extensive pathways to prove,
one with absolute philosophical certainty, that these
elections were stolen across all 50 US States.

In the philosophy of Science and associated

Mathematics, there is a level of certainty that the
science around COVID could never have hoped to
attain. With COVID there was a voluminous science, all
demonstrating the misinformation of government and
media. But the science on COVID and its interventions,
while certain enough to guide government policy if
it had not censored it, is subject to a small level of
uncertainty arising from the ‘inductive’ nature of
that science. It is the problem of ‘induction’ which
sentences science to be always changing.

**_What the elections data offers is something far_**

**_beyond Science’s relative certainties - mathematical_**
**_certainty which, again, in one case is absolute._**

###### About mathematical certainty

Even a 12 year-old understands that 2+2 = 4 is

_absolutely certain. No amount of scientific observations_
_can change that fact or disprove it. And the slightly_
more complex (2+2) x 3 = 12 likewise can never change.
Mathematicians can build whole systems of complex
mathematics all with as much absolute certainty as 2+2

hil h h l h b l i ti


of science are because they are (big terms ahead!) a
_posteriori while the absolute certainty of mathematics_
comes from it being a priori. The relationship between
numbers within mathematics is titled ‘axiomatic’, and
axiomatic certainty is absolute certainty.

There are two ways of proving, yes proving, with a

_priori certainty that the 2020 elections were stolen._

###### Axiomatic - voter rolls[[vote outcomes

Within a matter of months after the US Presidential

election of 3 November 2020, Dr Douglas Frank,
a renowned physicist whose scientific articles and
discoveries have featured on the covers of the
world’s top scientific journals, Nature and Science,
[demonstrated in a video Scientific Proof that there was](https://ugetube.com/watch/mike-lindell-presents-scientific-proof_GVahOqnmeZ1ctdG.html)
an axiomatic numerical relationship between the voter
rolls and the vote outcomes in all 88 counties within his
home state of Ohio.

By back-calculating in just a handful of Ohio counties

from the percentage relationship between voter rolls
and voter turnout for each age increment from age
18 through age 65+, Frank was able to determine
**_a mathematical algorithm which allowed him to_**
**_calculate voter turnout from voter registration data for_**


-----

**_each age-group in every other Ohio county and predict_**
**_often with 99%+ accuracy._**

Turning to other US States, Frank discovered that

every State he analysed had the same axiomatic
relationship between county voter registrations as
they stood on election night (but not necessarily a day
or two later when thousands of voters were removed
by many counties from the same voter rolls) and the
voter turnout for each age increment. Yet while the
algorithm differed from State to State, it was always
identical across every county within that State. Many
other mathematicians have verified Frank’s algorithm
discovery across all 50 US States.

Analysing the certainty of Douglas Frank’s extensive

evidence for many hundreds of counties across 20odd States, it is abundantly clear that he is using only
government data for voter registrations for each county
and government data for the voter turnout. There is no
**_private data that Frank injects into his analysis._**

The relationship between voter registrations and

the voter turnout is mediated by a mathematical ‘6th
degree polynomial’, the curve of which is displayed, for
the 88 counties in Ohio, in the video. This yields the
following picture:

###### County registration number


Government data


The mathematical
numerical relationship
between the two
government datasets
was found by Dr Frank to
be a mathematical 6th
degree polynomial - the
relationship is therefore
mathematically determined
and axiomatically certain - a
sure sign that US election
results are computer
generated, having nothing
whatsoever to do with
actual votes by voters

###### County’s voter turnout


Government data


It is therefore an absolute certainty that US elections

are fake and computer-generated, with election
results run by whomever is manipulating the US voter
machines, tabulators, electronic poll books and vote
outcome software. As much as Left-wing fact-checkers
have tried to debunk this evidence, usually by using
the altered voter rolls that were not the ones used on


election night, Douglas Franks’ evidence is unassailable.

The fact that this evidence is heavily censored

while being the demonstrable truth is very telling.
It demonstrates a desperation by the Left-wing US
government to cheat to regain power and a complicit
media that can assess the truth of this evidence as well
as any other - yet they too are desperate to hide the
truth of a stolen election.

###### Certainty - Cast Vote Records from machines

Voting machines are used almost universally across

US States - Dominion, Hart, ES&S, Diebold - these are
the names of the various voting machine companies.

Both Democrats and Republicans are visibly vocal

about the vulnerability of these machines to outside
hackers. Demonstrated hundreds of times at ‘whitehat’ hackers’ conventions to US politicians, many
leading Democrats such as Vice President Kamala
Harris and 2020 Presidential primary contender for the
[Democrats, Elizabeth Warren, are on video protesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl-b6dR7tCE)
about the speed (2 minutes) and ease with which they
[are controlled. In fact an entire 2020 documentary, Kill](https://www.hulu.com/movie/kill-chain-the-cyber-war-on-americas-elections-aac53b14-2184-4dd4-b9ed-d86253b87317)
_[Chain, produced by registered Democrats, graphically](https://www.hulu.com/movie/kill-chain-the-cyber-war-on-americas-elections-aac53b14-2184-4dd4-b9ed-d86253b87317)_
shows the ease with which hackers access and take
control of voting machines, leaving no record of their
vote switching in the computer logs.

Nevertheless, every county by law must have a file

which is called the Cast Vote Record, required since
2005 for machine certification. While not recording
the identity of anyone who voted, the cast vote records
on each county’s Election Management Server log
every vote from each precinct as it is cast on the many
voting machines. The record shows a real-time vote
order, who was voted for and whether the vote was by
mail-in ballot or in-person. Most significant is the time
progression, from the first minute the machines are
being used to vote through to the last minute.

There are particular mathematically-certain

conclusions that can be made about these records.
After the stolen 2020 election, Republicans requested
the cast vote records from most counties across the
US, sometimes going to court to get them, and have
obtained them from hundreds of counties in 27 States.

Applied to the Presidential election, a two horse

race, and using a probability cone derived from tossing
a coin, (also a two-horse race) thousands of times, and
retesting the same experiment thousands of times, a
graph of expected voting probability can be compared
with a graph of how the mail-in votes (the most
manipulable non-computer tool in the 2020 election)
came in.

If there was no computer manipulation of a county’s

voter machines and associated mail-in ballots, a cone of


-----

probability compared to actual vote progression would
look like the graph below where the vote percentage
for Trump was only 25%, the equivalent of a weighted
coin that consistently comes up heads only one in every
four tosses. Probability demands that the blue line,
representing the percentage of votes going to Trump
must necessarily stay within the cone of probability - if
not there is evidence of vote manipulation.

What emerges from part 1 of a relevant report

_[Fingerprints of Fraud - an analysis of 202 counties in](https://fingerprintsoffraud.com/)_
9 States - is that most every county analysed in the
report has vote behaviour mostly outside of the cone
of probability, again indicating vote manipulation. The
graph below from a county in California which Trump
won is typical for most US counties thus far analysed.

Results like this point to computer manipulation of most

counties’ vote, particularly where there is a consistent,
irregular uniformity across most counties of voter
behaviour in the last half of the count. There is mathematical certainty of this conclusion, driven by highly verifiable
probability assumptions applying to any two-horse race.

###### Recorded computer traffic on election night

Dennis Montgomery built the US supercomputer

and associated software which the CIA has been using according to his whistleblower complaint lodged in 2015

- to illegally spy on US citizens. His claims are attested
by information in Wikileaks.

On election night, Montgomery, who as a whistle
blower is under a court-ordered government gag order
since 2015, recorded all computer traffic flowing to
and from election servers in all US States, capturing 32


terabytes of data in the forms of ‘packet captures’.

Dr. Navid Keshavarz-Nia, a cyber-security expert who

has spent decades working for the Defense Department
and U.S. Intelligence Community agencies, including the
Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence
Agency, the National Security Agency and the
Department of Homeland Security, also nominated as
“always the smartest person in the room” by a previous
[New York Times journalist in an extensive piece in the](https://archive.md/MRb9G#selection-1645.0-1645.5)
[New York Times, has confirmed Montgomery’s role in](https://michaeljlindell.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANTHOLOGY-OF-HAMMER-AND-SCORECARD-ARTICLES-PUBLISHED-BY-THE-AMERICAN-REPORT.pdf)
collecting the data. Anti-corruption campaigner Mike
[Lindell confirms the existence of Dennis Montgomery,](https://frankspeech.com/video/dennis-montgomerys-evidence-real-and-it-will-be-released-public-soon)
given fact-checkers’ denial of his existence and work.

[What the computer data shows is computer traffic](https://absoluteproofmovie.com/)

changing votes on a massive scale across all 50 US
States. Because the computer traffic data is in a form
that is near impossible to change without detection,
particularly in such volume, and because it has been
verified as genuine by dozens of cyber-security experts,
there is a very high level of certainty of what took place
on election night, particularly as it aligns with the two
other verifications already described thus far.

###### Non-cyber video evidence

An organisation True the Vote released a video titled

[2,000 Mules which extensively demonstrated that huge](https://dinesh.locals.com/post/2083099/2000-mules)
numbers of Democrat ballot mules were being paid to
illegally dump multiple ballots in multiple ballot dropboxes before the US election date. Drop-boxes were
instituted due to COVID.

True the Vote used the mules’ phone records’ geo
spatiotemporal tracking to identify the mules and which
drop boxes they went to. Because many States’ law
required video surveillance of each drop-box across
many locations, True the vote was able to show many
mules each illegally stuffing ballots at multiple locations.

The protestations by some Secretaries of State that

mules were allowed to legally deliver multiple ballots
for their family were shown to be frivolous, particularly
when many of the mules were tracked going to
Democrat election campaign locations before visiting
multiple drop boxes.

Legacy and social media effectively censored the release

of the video to the public by giving it little or no coverage,
or by using bogus fact-checks which were easily falsified.

###### Other weighty verifications

Given the axiomatic nature of Dr Douglas Frank’s

exposure of wholesale cheating in the US elections via
computer and voting machine manipulation, there is
not a shadow of a doubt that election was stolen.

Additional weighty verifications come from Army

i t lli ffi C t i S th K h l h [l](https://electionfraud20.org/seth-keshel-reports/) i

of trends of voter registrations versus actual votes and
_the relationships between the two that have held for the_
_last 100 years, found inexplicable anomalies. His data_
analysis demonstrates, on this data, that Trump should
have won by 8 million votes before any computer voteflipping is factored in.

Very recently a US Post truck driver who had claimed

in 2020 that he had driven a trailer filled with perhaps
as many as 288,000 completed ballots from New York to
[Pennsylvania shortly before election day was vindicated,](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/06/huge-usps-releases-final-report-contract-driver-jesse/)
[having been vilified by legacy and social media as a](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/feb/10/mellissa-carone-jesse-morgan-say-fbi-dismissed-vot/)
person not to be trusted.

This exposing of highly illegal activity by US Post was

censored/ridiculed by legacy and social media, where
again the truth of the matter was heavily suppressed.

###### Australia’s Scytl implicated

In 2016 the Australian Federal Government

[contracted Scytl, a Spanish election modernisation](https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/471f2731-fa2f-e235-5e5d-91fb7b9a53c1)
company, to write the software that would analyse Fuji
[Xerox scanned ballot images for upper house elections](https://www.zdnet.com/article/aec-gives-fuji-xerox-au27m-for-another-ballot-scanning-system/)
to distribute preferences.

Scytl is a key player in US elections, working with

Edison to provide Election Night Reporting for the
country. Its software has been carefully investigated
by the aforementioned cyber-security expert Dr Navid
[Keshavarz-Nia who, in a sworn affidavit, asserted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mied.350905/gov.uscourts.mied.350905.1.19.pdf)
that Scytl’s software could be easily hacked. This is
[supported by the Swiss government’s report that Scytl](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-74307.html)
software lacked capability to detect vote manipulation.
[A 2021 investigation into the NSW Government’s Scytl](https://elections.nsw.gov.au/NSWEC/media/NSWEC/Reports/iVote%20reports/demtech-source-code-review-report.pdf)
i-Vote software found similar issues.

As a side note, Australian elections are desperately in

need of a thorough investigation, given the hackability
of ANY computer-based election count, no matter
who programs the software, and the plethora of ways
that hackers can manipulate computers claimed to
be disconnected from the internet (all US machines
have been demonstrated to have internet connectivity,
ostensibly for updating software). Now that electronic
voter registration recording systems - systems that will


be similar to those which Australia uses - have been
demonstrated in the US to be connected to the internet
and able to manipulate election records and voter
information to specifically allow cheating, Australia’s
systems must be scrutinised.

It is conceivable that our e-registration systems could

be as vulnerable as those in the US, where a voter
could vote at one polling location, have the check-mark
against their name programmed to be erased, then
move to the next location and the next and the next,
voting many times. This form of cheating, with enough
voters willing to cheat, can swing elections.

The hacking of Scytl software to change the

distribution of preferences is a real and present danger.
Again, if there is software ANYWHERE in the election
process, it will inevitably be hacked. Nothing is exempt.
And the claim by AEC officials that the Scytl software
wasn’t used in some previous elections needs to be
thoroughly investigated and tested.

The fact that a number of our State Governments,

as well as the Federal Government, are legislating
against surveyed voter opinion, moving down radical
Leftist pathways, would normally be a sure symptom
that the fix was in, just as with Joe Biden campaigning
from his basement for the 2020 election. Those that rig
elections know they can create any noxious policies they
want, because cheating in elections ensures voters can
never again hold them accountable.

[In recent weeks there has been the uncovering of](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/07/shocking-analysis-election-night-reporting-companies-that-manufacture/)

how Scytl and Edison’s US Election Night Reporting is
centrally manipulated on election night, where reports
of results from US counties and States exhibit the same
inexplicable data behaviour as previously described in
the Fingerprints of Fraud report, indicating that a chosen
outcome is predetermined, and computer algorithms
adjust incoming real data with fake data in an observable,
and now heavily verified process that operates in a
similar way as does a vehicle’s cruise control.

[The upshot is that 62% of US citizens believe cheating](https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1653854970200969219?s=20)

affected the outcome of the outcome of the 2020 US
[Presidential election. This is from the more accurate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/25/which-2020-election-polls-were-most-least-accurate/)
[Rasmussen poll, which had better predicted Presidential](https://thehill.com/media/306721-rasmussen-calls-itself-most-accurate-pollster-of-2016/)
election outcomes than all other US polls.

That percentage of Americans, who obviously source

their information elsewhere, is ignored by legacy
and social media which have uniformly censored or
suppressed all information laid out in this chapter.
Decades ago, journalists would have reported any
information questioning something as important as
an election. It is open to conjecture as to the motives
behind suppressing free speech and debate. But
Australia cannot afford government instrumentalities
here taking control.

# Proven government

 ‘disinformation’ - Biden laptop


###### Disinformation heavily promoted by US media

**_In a clear and verifiable demonstration that US_**

**_legacy and main player in social media promoted_**
**_fabricated information designed to shield President_**
**_Joe Biden from extremely well-evidenced corruption_**
**_claims, the Biden laptop saga is possibly the world’s_**
**_best example of a current disinformation campaign_**
**_leading to disastrous anti-democratic outcomes._**
Disinformation is deliberate misleading information,
otherwise titled ‘lies’, to influence public opinion.

Shortly before the 2020 US election where Trump and

Biden were the Presidential candidates, previous New
York Mayor and Trump lawyer, Rudi Giuliani, announced
he had a copy of a computer hard-drive from a laptop
owned by Hunter Biden.

Hunter had left a number of laptops at a computer

repairer and never returned to pick one up. On the hard
drive, apart from a significant volume of pornographic
[photos of Hunter with various prostitutes, were e-mails](https://marcopolousa.org/bidenlaptopreport/)
detailing influence peddling corruption involving his

father Joe Biden
and other family
members.

On October

14, the New York
Post published its
first story on the
information on
the hard-drive.

The most

explosive of the
contents were
e-mails that
d t il d th


distribution of foreign-sourced $millions sent to Biden
family members through a complex money laundering
web of financial institutions and companies, where 10%
was nominated to go to the ‘Big Guy’.

A year later, Tony Bobulinski, the previous CEO of

[Hunter’s investment firm, confirmed that the Big Guy,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcpJu_MJrjc)
nominated in an e-mail thread to which Bobulinski was
copied in, was indeed Joe Biden and that Tony, as CEO,
had had meetings with Hunter and Joe discussing the
[family business. Joe has famously said he has never](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iXZSj-ttYpU)
talked with Hunter about his business ventures.

Of course, in 2020, Democrat strategists could see

what damage the truth could do for their Presidential
candidate. Within 5 days of the New York Post article,
the story broke that US intelligence officials with
backgrounds in a variety of three-letter agencies (FBI,
CIA, NSA etc) had suggested the Hunter laptop was
Russian disinformation.

###### Disinformation plan hatched

With 51 intelligence officials crafting a cleverly

[worded letter](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000175-4393-d7aa-af77-579f9b330000)
that appeared
to allege Russian
disinformation
without directly
saying it, news
outlets around
the country began
their campaign
of rescuing the
Biden candidacy,
a case of the
disinformation
perpetrators


-----

accusing others of what they themselves were doing.

###### Then promoted with full-court-press by media

From 2020 until April 2023, legacy and social media

suppressed mention of Hunter’s laptop and of the
Bidens pocketing millions from China, Ukraine and
[reportedly more countries, all the while calling it](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/house-republicans-attack-biden-family-alleging-foreign-business-rcna83693)
Russian disinformation when the story raised its head.

Only recently has the Congressional House Judiciary

[Committee got to the truth of who created the](https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/new-testimony-reveals-secretary-blinken-and-biden-campaign-behind-infamous)
disinformation that saved Biden’s candidacy - exCIA Deputy Mike Morrell, at the behest of the Biden
Presidential campaign. As reported by Australian
journalist Miranda Devine, working at the New York
Post,

_In private sworn testimony, Morell told the House_
_Judiciary Committee that Antony Blinken, now_
_secretary of state, was the senior campaign official_
_who reached out to him “on or before” Oct. 17,_
_2020, three days after The Post published an email_
_from the laptop suggesting Hunter had introduced_
_his Ukrainian business partner to his father, then-_
_Vice President Biden._

_Morell, identified as a potential CIA director under_
_Biden, said he organized the letter to “help Vice_
_President Biden … because I wanted him to win the_

_election.”_

_Until Blinken’s call,_
_Morell told House_
_investigators, he_
_had no intention_
_of writing any_
_statement_
_exonerating_
_Biden._

_But he agreed_
_that the_
_conversation with_
_Blinken “triggered_

_h_ _”_


_him._

Blinken is currently Biden’s Secretary of State, the
most influential role after the Presidency.

###### Election interference but no moral outrage

**[16% of Biden voters surveyed said they would not](https://thepostmillennial.com/flashback-16-of-biden-voters)**

**have voted for Biden if they had known about the**
**Hunter laptop. That survey was conducted before**
the 2023 Congressional hearings which have provided
more light on the influence peddling operation. Biden
could not have won the election no matter how much
they had cheated, with inadequate headroom of fake
and phantom voters on the election night rolls for each
county.

What is abundantly clear is that the US media’s

almost univocal support for censorship of the truth
about Hunter Biden’s laptop indicates they are willing to
happily sacrifice truth for partisan ends.

###### Political censorship - the end of democracy

**What this disinformation saga teaches in a very**

**telling manner is that political censorship spells the**
**end of democracy.**

**This is clearly not in accord with the sensibilities of**

**Australian voters and must be overcome at all non-**
**violent costs.**

# Censored health data

 will lead to

 significant mortality


###### Known for decades

Between 2016 and 2023 there has been a massive

progression in knowledge about the effects of cannabis
use - medical and recreational - on the burden of
disease in large populations.

[In 2016, the mechanism by which cannabis causes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27208973/)

[that disease burden was uncovered and announced](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6423269/Could-medical-cannabis-new-thalidomide.html)
to the world. This breakthrough was as similarly
groundbreaking as the identification, decades ago, of
mechanisms by which tobacco causes multiple cancers.

In 2021 and 2022 some of the most significant

population studies historically ever conducted on
enormous population pools - the entire US population
as well as the entire population of 27 countries in
Europe were published in scientific and medical
journals, with the methodology covered in an article
[in one of the world’s top scientific journals: Nature -](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93411-5)
[Scientific Reports.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93411-5)


###### New - cannabis causes cancers, birth defects

What has emerged from this now extensive research

is that cannabis is:

  - ausal in 33 cancer types (against 14 for tobacco) ●

where Cannabidiol (CBD) causes more (12) than
other cannabinoids

  - ausal in 89 of 95 birth defects (autism, hole in the ●

heart, cleft palate etc etc)

  - ausal in 70% of pediatric cancer types●

 - rematurely ages a 30 year old user by 30%●

 - ost harms can be epigenetically passed down ●

three or four generations, seriously affecting
offspring who had no part in cannabis use

###### Media totally disinterested

On 19 June 2023 the Australian Legalise Cannabis

[party announced that it would introduce legislation in](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/20/legalise-cannabis-bill-push-personal-use-victoria-nsw-western-australian)
three States that would ask politicians to legalise the
use of cannabis for recreational use.

This was the drug policy story of the decade, a story

which mainstream media universally publicised. However,
a decade ago, journalists would have clamoured at the
doors of drug prevention organisations for a response.

On 21 June 2023 a coalition of five drug prevention

agencies released the following media release through
MediaNet to more than 500 Australian TV, radio, press
and social media outlets, with not one mainstream
media outlet reproducing the preventionist response:

**LEGALISE CANNABIS PARTY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT THE**
**SCIENCE**

_As the Legalise Cannabis party reportedly lodges Bills_
_in NSW, Western Australia and Victoria to legalise_
_cannabis for recreational use, the Taskforce for Drug_


-----

_Prevention, a coalition of drug prevention organisations,_
_is calling them out for ignoring a very extensive science_
_demonstrating that cannabis is causing irreparable_
_damage to the health of those Australians who use it,_
_whether used medicinally or recreationally._

_Drug Free Australia has recently brought to the_
_attention of Parliamentarians in all States and_
_Territories of Australia that new and massive_
_population studies (50 states of USA and 27_
_countries in Europe) published in medical journals in_
_2021 and 2022 have confirmed what was known by_
_cannabis researchers decades ago – that cannabis_
_literally shatters human chromosomes, causing_
_mutations leading to cancers and birth defects. So_
_great is the damage of cannabis that it is causal in_
_33 cancers as against only 14 for tobacco. In fact,_
_the cannabinoid most causally implicated (12 cancer_
_types), Cannabidiol (CBD), is widely touted as a_
_miracle drug for all manner of maladies, including_
_chronic pain but double-blinded placebo controlled_
_trials have shown it is entirely ineffective._

_A study of 27 European countries indicated that_
_cannabis was significantly causal in 89 of 95 birth_
_defects such as autism, cleft palate and hole in the_
_heart. Most troubling is that these mutations are_
_epigenetically passed down by cannabis users to their_
_children and grandchildren, surpassing the range of_
_harms presented by tobacco use. Another population_
_study found that cannabis is causal in 70% of pediatric_
_cancers. These ever growing findings only add to the_
_already extensive evidence of cannabis’ contribution_
_to psychosis and schizophrenia, associated suicides,_
_violence, domestic violence and even homicides as_
_detailed in Alex Berenson’s book, Tell Your Children. All_
_of these cannabis harms can equally affect medicinal_
_cannabis users._

_Taskforce spokesperson, Gary Christian said, “We_
_know from the US that legalising cannabis simply_
_doubled the damage being done by this substance_
_within a couple of years of being legalised, with_
_Colorado doubling cannabis use amongst adults and_
_close to doubling its cannabis hospitalisations and_
_driving deaths, demonstrating that all of the newly_
_verified harms are simply multiplied.”_

_The Taskforce supports the United Nations’_
_stance that civil liberties are not extended to the_
_recreational use of drugs of addiction, because_
_as iconic libertarian John Stuart Mill noted, they_
_remove the freedom of choice for users, the very_
_premise of libertarianism and civil liberties. The_
_Taskforce further asserts that the cannabis industry_
_is wilfully ignoring the devastating health impacts of_
_cannabis, and like the tobacco industry before them,_
_are putting profit before people._


###### Putting many thousands of lives at risk

It is difficult to comprehend why legacy and social

media are not exercising journalistic due diligence by
warning the community of these newly verified harms.

Those harms are not avoided by medicinal cannabis

[users, which now number over 1 million Australians.](https://www.smh.com.au/healthcare/more-acceptable-now-medicinal-cannabis-use-rising-passes-1-million-prescriptions-20230511-p5d7oe.html)
Medicinal cannabis is no different to recreational
cannabis, except often being more concentrated such
that it will cause greater harm.

At present New Zealand has made tobacco use illegal

for specific younger age-groups because it causes too
many deaths. Those age groups, as they progressively
get older, will still not be able to buy tobacco or
cigarettes. And yet cannabis causes similar harm. Don’t
ordinary Australians have the right to know?

Recent studies, such as the Journal of the American

[Medical Assocation (JAMA) review of 20 other medicinal](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2799017 )
cannabis studies comprising over 1,000 patients
recently found that a placebo in properly conducted
double-blinded studies performs as well as cannabis. It
opines that the unevidenced barrage of constant media
claims for medicinal cannabis creates such expectations
that even placebo works for patients in cannabis trials at
far higher rates than seen for other medicines.

[Another double-blinded placebo controlled study](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.22.01632?role=tab)

of CBD for those suffering cancer-related chronic
pain, showed no effect for pain and related anxiety,
depression and overall quality of life, again with placebo
on a par with any perceived effects of CBD.

###### Why the disinterest?

It is not clear as to why legacy and social media take

no current interest in the recently verified harms of
cannabis which were essentially predicted by in vitro
and animal studies going back decades.

One possibility is that the same three institutional

investors, Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street, which
typically hold 25% of stocks of every major corporation
in the world between them - including legacy Australian
media players - may influence Australian media not to
speak against cannabis, a major investment opportunity.
All of this on the back of baseless claims for its efficacy.

###### An unacceptable situation

**_As the Federal Government considers the censorship_**

**_of free speech, the already apparent censorship_**
**_regarding cannabis stands as an example of why past_**
**_Australian society, along with an international United_**
**_Nations’ consensus, backed free speech and a free_**
**_press. Ultimately, a growing death toll and disease_**
**_burden is a major price we will pay._**

###### An addendum on fact-checkers

[The aforementioned Cleveland Clinic study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37274183/)

demonstrating that with every COVID bivalent
vaccination the chances of contracting COVID
significantly increase, thus defeating all rationales
supporting vaccination, is an excellent example of how
the fact-checkers mislead readers.

The graph below, which has been previously

displayed, shows a classic dose-response relationship
between increased vaccine doses and increased COVID
infection.

Fact-checkers here appeal to their favourite

misdirection-play, claiming as usual that ‘correlation is
not causation’, all the while ignoring the fact that a very
evident and marked dose-response relationship is a
strong pointer towards the vaccines causing increased
infections.

They then go on to say that the authors of the study

do not make conclusions about causation, and that
they affirm that the vaccine has a noticeable short-term
positive effect, all the while ignoring that the study
could not have survived the censorship process amongst
the medical journals if they had said anything about the
dose-response relationship.

While seeking out the linked URLs for this document

to ensure its evidenced rigour, this writer was stunned
at the exponential growth of bogus fact-checker articles
all appearing at the top of each search - even in Duck
Duck Go, the ostensibly non-exploitative search engine
I use before resorting to Google if all else fails. All factcheckers use the same armory of specious reasonings
and rationales to play on the minds of readers unable to
deconstruct their strategies.
