To whom it may concern,

I am wri�ng to express my strong opposi�on to the proposed Communica�ons Legisla�on
Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023. While I understand the
importance of addressing the spread of misinforma�on and disinforma�on on digital pla�orms, I
firmly believe that the measures outlined in this bill pose a significant threat to the fundamental
principles of free speech and democracy in Australia.

The provisions in the bill that grant the government the power to gather informa�on from digital
pla�orm providers and require them to keep certain records infringe upon the privacy rights of
individuals and introduce a level of government surveillance that raises legi�mate concerns.
Addi�onally, the government's ability to request the development of a code of prac�ce and enforce
an industry standard encroaches on the autonomy of digital pla�orms and risks s�fling innova�on
and compe��on in the online space.

At the heart of my opposi�on lies the belief that this bill undermines the essence of free speech, a
cornerstone of any democra�c society. The Australian Cons�tu�on only recognizes an implied right
to freedom of speech, and by targe�ng the pla�orms ci�zens use to express their views and share
informa�on, the government is indirectly limi�ng ci�zens' ability to exercise this right freely. This
move could set a dangerous precedent for future encroachments on free expression in other
domains, eroding the very fabric of our democra�c values.

Christopher Hitchens, the renowned Bri�sh-American author and intellectual, once argued
passionately for the necessity of freedom of speech, ‘The only thing that should be upheld at all costs
_and without qualification is the right of free expression, because if that goes, then so do all other_
_claims of right as well’._

Democracy cannot exist where freedom of speech is curtailed. The ability to openly express ideas,
cri�que authority, and engage in robust debates are vital elements that nourish a healthy democracy.
By giving the government the power to censor and control informa�on on digital pla�orms, we risk
jeopardizing the diversity of opinions and perspec�ves that are essen�al for informed decisionmaking and the advancement of society.

Furthermore, gran�ng the government or a commitee the role of an arbiter of truth is a deeply
troubling prospect. It concentrates enormous power in the hands of a few, enabling them to define
what cons�tutes misinforma�on and disinforma�on. Such subjec�ve determina�on is inherently
prone to biases and may lead to the silencing of dissen�ng voices, hindering necessary cri�cism of
government policies and ac�ons.

Instead of relying on heavy-handed regula�on that may uninten�onally suppress free expression, I
urge the government to invest in public educa�on and media literacy ini�a�ves. By promo�ng cri�cal
thinking and empowering ci�zens to discern reliable informa�on, we can combat misinforma�on and
disinforma�on at their root, without sacrificing our cherished principles of free speech.

In conclusion, I implore you to reconsider the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng
Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023. While I acknowledge the importance of addressing the
challenges posed by misinforma�on and disinforma�on, the proposed measures threaten the
bedrock of our democracy—freedom of speech. Let us work together to find alterna�ve solu�ons
that uphold our democra�c values while fostering a more informed and responsible digital society.

Thank you for considering my concerns. I hope that you will give this mater the careful considera�on
it deserves.
