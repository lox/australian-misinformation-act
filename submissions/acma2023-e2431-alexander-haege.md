Submission on the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 18/8/2023

I would take immediate issue with your preamble on your website.
Misinformation and disinformation, what we used to call lies, does not, in my
opinion, pose as large a threat to our Australian way of life, safety and
wellbeing, as does the censorship and government control you propose.

We are all aware of the malign influence of 'Big Brother'. And in this case
the governments proposed cure, is worse than the disease. Lies can be
countered by the truth. Propaganda can be exposed by a vigorous media and
by social media, combined with a good liberal education.

Censorship of a person's free speech is an intolerable infringement on
the rights of a citizen in a democratic Australia.

The very simple solution to lies and untruths in the online world and in
general, is that you must put your name to your comments or your 'published'
opinions. You have to be held responsible for your words and be prepared to
defend your opinions with logical argument.

This is already done with letters to the newspapers and comments made
by people who do not hide behind anonymous domain names on the internet.
Ban 'publication' of such writings, and thereby fix the problem immediately.
Personal responsibility is missing in much of our public life on the internet.
