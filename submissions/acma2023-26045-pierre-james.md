I am very fearful of the Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation bill, open for
public comment at present. Although I am a staunch supporter of government
attempts to control hate speech, this bill is deficient - if not downright
dangerous. Not only will it styme critical and timely online debate in Australia, but it
will be wholly ineffective against the worst kinds of harmful internet content.

As this bill hopes to protect us from a range of harms, including harm to the
environment, our health, economy and democratic processes, who then decides
what is disinformation about these varied topics?  It is amusing to imagine the
Australian Communications and Media Authority engaging batteries of
meteorologists, climatologists, epidemiologists, economists, political scientists and
other professionals. Day in, day out, our finest intellects in the employ of ACMA
would pore over suspect social media posts and then debate vigorously amongst
themselves before returning judgement. Unfortunately for us, it is unlikely that
ACMA will bother calling upon any professionals, academics or intellectuals in their
pursuit of disinformation. The ultimate arbiters of truth will be either the government
itself or unelected bureaucrats.

Digital media content is to be censored under the bill if it is ‘reasonably likely to
cause or contribute to serious harm’.  Again, without clear and unequivocal
definitions, ‘serious harm’ will be entirely within the eye of the censor.

Social media companies have been with us for nearly twenty years.  Only now has
the Australian government decided that there is a need to censor social media
posts. It would be a far more compelling case if we were provided with examples of
social media disinformation or misinformation harming our economy, environment,
health and so on. After two decades one would expect a plethora of concrete
examples to justify this legislation.  As for the inclusion that ‘harm’ extends even to
environmental harm, we should be satisfied with at least one irrefutable example of a
social media post causing environmental harm anywhere in the entire world at any
time during the whole history of social media. There are none.

Recently, reports have arisen of our government censoring truthful social media
posts during the Covid Pandemic, and it is well-known that senior scientists and
governments around the world censored what is likely to be truthful accounts of the
origins of COVID.  Calls are becoming louder from democratic countries such as the
United States to not only censor what is regarded as ‘Climate Disinformation’, but
also to censor truthful information about the cost of renewables. The Wall Street
Journal reported that the White House national climate advisor stated unequivocally
that ‘highlighting the costs of green energy’ is ‘dangerous’. She demanded that
social media companies censor even truthful posts about the cost.

I strongly urge you to do what you can to quash this bill.  I fear that it will seriously
erode one of the crucial pillars of this great country - our democracy.
