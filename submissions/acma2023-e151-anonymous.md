This new bill is an assault on democracy. Why are governments, who are arguably the worst culprits of disinformation and
misinformation, exempt? I am old enough to make up my own mind with regards to information that is given by any body. I
find it ludicrous that my government feels the need to “protect” me from information, that a group of people with their own
ideas and agendas, deem to be unreliable. Who is policing the thought police? Communism at it’s finest.
