# I strongly object to the proposed misinformation and disinformation bill. It’s deeply disturbing this bill is even proposed. It is a breach of basic human rights, and free speech which is fundamental for a democracy. As citizens we elect politicians to serve us, not to control us by deciding arbitrarily what is true and what isn’t, and shutting down debate. Science without debate is not science. Debate deepens understanding of any topic by enabling all sides to an argument to be heard for people to form their opinions. 

 The government – who proposes to be the arbiter of truth – is guilty of censoring information now known to true, and cancelling expert opinion and facts from social media platforms, including politicians quoting statistics and doing their job representing their electorates. This is not democratic.

# There is absolutely no doubt our government spread misinformation and outright lies about COVID and the COVID injections. What is worse is that this misinformation and lies are allowed to continue on a daily basis with the wilful silence of our so-called “health experts”. Where are they now?


# Here is a short list of some of the misinformation and lies:



# ·   COVID injections are “safe”.



# ·   COVID injections are “vaccines” that prevent infection and transmission of infection.



# ·   COVID injections are 95% effective.



# ·   Paper and cloth masks are effective in preventing COVID infection.



# ·   Young children and adolescents are at significant risk of serious COVID infection.



# ·   The PCR tests are diagnostic for COVID-19 disease.


-----

# ·   COVID injections will prevent serious symptoms of COVID-19.



# ·   Vaccine mandates are needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.



# ·   Transmission of COVID-19 infections is possible from someone who is COVID positive but has no symptoms. 



# ·   Lockdowns are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.



# ·   There is no evidence that gene-based COVID injections can interfere with your own genes.



# ·   Myocarditis and pericarditis is “rare”.



# ·   Heart attack and stroke in adolescents is not rare.



# ·   There are no significant and highly dangerous safety signals regarding the effect the COVID injections are having on fertility and women’s health.

 ·   No child or adolescent in Australia has died as a result of a COVID injection.

 ·   Massive numbers of non-COVID related Excess Deaths (including heart attack, stroke, cancer, diabetes and neurological disease), which have occurred since the COVID injections were introduced, do not warrant investigation.

 ·   Threatening someone with loss of employment if they do not agree to get a COVID injection, is ethical and morally justifiable.

 ·   The Australian Drug Adverse Event Reporting (DAEN) system is a transparent, reliable and effective way of detecting safety signals for the COVID injections.

 ·   Reasonable compensation will be provided to Australians suffering injury and death due to the COVID injections.


-----

# ·   The proposed WHO International Health Regulations will not be binding on Australia to legally enforce lockdowns, forced vaccinations, detentions and travel restrictions in future.


# Where is the empathy, integrity and competence?


# Further:


# 1. Claims that COVID-19 injections reduce illness and death in the elderly is not supported by the evidence when Excess Deaths (deaths from all causes) from both 2021 & 2022 are taken into account. Analysing the Excess Death data using 2021 data alone gives the false impression that the COVID injections are not causing Excess Deaths. Recall “Excess Deaths” are unexpected deaths from all causes above the recent historical average.

 2.     The use of COVID-19 injections in the elderly explain why there are significant numbers of non-COVID excess deaths in this group of vulnerable individuals. The most likely interpretation is that the COVID-19 injections are causing the unexpected rise in deaths.

 3.     With the introduction of the COVID “vaccines” which did not prevent infection or transmission, the definition of a “vaccine” had to be changed. Vaccines no longer are required to prevent disease – they are only required to demonstrate a laboratory immunological response which may mean nothing in terms of clinical efficacy (as we have now seen).

 4.     Independent reanalysis of the original safety data from the COVID injection clinical trials used to permit the use of these experimental drugs showed that safety signals were ignored even at this early stage.

 5.     Official government statistics and reports have been purposely manipulated to produce a favourable impression of the clinical safety and efficacy of the COVID injections. A number of techniques were used to do this including altering definitions of “vaccine status”, arbitrary classification or certification of a “COVID death” without credible supporting evidence and use of highly amplified PCR tests (which are not diagnostic for disease) to artificially inflate the numbers of people infected.


-----

# 6.    Using 2021 & 2022 data, shows Excess Deaths in the elderly were likely caused by COVID-19 injections administered five months earlier.  The same applies for the entire population.

 7.       2020 there were no significant Excess Deaths – by definition there was no pandemic in 2020.

 8.       The statistical signal for the rise in deaths in the younger age groups appears to have been masked by the larger number of deaths in the other age groups.

 9.       Historically, the elderly (75+ years) normally account for about 66% of annual deaths but in 2022 following intensive injection and booster campaigns, they represented 82% of all deaths. The high statistical significance of this result is very clear. COVID-19 injections “accelerated the mortality rates of the Australian elderly”. We know from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the majority of Excess Deaths are non-COVID related deaths.

 These statistics are staggering and should lead to a Royal Commission into the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s Provisional approval and release of the COVID-19 injections and the continued claims of safety and efficacy for these gene-based injections which have led to the highest incidence of death and serious adverse effects of any drug in history.

 On the basis of this disaster, fuelled by the government’s misinformation and disinformation, it is clear this Bill must not proceed.
