Freedom of speech is a fundamental pillar of democracy. In 2011 I had an adverse reaction to
the h1n1 vaccine. Many vaccines are unsafe and antivirals can be a better option. So we don't
need George Orwell's ministry of truth confabulating dis-information and mis-information. In a
democracy we can use our critical thinking and research to reach our own conclusions.
Otherwise we may as well all go and live in communist China. Think about it.
