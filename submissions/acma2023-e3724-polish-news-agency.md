### It should be made public

## My opinion:

I think that Australia is undoubtfully a fascist country and its political
## system is the dystopian totalitarianism. It is a kind of capitalist North Korea. I do not care what You will decide upon Your plans to censor like the communists censored news in my home country in the past.

I wanted to say that the former British Empire is nowadays a group
## of totalitarian countries that try to censor news according to their biased belief systems such as for example scientific materialism which is a religious sect that spreads quickly nowadays. Yours faithfully Adam
