# Submission on the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 (Cth)

## The below comments relate to clauses within Schedule 1 of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, according to their descriptors in the Exposure Draft

Clause 2 – definitions
There is no need to include “misinformation” that may concern the natural environment, as
a statement about climate change could not have the immediate gravity of a statement
inciting terrorism or other dangerous behaviour.

Clause 7
The exemption of government publications is concerning, as it allows the government to say
whatever it pleases, while abrogating the equivalent rights of opposition politicians and
ordinary members of the public.
Further, the definition of “harm” is also concerning, as what is and is not “harm” or “serious
harm” is a purely subjective consideration. Though measures have been taken to define
“harm” in clause 2, what is contained in the definition of “harm” is insufficient. One person’s
hate speech may be another person’s truth-telling. The government must be careful not to
endow itself or the ACMA with the function of arbiter of truth in this way. There is an
obvious role where, for example, there are comments on social media attempting to incite
violence against a particular group on the basis of obvious misinformation, but this does not
apply in all situations contemplated by the definition of “harm” and the operative provision
that is clause 7.
Considering that the purpose of the Bill is to prevent misinformation and disinformation,
one questions the relevance of “hatred” towards certain peoples, and “harm” to the
environment. As comments within these spheres are likely to be expressions of opinion, one
questions whether they can be properly considered “misinformation” in any way.

Relatedly, I am glad that clause 6(1) excludes services that enable communication that is
exclusively private, as such information must be kept private.

Clauses 14(3) and 18(4)
Very important – the government must keep a balance between protection and privacy.
While it is crucial to ensure the protection of the Australian community, the privacy of
messages in confidence must be maintained.

Clauses 18(3)(d) and 19(3)(d)
Concerns around clauses 18(3)(d) and 19(3)(d), as it would be dangerous to force a person
to give up their documents without any due process or hurdle for ACMA authorities to
overcome. Again, the privacy and dignity of the individual is essential. There should be a
stronger proviso than that provided in clauses 18(1)(a) and 19(1)(a), which makes explicit
reference to what must be satisfied for ACMA to be permitted to request these documents.

Clause 21(2)


-----

Very important, as the common law presumption of innocence has been fiercely attacked by
some State legislatures throughout this century, and we ought not see another incursion
against this common law right. Accordingly, clause 21(2) must be maintained if clause 21 is
to form part of the intended legislation.

Clause 24
Clause 24, in permitting the ACMA to take and retain possession of original documents
indefinitely, goes too far. There ought to be a time constraint on possession, perhaps
somewhere in the range of 3 to 5 years.

Clause 27 is of crucial importance and ought to be retained in the Bill.

Clause 32 is somewhat concerning as, in conjunction with the ambiguous definitions of
misinformation and disinformation, may allow relevant bodies to make codes that may
discriminate against certain groups or assess certain language as being misinformation by
default.

Clauses 34 and 35 are, again, of crucial importance.

Clause 40
This clause, particularly sub-clause (1)(d), is very important. To restrict the implied freedom
of political communication would be to breach the Constitution itself, and the ACMA must
ensure that misinformation codes do not unreasonably burden this implied freedom.
However, the right given to ACMA to consider “any circumstances the ACMA considers
relevant” is concerning as it allows the ACMA discretion to consider any or no circumstances
that may be of substantial importance in the case of the particular code/industry. This
aspect of clause 40(1)(d) ought to be reconsidered, in order for the scope of the ACMA’s
discretion to be more greatly specified. Similarly, the limitation on the making of standards
under Division 5, as set out in clause 45, must be likewise more specific in the scope of
ACMA’s discretion.
Alternatively, clause 40(1)(d) and clause 45 should provide a list of matters or circumstances
to consider, either as an obligation or as a guide. There should be some base-level
requirement that the most important elements of the implied freedom be considered in any
balancing exercise.

Clause 40(2) ought to be altered to extend the minimum period to “at least 60 days”, or a
longer period. In the digital realm, such matters can appear only fleetingly, if at all, and the
Australian public, but more specifically representative of the industry, should be given
adequate time to become aware of chances for submissions.

Clause 55(4) is of crucial importance. In order for our society to be subject to the rule of law,
it is essential that our laws, including “misinformation codes” and “misinformation
standards”, be accessible.

Clause 60 provided the writer with a welcome sigh of relief, though there should be some
sort of redress or “easy” ability for the instruments identified in clause 60(1) to be
contested. This mechanism should form part of the Schedule itself.
