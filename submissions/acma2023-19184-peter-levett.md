Submission by Peter Levett

I am totally opposed to ACMA or government or anyone else policing or fining or influencing social
media or other forms of media for misinformation or disinformation. I want to hear what everyone
has to say and then make my own mind up about what is the truth.

I want freedom to be able to express my own opinion without fear of a hefty fine. I totally support
freedom of speech. To take away freedom of speech leads to dictatorship where someone else tells
you what to think, what you can say and what you can do. I do not want Australia to be a place which
lacks freedom. I do not want this.

I am a scientist at heart and I like hear all the evidence. Once you restrict information it is no longer
true science.

I do not believe ACMA or any other group of government officials is so superior to everyone else that
they will always correctly determine the whole truth, be free of bias and not allow their ideology to
influence their determinations.

Please do not try to control what information I can find.
