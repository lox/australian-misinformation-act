There should be no new powers for ACMA to combat misinformation and disinformation because it can lead to loss of
**freedom of speech, similar to the suppression of speech which happens in Communist countries where any criticism of the**
government is misinformation and disinformation.

If the Government is exempt from fines, then this shows they are not confident that they may engage in
misinformation/disinformation themselves, whether intentionally or unintentionally. If you fine or incentivise the removal of content
from internet platforms of those who call out the government misinformation or Climate Activist disinformation, then you make the
damage/harm done by this government disinformation or by activists worse, as dissent will be removed, even if true because they
don't want to risk fines of millions of dollars. The fact there is no appeal for the person posting the information, means the
chances of suppression of free speech is even greater, and no chance to learn from mistakes.

For example: If we look at the origins of COVD-19 coming from a lab in Wuhan was labelled as misinformation by Facebook
and it was removed from their platform (with encouragement from FBI and the government). We now know that this was not
misinformation, and it delayed the actions of stopping funding of gainer function research in China, where safety concerns in their
labs were raised many times. This action by Facebook increased the risk of harm to people in Australia from another virus
outbreak, as it only allowed for wet market origin and not the lab leak.

Tim Flannery said on ABC Landline 11 Feb 2007,"that even the rain that falls in Australia will not fill our dams and river
systems". This was in fact misinformation, which led to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide building expensive Desalination
plants (the plant in Melbourne cost $3.5B alone not to mention ongoing maintenance cost).

This misinformation will not be removed by Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc because it is deemed to help the environment, or
help people access water supply, even though it was false as dams in these cities are currently 90+% full. The money spent on
desalination plants should have been spent on aboriginal welfare, hospitals, flood mitigation, aged care and schools where the
need is real.

Misallocation of resources can be argued to cause harm to people vs imagined benefit - how would internet platforms judge
**competing harms little alone ACMA. If someone posted that Tim Flannery statement was wrong at the time, under these**
proposed powers that contrary statement could/would be removed as misinformation /disinformation as it could be argued simply
that it hurts the environment. The real harm in misallocation of public money is ignored.

There have been other cases we have seen what is labelled as disinformation/misinformation later to found to be true:

- The New York Post was locked out of Twitter for 10 days, during a presidential election because its story on Hunter Biden
laptop was labelled as Russian disinformation by 50 former heads of intelligence and Twitter used hacked materials policy to
censure the story and stop sharing this information. Turns out all these people and Twitter were wrong. The Laptop and
information on it really was Hunter Bidens, but the damage had been done as information was suppressed/censured from the
Twitter and Facebook leading up to people casting their vote. Under the proposed bill there is no fines for falsely labelling
**misinformation/ disinformation and banning posts therefore freedom of speech is at risk.**

- Greta Thunberg's tweet, which was shared on 21 June, 2018, but has since been deleted by her, read “A top
climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels
over the next five years.” - This is clearly misinformation/disinformation, but would not be deleted under the
proposed law because it helps the environment, but clearly they ignore the harm done through stress, anxiety
and depression it causes to school children who believe what Greta says. We have heard some people say, they

depressed about the end of the world caused by climate change.

- A 2009 comment by former U.S. vice president Al Gore - "The North Pole will be ice-free in the summer by
2013 because of man-made global warming,” . This quote attributed to Gore in a social media post is clearly
misinformation but is allowed to remain because it helps the environment while harming people who believe "sea
levels will rise 20 feet" (from an 2006 film an Inconvenient Truth which was/is shown in schools as education
material exempt from this bill). A fact check shows, since 1880, the global sea level has risen 8-9 inches and,
between 1993-2021, the sea level has ticked up 3.8 inches, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). At that rate, it would take approximately 1,136 years for the world's sea level to rise 20
feet.

Again it is unlikely that ACMA would fine internet companies for Greta and Al Gore's misinformation post, (it
helps the environment/ignoring the impact on people who believe it) so it remains up, while internet companies
would readily remove any posts that say this impact of climate change is exaggerated (because it hurts the
environment/ignoring the fact it minimises the harm the people, because it removes fear and anxiety).

**I do not believe that ACMA and the Internet platforms, have the time or resources to accurately weigh**
**up how much of any post (millions of these each day) is misinformation/ disinformation, and**
**competing harms that it does to people or the environment, therefore they would just blanket ban**
**anything they think may incur a fine.**

What's worse is that a post may contain 25 statements that are accurate and helpful information but if there was
just one statement that was deemed misinformation or harmful then the whole post is removed. This means
**platforms would no longer put a comment, or warning or fact check they would just remove the entire post**
to avoid a fine.

Even worse, this legislation could be used as an excuse to ban speech the platform or people doing the
censoring dont' like - they could simply label it harmful or hate speech. There are no fines for removing too
**much content which does not fit the definitions in the bill which means there are no protections of free**
**speech. We therefore will end up like China, censuring anything the government or internet platform doesn't like.**

The alternative is that we leave it to the people of Australia, to make up their own minds, about what is true and
what is false and what is harmful and what is not. After all this is why we have a compulsory education system in
Australia, so people can make informed choices about what they want to read, and what arguments they believe
have merit and which do not.
