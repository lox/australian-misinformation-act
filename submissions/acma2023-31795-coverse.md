**RE: COVERSE submission on the Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment**

**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023[1]**

Dear Minister,

We are the national peak body representing Australians who have been adversely impacted by
COVID-19 vaccines.[2] We are 100% controlled and operated by pro-vaccine COVID-19
vaccine-injured Australians, and are a charity registered with the Australian Charities and
Not-for-profits Commission.[3]

Within the context of the proposed new legislation Communications Legislation Amendment
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, we draw your attention to the significant_
harms that existing government and corporate misinformation policies have had, and continue to
have, on the many thousands of Australians who have been seriously injured as a result of their
COVID-19 vaccinations.

In this submission we will detail these harms - harms that real people have experienced as a direct
result of these suppression efforts - the types of harms that the new bill explicitly states that it
seeks to mitigate but will only serve to further inflict onto Australian citizens.

For details about the overall situation being faced by COVID-19 vaccine-injured Australians see
our submission (attached) to Parliament’s Inquiry into Long Covid and Repeated Covid Infections.[4]

# Dispelling myths

Before we detail specific harms that have been inflicted upon the community of vaccine-injured
Australians, it may be helpful to dispel a number of myths around vaccine harms that many
experts, officials, governments and social media organisations have perpetuated.

**_Myth #1: Serious adverse events are rare, mild and short lived_**

Despite strong Government messaging that serious adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations
are mild and short lived, many of our injured community have been suffering severe, debilitating
symptoms for over 18 months, often without clear diagnoses. Data collected from our injured
members shows that the average amount of time to notice any improvement in symptom severity is
more than 6 months.

An important study that sought to analyse the combined clinical trial data for both and
’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccines indicated that the overall rate of serious adverse events
may be alarmingly high, at 1 per 800 people.[5] This study collected all serious adverse events, and
compared this collection with the overall rate of serious events in the background population.

Both pharmaceutical corporations and government drug regulators never present data in this way.
They only consider the rate of individual health conditions. In most instances, this rate is quite low,
and often the numbers are so low as to be deemed statistically insignificant, and therefore they
claim that there is no increased risk of these individual adverse outcomes.

However, when a lot of serious, but rare, adverse events are added up and compared with the
overall background rate, the picture that emerges may be quite different from what official sources
convey.[6]

In addition to this, a recent research letter from Hong Kong demonstrates that of the cases of
young males who had experienced myocarditis as a result of their mRNA vaccinations, a
significant proportion continued to demonstrate cardiac issues at a 1 year follow-up.[7] This study’s
findings are very much in line with what we are witnessing within patient support groups - that
patients continue to experience health challenges, with very few indicating that they have returned
to full health.

**_Myth #2: Myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare, and appear primarily in young males_**

Throughout the vaccine rollout the persistent messaging from both Government and media was
that the serious cardiac conditions of myocarditis and pericarditis were a very rare risk, primarily in
young men. This messaging led many in the medical community to blatantly disregard women
presenting with cardiac symptoms post their COVID-19 vaccination.

We have many reported examples where middle-aged women were told they had anxiety and were
advised to seek psychological evaluation and assistance. After months of cardiac injury
presentations these women were eventually identified as having post-vaccination myocarditis or

pericarditis, and this delay in treatment has caused further damage. Additionally, our community
data indicates that more than 55% of those diagnosed with pericarditis and over 50% of those
diagnosed with myocarditis are female, demonstrating that for many Australian women the
Government and media messaging was both misleading and negligent.

This patient experience is reflected in a recent study from Switzerland that found that myocardial
injuries (including myocarditis) may actually be occurring at an alarmingly higher rate than
previously disclosed, and that women appear to make up a significant (if not the majority) of these
cases.[8]

**_Myth #3: Coincidence is not causality_**

One of the first go-to rebuttals towards someone who declares they have been injured by a
COVID-19 vaccine is the condescending phrase “coincidence is not causality”. This is in reference
to the fact that in cases of vaccine injuries, direct evidence of the harm being caused by the
vaccine is only rarely available, and that in some instances an individual’s health event would have
occurred regardless of their vaccination.

However, what such a comment fails to recognize is that in drug safety examinations, coincidence
is the first sign that an individual has experienced a health event caused by their vaccination, and
warrants further investigation. In many cases, not only does the patient consult a number of
physicians and specialists, but no other plausible explanation can be found. In such cases,
coincidence is indeed a very strong indicator of harm caused by vaccination.

Nevertheless, the phase “coincidence is not causality” has been so widely propagated - by public
health officials, ministers, and the media - that many medical professionals succumb to this
paradigm, and their very first response is that “the vaccine can’t cause that”, rather than “this
concerning coincidence must be explored”.

Sadly, in too many instances social media used this paradigm (coincidence is not causality) to
deem many claims of vaccine injury as misinformation without any efforts to ascertain any facts.

# Targeting of unpopular facts and personal truths have serious consequences

Our organisation is fully aware that misinformation and disinformation, broadly speaking, and in
very particular instances, can have negative consequences for the community and for individuals,
and therefore we do understand efforts that attempt to minimise the potential for these harms and
the well-meaning sentiments with which this legislation has been written.

However, we are also too well aware, through the experiences of the majority of COVID-19
vaccine-injured Australians, that the current practices of censorship are quite literally disabling,
indebting and abandoning our fellow Australians.

Over the last three years, censorship carried out by the media, educational institutions, social
media and digital platforms in response to government COVID-19 policies have already caused
extreme and ongoing harm to COVID-19 vaccine-injured Australians as they attempt to obtain
proper medical information and care, treatment, peer support and compensation,.

Due to the censorship of emerging peer-reviewed scientific research and legitimate investigative
journalism on COVID-19 vaccine harms, our community has been prevented from finding medical
help and treatment. Furthermore, false claims provided by the Government (for example that our
serious reactions are ‘self-limiting’) have hindered proactive action by treating physicians, and have
been therefore damaging to our health and to public health.

Perhaps most alarmingly, in the context of receiving such limited assistance from the Australian
government and medical establishments, is that most of us have even been prevented from
sharing our personal stories, and from gaining mental and peer support from social networks,
because of social media censorship, again under the spurious claim that our personal stories are
misinformation that would be damaging to public health.

The increase of, and normalisation of these powers, and the provision of additional reserve
powers, will not protect vaccine-injured Australians from harm, as the bill is intended. It will instead
increase our vulnerability and harm our health, which is in direct contradiction to the purpose of the
bill.

## Arbitrary and harmful definitions of misinformation

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media companies have purposefully designed their
community standards to reflect official government positions.

These standards deferred to mere declarations from government and public health agencies, and
did not reflect on the scientific method, disallowing:

  - Emerging science

  - Contentious yet valid science

  - Minority yet scientifically valid opinions.

This approach has classed many important scientific facts and opinions as misinformation and
harmful to the community - a significant volume of which has subsequently become the consensus
view or at least validated as reasonable. For example, claims that the antigen (the “spike” protein)
from the COVID-19 vaccines may persist in the body were deemed to be misinformation. However,
a number of scientific studies have reported the presence of this antigen within patients up to 6

4


-----

months after their vaccinations, and even the Centres of Disease Control (CDC) in the USA quietly
removed its guidance that claimed that this antigen is only short-lived in the human body.[9]

These community standards were further weaponised by the Australian Government (and other
governments around the world), who flagged content to social media providers that they preferred
not be allowed to circulate. Whilst some of this content was of an extreme nature (e.g. advocating
criminal behaviour), some of this content was factually correct or was later shown to be factually
correct (for example, that the COVID-19 vaccines did not prevent transmission or infection).[10]

Of particular concern to our organisation and community is the censoring of scientific and medical
information surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 vaccine harms, and stories related to
these issues.

There are many aspects of the censorship of information around COVID-19 vaccines, and
amplification of Government approved messaging, that have created harm to large numbers of
Australians (below we articulate specific situations that many members of our community have
experienced, and the harms these have created).

What is extraordinary about these harms is that despite the best intentions (assuming that indeed it
has been “best intentions” at play) of governments and social media corporations, their very
actions targeting misinformation have directly led to substantial harm. This situation is a
demonstration that even with all of the best intentions in the world, there will invariably be innocent
citizens who suffer significant harm as a result of these actions.

In short, definitions of misinformation, no matter how well they may be formulated, will never be
able to avoid serious collateral damage to the community. And neither governments nor private
sector actors (such as social media companies) have demonstrated that they can be trusted to
avoid these collateral damages or be subject to any consequences for causing these harms.[11]

Worse still, as is demonstrated by our situation, these harms were inflicted upon people who were
already suffering serious health consequences caused by their willingness to support the
Government program of COVID-19 vaccination.

## Censorship of information about potential COVID-19 vaccine harms

Since Australia’s vaccine rollout was somewhat delayed compared to other major western
countries, we might expect that information about the experiences in those countries, particularly in
relation to vaccine harms, might form part of Australia’s information campaign.

Sadly, Government efforts to minimise such information, and social media’s obedience to oblige
this, meant that information that was shared regarding negative experiences of overseas rollout
campaigns was highly censored in Australia.

Relevant information about potential serious side-effects, diagnostics, and treatments were all
deliberately withheld from the general Australian public by not allowing private citizens to share this
information on social media.

any sort of due process, to censor what ultimately turned out to be factual content.

-----

Australians who experienced serious vaccine side effects found themselves in an information
vacuum, with only sparse information able to be accessed on potential side-effects and treatments.

The provision of the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme demonstrates the Government’s
acknowledgement of at least a small fraction of the serious and long-term adverse consequences
of COVID-19 vaccinations.[12] However, it also appears that this scheme has been deliberately
designed to allow for further minimisation of the broader harms caused by these vaccine products,
as the majority of vaccine-injured Australians do not currently qualify.

## Uninformed medical staff

When medical treatment was sought, in many cases medical staff had no access to meaningful
guidelines about the reactions being caused by the COVID-19 vaccines and were unaware of how
to identify symptoms as a COVID-19 vaccine injury, due to the censorship of any public discussion
of COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions.

In some rare situations where they were able to recognise reactions as serious issues, however
they often did not know how to effectively treat these issues due to a lack of information accessible
to them.

To be clear, protocols for the treatment of COVID-19 vaccine injuries were being developed by
doctors and researchers around the world at this time. However, they were not being developed in
Australia (and there are still no public, national, accessible guidelines for GPs or patients about
how to identify or treat many COVID-19 vaccine reaction outcomes).

Sadly, early treatment could have enabled many vaccine-injured Australians to recover more
quickly, reducing the long-term harms to the community. Censorship of important cutting-edge
information got in the way of this.

This situation was compounded by actions from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation
Agency (Ahpra), which issued a threat to all medical practitioners:

“Any promotion of anti-vaccination statements or health advice which contradicts the best
available scientific evidence or seeks to actively undermine the national immunisation
campaign (including via social media) is not supported by National Boards and may be in
breach of the codes of conduct and subject to investigation and possible regulatory action.”

        - Ahpra position statement, 9 March 2021

Sadly, what constitutes “best available scientific evidence” is a highly contentious point, and both
social media as well as public health actors defined this as scientific positions communicated by
government agencies. No other valid and well-supported views were allowed to exist on social
media.

And, more importantly, the phrase “seeks to actively undermine the national immunisation
campaign” was a clear signal to all Australian doctors to not only refrain from expressing any valid
concerns or hesitations about the COVID-19 vaccines, but also to not actively investigate or report
suspected patient harms due to these vaccines nor to engage in a balanced and informed
discussion with patients on the potential risks and benefits of these products. This understanding of
Ahpra’s phrasing is often expressed to us (the vaccine-injured) by our treating physicians, and

therefore represents a gross over-reach on the part of the Australian Government to silence
doctors, particularly those who have evidence of vaccine harms right in front of them.

State and federal agencies acted swiftly and brutally to silence any medical practitioner who
expressed valid concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines, or who actively supported vaccine-injured
patients through such actions as providing vaccine exemption certificates, attempting to treat their
complex and perplexing medical conditions with off-label therapeutics, and dared to communicate
any of this with peers or others. While public ridicule and derision of these professionals was
allowed to circulate on social media, their valid and well-supported medical opinions were not.

## Lack of government funded medical research

Trying to find treatment protocols that are based on research coming out of Australia is impossible
because Government funded institutions will not conduct research into vaccine injury for fear of
losing credibility (and funding) by being labelled as misinformation. The atmosphere of censorship
that has been allowed to develop in Australia because of the gagging of public debate around
anything to do with COVID-19 vaccine harms has had a direct effect on our scientific community,
stifling their ability to objectively investigate and examine adverse outcomes from COVID-19
vaccines.

While there are some research efforts happening overseas, anybody who tries to share this
information on social media faces having their posts censored as misinformation.

For example, in July 2023 we posted an image on social media containing the following text: “Over
3000 scientific research papers have delved into the reality of COVID vaccination injury. It’s high
time the Government addresses the pressing issue of finding treatment options that work.”

This was flagged as misinformation by one of the major social media platforms, apparently
contravening its community standards on COVID-19 information. The company provided us with no
opportunity for recourse, and no opportunity to have the post reviewed by a real person. It was
simply censored, and a strike was placed against our account.

This sadly demonstrates that even the sharing of information about the existence of certain
science, without making any reference to the assertions made in those studies, is being deemed
misinformation.

7


-----

This censorship of relevant peer-reviewed scientific information has caused further harms to many
vaccine-injured Australians. Faced with, many times, apathetic medical practitioners, many
patients have independently sought to find robust scientific information by themselves, only to
discover that much discussion of such information has been censored on the very platforms that
are familiar to them for finding helpful content, including social media and search engines. While
studies do exist, and oftentimes contain descriptions of potential treatments, the deliberate actions
of governments and social media corporations to limit the visibility of this information has caused
direct harm to Australians by curtailing their ability to find medical and scientific answers and
treatments.

## Deplatforming of individuals and support groups

Many citizens who have experienced serious vaccine reactions have attempted to speak out about
their conditions to both inform their family and friends about their situation and to publicly highlight
the appalling situation that many find themselves in and advocate for better awareness and
support.

The mere act of doing this - which is normal and acceptable for patients who experience any other
crippling medical condition - has attracted significant government and social media scrutiny. If
these patients' accounts are not subsequently cancelled, their posts are at the very least censored
or shadow-banned (the practice of reducing the visibility of their content to other users).

In March 2023, COVERSE put together a series of short videos for International Women’s Day,
which, in their own words, highlighted the struggles being faced by vaccine-injured Australian
women.[13] On one of the major social media video platforms all but one of these videos was
removed for violating “Community Guidelines” despite these videos conveying real stories and real
experiences.

Many vaccine-injured citizens have had their social media accounts completely cancelled, with
social media companies citing breaches of nebulous “community guidelines”, “contradicting public
health advice”, or “presenting a harm to the public” - despite these citizens doing little more that
telling their own stories and sharing relevant information as it relates to their situation, again
behaviour that is acceptable for those suffering from illnesses like cancer .

The cancelling of accounts in this manner - a practice known as “deplatforming” as it denies the
user further access to the social media platform - inflicts further harm to these already injured
individuals as it cuts off an important avenue of social support and community connection.

This practice of silencing vaccine injured citizens also extends to organised online support groups.
Vaccine injured users have sought to create safe spaces to discuss their injuries and to support
one-another. This is a common practice amongst groups of people suffering from other medical
conditions, and social media support groups abound for conditions such as allergies, cancer, heart
disease, diabetes, dementia, etc. However, social media companies (often at the behest of
governments) have actively sought out and removed support groups for vaccine-injured users.

As often their only connection to a compassionate and understanding group who are struggling
with the same condition, this obscene act on the part of social media companies destroyed what
little hope many of these people had left, and through our community networks we are aware that
in a number of instances this has contributed significantly to individuals’ decisions to take their own
lives.

As far as we are aware, there are no other health conditions where users and their support groups
are being deplatformed in these ways, nor would it be acceptable.

As a result, the culture around many vaccine injury support groups has evolved to use code words
to describe their situation, in an attempt to evade deplatforming by social media companies. This
was disgracefully highlighted by the BBC in September 2022, who also stooped to incorrectly
labelling these groups as anti-vax groups.[14]

All of this has also made it significantly harder for patients to find appropriate online support, as
(particularly during the first two years of the vaccine rollout) groups were routinely removed by
social media companies, and those that remained used obscure language in order to protect their
communities from this censorship.

## Government misinformation

Since critical public discussion of the COVID-19 vaccines was censored, and only the official “safe
& effective” messaging was allowed to be shared online, known and potential risks of these
vaccines were suppressed, even though many serious reactions were identified long before
governments officially recognised them.

Still today, there are many adverse reactions that have been documented in peer-review literature,
and widely acknowledged by clinicians as being linked to the COVID-19 vaccines, however the
Government has not relayed these potential adverse reactions to the Australian public. This
includes conditions such as deafness, blindness, dysautonomia, small fibre neuropathy (SFN),
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), tinnitus, chronic headaches/migraines,
and others.[15]

This environment led many citizens to believe that the vaccines would be safe for them, and that
they would be well looked after if something adverse happened. This has turned out to not be the
case. The Government and social media actors are still perpetuating actual misinformation about
the real risks associated with these vaccines, which is directly leading to more Australians
becoming seriously injured by them.

Censorship of all messaging other than official Government claims of vaccine safety is directly
responsible for many people’s decision to get vaccinated. In the past, patients were able to have a

measured conversation with their doctors in order to help inform their decision on whether to get
vaccinated or not. However, the censoring of all non-Government information, along with threats
against doctors by government regulators (as detailed above), has circumvented this important
doctor-patient dialogue, and has caused significant harm in too many instances. The Government
and social media organisations must take responsibility for this harm, and any and all efforts that
have the effect to maintain this environment will only ensure that more Australians will be harmed
as a direct result of this official misinformation.

# Conclusion & recommendations

As stated, our organisation has been founded by pro-vaccine vaccine-injured Australians. Within
the current framework of government and social media controlled and tightly defined parameters
regarding COVID-19 vaccine information, our community has been largely abandoned, and the
organisations that claim to be addressing misinformation have targeted our community in ways that
have resulted in real and devastating harms.

If this overall situation, that has caused and is still causing harms to many Australians, can occur
within the current legislative and industry frameworks, surely this is a red flag that further tightening
of this legislative environment is only going to create more innocent and unintended victims, not
only on this issue but on any issue that authorities and consensus groups determine they don’t
want discussed in public.

**It is our recommendation that all efforts (including this bill) that serve to censor or hide**
**unpopular views, regardless of perceived basis in fact or consensus positions, be**
**abandoned.**
