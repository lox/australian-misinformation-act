Freedom of speech is fundamental to our democracy, and this new bill the government is
proposing is a blatant attack on our free speech and goes well beyond any reasonable
measure.

According to the draft bill, misinformation is defined as unintentionally false, misleading or
deceptive content. It also defines disinformation as misinformation intentionally
disseminated to cause serious harm, but no definition of “serious harm,” is provided despite
it being the relevant trigger for action in the prohibition section. How can we have a
definition that is so vague with so many consequences attached?

Most worrying for me are the claims that government and university academics authorised
information could not be counted as misinformation under the bill, but if you criticise the
Government or Academic, that can be misinformation. So how is it that Government
somehow knows the ‘truth’. We are taught to always question and we learn from
questioning and debating.  Within government and Universities there will be different view
points and there should be, but this legislation is going to choose a side and expect us to
believe their truth, thus stifle debate and the ability to learn. ‘Truth’ changes as we learn,
debate and question. This bill will have the result of individuals not being able to believe
anything or to think anything without getting into trouble and being punished.

Using COVID-19 as an example of how this bill is dangerous, we could look at the recent
claim (different view point backed by science) that COVID-19 vaccines don’t prevent
infection and transmission of the virus. This would be labelled as ‘misinformation’ under the
proposed bill as it would be reasoned, ‘such claims could lead to vaccine hesitancy, putting
lives at risk of serious harm’. The awkward fact is that the so-called ‘misinformation’ was
true. The claim that vaccines stop infection and transmission by government
was itself misinformation but government would not be held accountable, whilst those who
share this viewpoint would be fined for misinformation. It could (and did) lead to vaccinated
people who thought it was impossible to be infected taking less precautions for their own
health and the health of others — in other words, leading to harm to themselves and others.

The best solution to misinformation is free and open debate, supported by a fair media. This
new bill is vague and concerning as it inevitably would stifle political debate and not allow
differing viewpoints to be heard. It is through debate and ongoing critique that once held
beliefs are often changed. We are being told to take the viewpoint of government and this is
a huge overreach of free speech and a huge step backwards in democracy.
