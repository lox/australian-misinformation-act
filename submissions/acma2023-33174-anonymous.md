Our democracy was founded on the principles of free speech and free debate.

Australians should have the right to hear all the arguments         - the good ones and the bad ones         - and
decide for ourselves what's true and what's false.

Politicians and unelected bureaucrats have no place interfering in that process.

The so-called 'fact checkers' already get it wrong all the time. How much worse would the situation

be if ACMA were given an explicit mandate to control free speech?!

I urge you to STOP with this terrible idea.

A single body being charged and empowered with enforcing their own views as the 'truth' is nothing
short of being totalitarian and despotic. The proposal is dangerous, un-Australian and CANNOT be
allowed.

You know that democracy relies on free speech and open debate        - and that more free speech, NOT
censorship, is the best way to handle what you call 'misinformation'.

Australia already has a robust legal framework for dealing with dangerous lies or defamation. We do
not need censorship. Focus instead on educating the masses to consider using a range of sources of
information and to use their own discernment when deciding what is true or false TO THEM. Leave
conversation pathways open. Open and free sharing of information and perspectives is a basic
human right. Please, please do not reduce us to a communism country.

I ask you now to stand up for our democracy and reject the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I implore you to respect our democracy and commit yourself to this country's founding principles:
free speech and free debate.

Stop this authoritarian Bill in its tracks now.

18th August 2023

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Freedom of expression and opinion are the foundation stone for a free and democratic society and a
necessary condition for the promotion and protection of human rights. The real-world impacts of
Covid 19 challenged the Australian Government and sadly the response was at the expense of truth
and commonsense. The Australian Government has pledged to protect and promote traditional
rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, opinion, religion, association and movement. And
yet over the last 3 ½ years this commitment has been broken. To many Australians this has resulted
in a feeling of mistrust and a breakdown in relationship.

February 2021, as the rollout of the Covid 19 vaccine began, former Minister for Health and Aged
Care, Greg Hunt stated “We always have to be aware of the capacity of the virus to mutate and we
have to look at what is called the longevity of the protection with regards to the antibodies that are
developed. The world doesn’t know that answer. The world is engaged in the largest clinical trial,
the largest global vaccination trial ever, and we will have enormous amounts of data. What’s the
message to the public, it’s safe, it’s effective, it will help protect you, but it will also help to protect
your mum and dad, your grandparents, your nonna, all of Australia.”

Despite Greg Hunt indicating that Australians would be participating in a clinical trial, no control
group was identified. A control group is a group of participants in a trial that do not receive the drug
or the treatment being studied. The control group plays a fundamental role in clinical trials as they
serve as a baseline for determining the effectiveness of the study treatment. A clinical trial cannot
be ethically justified unless it can produce scientifically reliable results, which is what a control group
helps to do. The effectiveness of the treatment can be validated if the experimental group has a
better outcome than the control group. Why was a control group not used???

Throughout 2021, with the rollout of Covid 19 vaccinations, the Australian public was bombarded by
the term safe and effective. Words have meaning, the words we choose and the language we use
have the power to affect the people and the world around us.

Safe - 1.: free from harm or risk: unhurt. 2. a.: secure from threat of danger, harm, or loss.

Effective - successful in producing a desired or intended result.

Despite repeated assurances that the vaccines were safe and effective it became apparent that for
some the vaccine was not free from harm or risk and if the desired or intended result was to protect
the vaccinee from infection, severe illness, hospitalisation and death due to Covid 19, well this was
not assured. In fact, it became apparent that misinformation was being used to bolster the
vaccination program and worst of all this was being propagated by government, healthcare
professionals, health bureaucrats and the mainstream media. The public had largely been convinced
that if they received the covid 19 vaccine they would not get covid, they would not pass it onto their
loved ones, but this was not true.

In the months following the vaccine rollout it slowly started to dawn on the public that not all was
well. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions
and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority. Vaccine
hesitancy was not to be tolerated and so freedom to choose was decimated by the introduction of
vaccine mandates.


-----

Harkening back to an earlier statement – words have meaning. In 2021 the following excerpts were
available to the public on the Australian Technical Advisory Group website (see attachments for full
documents) –

**Astra Zeneca Consumer Information**

**Vaxzevria® (previously COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) This vaccine has provisional approval in**
**Australia to protect people aged 18 years and older against COVID-19 disease. The approval has**
**been granted on the basis of short-term efficacy and safety data. Evidence of longer term efficacy**
**and safety from ongoing clinical trials and vaccination in the community continues to be gathered**
**and assessed.**

**5. What should I know about being given VAXZEVRIA?**

**General**

**As with any vaccine, VAXZEVRIA may not protect everyone who is vaccinated from COVID-19. It is**
**not yet known how long people who receive the vaccine will be protected for.**

**Comirnaty Consumer Information**

**COMIRNATY™ COVID-19 VACCINE**

**This approval has been granted on the basis of short term safety and efficacy data. Evidence of**
**longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and vaccination in the community**
**continues to be gathered and assessed.**

**2. What should I know before I am given COMIRNATY?**

**As with any vaccine, COMIRNATY may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known**
**how long you will be protected.**

**The Australian Government – COVID-19 Vaccination (health.gov.au/covid19-vaccines 2)**

**Information on Spikevax (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine**

**Last updated: 15 September 2021**

**Vaccination is voluntary.**

**Benefits of the vaccine**

**No vaccine is 100 percent effective, so it is possible that you can still get infected and sick from**
**COVID-19 after vaccination. We do not know how long the protection from Moderna will last. We**
**will learn more about this over time. We currently do not know exactly how effective COVID-19**
**vaccines are at preventing spread of the virus. This means that even vaccinated people could be**
**infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and even if they have no symptoms or only mild**
**symptoms, they could still pass it on to others. This is why it is important to continue other**
**preventative measures like: • physical distancing • hand washing • wearing a face mask • COVID-**
**19 testing and quarantine/isolation as required by your state/territory. If you have been**
**vaccinated with two doses of Moderna, you should still get a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms**
**that meet testing criteria according to your local health authority (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat).**


-----

**The Australian Government – COVID-19 Vaccination (health.gov.au/covid19-vaccines 2)**

**Information on COVID-19 Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine**

**Last updated: 15 September 2021**

**Vaccination is voluntary and free.**

**Benefits of the vaccine**

**No vaccine is 100 per cent effective, so it is possible that you can still get sick from COVID-19 after**
**vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 could potentially still infect a vaccinated person. Even if they have no**
**symptoms or only mild symptoms, they could still pass it on to others. However, the COVID-19**
**vaccines currently used in Australia is effective in reducing the likelihood of a vaccinated person**
**transmitting the virus to close contacts if the person is infected. This is why after vaccination it is**
**important to continue other preventative measures like: • physical distancing • hand washing**

**• wearing a face mask • COVID-19 testing and quarantine/isolation as required by your**
**state/territory. If you have been vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer, you should still get a COVID-**
**19 test if you have symptoms that meet testing criteria according to your local health authority**
**(e.g. fever, cough, sore throat).**

An experimental vaccination was offered to the public and touted as being safe and effective. If
further information or evidence received is contrary to what is being promoted, it is the obligation of
the promoter to validate the information and not to suppress or conceal this information or
evidence. If the citizens of Australia cannot rely on the government, healthcare professionals, health
bureaucrats and mainstream media to expose the harm done to individuals, then they should not be
exempt from the requirements of this Bill, and in fact should be held to a higher requirement.

If one of the aims of the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 is to prevent harm to the
individual, then it must take into consideration the breach of human rights. In 2021 we saw the
introduction of vaccine mandates. How many people took this vaccine to keep their job? How many
people took the vaccine because they believed that it was safe and effective? How many people
took the vaccine because they believed it would stop them getting covid and spreading it to their
loved ones? How many people took the vaccine without knowing the risks and benefits? How many
took the vaccine because they were scared that they would be mistreated by healthcare workers if
they got sick? Keeping in mind that the vaccines were experimental with no medium- or long-term
safety data, we only need look to the requirements to obtain informed consent to highlight that no
Australian was afforded informed consent.  The Australian Immunisation Handbook states –

**Valid consent is the voluntary agreement by an individual to a proposed procedure, which**
**is given after sufficient, appropriate and reliable information about the procedure,**
**including the potential risks and benefits, has been conveyed to that individual.**

**As part of the consent procedure, people receiving vaccines and/or their parents or carers**
**should be given sufficient information (preferably written) about the risks and benefits of**
**each vaccine. This includes:**

    - **what adverse events are possible**

    - **how common they are**

    - **what they should do about them**

**For consent to be legally valid, the following elements must be present:**


-----

**1.** **It must be given by a person with legal capacity, and of sufficient intellectual capacity**

**to understand the implications of receiving a vaccine.**

**2.** **It must be given voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion or**

**manipulation.**

**3.** **It must cover the specific procedure that is to be performed.**
**4.** **It can only be given after the potential risks and benefits of the relevant vaccine, the**

**risks of not having it, and any alternative options have been explained to the person.**

**The person must have the opportunity to seek more details or explanations about the**
**vaccine or its administration.**

**The information must be provided in a language or by other means that the person can**
**understand. Where appropriate, involve an interpreter or cultural support person.**

**Obtain consent before each vaccination, after establishing that there are no medical**
**condition(s) that contraindicate vaccination. Consent can be verbal or written.**

In 2021 the citizens of Australia were placed under undue pressure, they were coerced and
manipulated and if they did not submit to taking the Covid 19 vaccine they were threatened with
termination of their employment. How many had their employment terminated? How many were
forced to resign their position? How many still to this day have not been able to return to their
chosen professions? Why did this occur? It occurred due to misinformation. The outcome was the
serious harm of individuals who did not, for a variety of reasons, want to undergo an experimental
procedure. People have suffered terribly because of this one decision. Misinformation and
disinformation have had destructive consequences and the people who have perpetrated this against
their fellowman have remained committed to suppressing the truth. Despite the growing evidence
that the vaccines have harmed, injured and caused deaths, the government, healthcare
professionals, health bureaucrats and mainstream media have cruelly deprived their fellowman of
the right to be seen and heard and believed. This Bill should not encroach on freedom of expression.
People should have the right to express their opinions and they should have the ability to tell their
story. The real concern lies with people in positions of authority, who hide behind their credentials
in promoting misinformation and disinformation. If this Bill has no power to arbitrate for truth, then
it should not be amended to impose penalties on digital platforms who may be providing a voice to
those who have been ignored or forgotten. The suppression of information risks silencing protected
speech and has enormous consequences for public debate.

7. Product details


**1. Why am I being given VAXZEVRIA?**


**VAXZEVRIA contains the active ingredient ChAdOx1-S.**
**This vaccine is used to protect people aged 18 years and**
**older against COVID-19.**

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called coronavirus (SARSCoV-2).

VAXZEVRIA stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune
system). It causes the body to produce its own protection
(antibodies) against the virus. This will help to protect you
against COVID-19 in the future. None of the ingredients in
this vaccine can cause COVID-19.


**2. What should I know before I am given**
**VAXZEVRIA**


**Warnings**

**You should not receive VAXZEVRIA if you:**

- Are allergic to this vaccine or any of the ingredients listed
at the end of this leaflet. Always check the ingredients to
make sure you can use this vaccine.

- Have had a major blood clot occurring at the same time
as having low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) after
receiving any COVID-19 vaccine.

- Have had capillary leak syndrome (CLS; a condition
causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels).


**Check with your healthcare provider before vaccination**
**if:**

- You have ever had a severe allergic reaction after
any other vaccine injection or after you were given
VAXZEVRIA in the past;

- Your immune system does not work properly
(immunodeficiency) or are taking medicines that weaken
the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids,
immunosuppressants or cancer medicines);

- You currently have a severe infection with a high
temperature (over 38°C);

- You have ever had a blood clot in the past or if you
have an autoimmune disorder (illness where the body’s
immune system attacks its own cells) including immune
thrombocytopenia (ITP; previously known as idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura);

- You have ever had a serious medical condition (heparin
induced thrombocytopenia; HIT) where your blood
platelet levels became very low (thrombocytopenia) after
taking heparin (a blood thinning medicine)

- You have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you
are taking a blood thinning medicine (anticoagulant);

- You have ever had capillary leak syndrome (CLS; a
condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels)

- You have any other medical conditions

- You take any medicines for any other condition including
any recent or planned vaccines

- You have ever fainted or felt stressed (eg dizziness,
increased heart rate, difficulty in breathing, sweating,
tingling feeling and/or feeling anxious) when you have
been given an injection including other vaccines.

Very rare cases of blood clots with low levels of blood
platelets have been observed following vaccination with
VAXZEVRIA. The majority of these cases occurred within
the first 21 days following vaccination but have also been
reported after this period. Some had a fatal outcome.
Seek urgent medical attention if from a few days following
vaccination you:

- Experience a severe or persistent headache, blurred
vision, confusion or seizures (fits)

- Develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg
pain or persistent abdominal pain

- Notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots
beyond the site of vaccination

After vaccination you may be at risk of developing certain
side effects. It is important you understand these risks and
how to monitor for them. See additional information under
Section 6. Are there any side effects?


-----

Check with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or
breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning
to have a baby. There are limited data on the use of
VAXZEVRIA in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Your
healthcare provider will discuss with you whether you can be
given the vaccine.

**Children and adolescents**

No data are currently available on the use of VAXZEVRIA in
children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.


**5. What should I know about being given**
**VAXZEVRIA?**


**3. What if I am taking, have recently taken or**
**might take other medicines or vaccines?**


Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking, have recently
taken, or might take, any other vaccines or medicines
including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you
buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket
or health food shop.

**Medicines (including other vaccines) that may impact**
**whether you should be given this vaccine or not include**
**the following (see also Section 2 above):**

- medicines that weaken the immune system (such as
high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or
cancer medicines);

- blood thinning medicines (anticoagulant)

- any other vaccine including any other COVID-19
vaccines

**Check with your healthcare provider if you are not**
**sure about what vaccines, medicines, vitamins or**
**supplements you are taking or have recently taken and if**
**these may affect VAXZEVRIA.**


As with any vaccine, VAXZEVRIA may not protect everyone
who is vaccinated from COVID-19. It is not yet known how
long people who receive the vaccine will be protected for.

**Driving or using machines**

**Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools**
**until you know how this vaccine affects you.**

VAXZEVRIA has no known effect on the ability to drive and
use machines. However, side effects listed in section 6 may
impact your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel
unwell, do not drive or use machines.

**Looking after your vaccine**

Your healthcare provider is responsible for storing this
vaccine and disposing of any unused product correctly.


All vaccines can have side effects. If you do experience any
side effects, most of them are mild to moderate in nature and
resolve within a few days. Fewer side effects were reported
after the second dose However, some side effects may need
medical attention.

After vaccination, you may have more than one side effect
at the same time (for example, muscle pain/ache, joint pain,
headaches, chills and generally feeling unwell).

See the information below and, if you need to, ask your
healthcare provider if you have any further questions about
side effects.


**6. Are there any side effects?**


**4. How am I given VAXZEVRIA?**


**How VAXZEVRIA is given**

VAXZEVRIA will be given to you by a healthcare provider. It
is injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).

**You will receive 2 (0.5 mL per dose) injections. You**
**will be told when you need to return for your second**
**injection of VAXZEVRIA.**

The second injection can be given between 4 and 12 weeks
after the first injection.

When VAXZEVRIA is given for the first injection, VAXZEVRIA
(and not another vaccine against COVID-19) should be given
for the second injection to complete vaccination course.

**If you forget to get your second injection**

If you forget to go back at the scheduled time, ask your
healthcare provider for advice. It is important that you return
for your second injection of VAXZEVRIA. If you miss a
scheduled second injection you may not achieve maximum
protection.

**If you use too much VAXZEVRIA**

As VAXZEVRIA is given under the close supervision of a
healthcare provider it is unlikely that you will be given too
much.

If you are concerned that you have been given too much
VAXZEVRIA, tell your healthcare provider immediately.

how to monitor for them. See additional information under
Section 6. Are there any side effects?

Very rare cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart
muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside
the heart) have been reported after vaccination with
COMIRNATY. The cases have mostly occurred within
two weeks following vaccination, more often after the
second vaccination, and more often occurred in younger
men. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs
of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness,
palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical
attention should these occur.

You may develop a temporary, stress-related response
associated with the process of receiving your injection. This
may include dizziness, fainting, sweating, increased heart
rate and/or anxiety. If you start to feel faint at any time during
the process of receiving your injection, let your doctor, nurse
or pharmacist know and take actions to avoid falling and
injuring yourself, such as sitting or lying down.

# Information on Spikevax (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine

Last updated: 15 September 2021

#### About the vaccine

**Moderna is a vaccine that can prevent people from becoming ill from COVID-19. Two doses**
are required, usually given 4-6 weeks apart (in special circumstances the interval may be
longer). The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any live virus, and it cannot give you
COVID-19. It contains the genetic code for an important part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called
the spike protein. After getting the vaccine, your body makes copies of the spike protein. Your
immune system will then learn to recognise and fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
causes COVID-19. The genetic code is broken down quickly by the body.

To prevent COVID-19, everyone who is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine should get vaccinated,
with a few exceptions specified in this information sheet. Vaccination is voluntary. You can
discuss any concerns or questions you have about COVID-19 vaccination with your
immunisation provider and/or your GP before you receive the vaccine.

#### Benefits of the vaccine

Very large clinical trials have shown that Moderna is effective in preventing COVID-19 in people
aged ≥12 years and older. Adults who had two doses of Moderna were about 94 percent less
likely to become ill from COVID-19 than people who did not get the vaccine. The vaccine was
also effective in people aged over 65 years (86%) and in adolescents aged 12-17 years.

Protection against COVID-19 starts from about two weeks after the first dose. While one dose
may give some protection, it may only last for the short-term. Two doses will give optimal
protection. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, so it is possible that you can still get infected
and sick from COVID-19 after vaccination. We do not know how long the protection from
Moderna will last. We will learn more about this over time. We currently do not know exactly
how effective COVID-19 vaccines are at preventing spread of the virus. This means that even
vaccinated people could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and even if they have
no symptoms or only mild symptoms, they could still pass it on to others.


-----

This is why it is important to continue other preventative measures like:

        - physical distancing

        - hand washing

        - wearing a face mask

        - COVID-19 testing and quarantine/isolation as required by your state/territory.

If you have been vaccinated with two doses of Moderna, you should still get a COVID-19 test if
you have symptoms that meet testing criteria according to your local health authority (e.g. fever,
cough, sore throat).

#### Who can receive this vaccine

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted provisional approval for use of
Spikevax (Moderna) in people aged ≥ 12 years.

#### Who should not receive this vaccine

You should not receive this vaccine if you have had:

      - anaphylaxis (a type of severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-
19 vaccine (i.e. Moderna or Comirnaty (Pfizer))

      - anaphylaxis after exposure to any component of the vaccine, including polyethylene
glycol (PEG)

      - myocarditis and/or pericarditis attributed to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19
vaccine (i.e. Moderna or Pfizer)

      - any other serious adverse event, that following review by an experienced immunisation
provider or medical specialist was attributed to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19
vaccine (i.e. Moderna or Pfizer) and without another cause identified.

#### Precautions for vaccination

People with certain conditions may need additional precautions such as staying for 30 minutes
of observation after having their vaccine or consulting an allergy specialist. Tell your
immunisation provider if you have had:

      - an allergic reaction to a previous dose or to an ingredient of an mRNA COVID-19
vaccine (i.e. Moderna or Pfizer)

      - **anaphylaxis to other vaccines or to other medicines.** Your provider can check to
ensure there are no common ingredients with the COVID-19 vaccine you are receiving

      - confirmed mastocytosis with recurrent anaphylaxis that requires treatment

If you **have a bleeding disorder or you are taking a blood-thinning medication**
(anticoagulant), tell your immunisation provider. Your immunisation provider can help determine
whether it is safe for you to have an intramuscular injection, and help decide the best timing for
injection.

#### Special circumstances to discuss before vaccination 

##### People with precautionary conditions for Moderna

People with a history of any of the following conditions can receive Moderna but advice should
be sought from a GP, immunisation specialist or cardiologist about the best timing of
vaccination and whether any additional precautions are recommended:

        - Recent (i.e. within the past 6 months) or current inflammatory cardiac illness e.g.,
myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis


-----

        - Acute rheumatic fever (i.e., with active myocardial inflammation) or acute rheumatic
heart disease

        - Acute decompensated heart failure

##### People with weakened immune systems (immunocompromise)

People with immunocompromise includes those who have a medical condition that weakens
their immune system. It also includes those who may be taking medications that suppress their
immune system.

The Australian Government strongly recommends people with immunocompromise receive
COVID-19 vaccination. Moderna is not a live vaccine. It is safe in people with
immunocompromise.

People with immunocompromise, including those living with HIV, have a higher risk of severe
illness from COVID-19, including a higher risk of death.

Clinical trials for Moderna did not include people with immunocompromise, except for a small
group of people with stable HIV. We do not know if Moderna is as effective in people with
immunocompromise compared to the rest of the population. It is possible that Moderna might
not be as effective in people with immunocompromise as it is in the general population. It is
important to continue other preventative measures such as physical distancing after
vaccination.

##### Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

Pregnant women and adolescents should be routinely offered one of the mRNA-based COVID-
19 vaccines, Pfizer or Moderna, at any stage of pregnancy. If you are trying to become
pregnant you do not need to delay vaccination or avoid becoming pregnant after vaccination.

Pregnant women with COVID-19 have an increased risk of severe illness and adverse
pregnancy outcomes. Real-world evidence has shown that Moderna is safe for pregnant
women and breastfeeding women. You can discuss the decision in relation to timing of
vaccination with your health professional.

If you are breastfeeding, you can have Moderna. You do not need to stop breastfeeding after
vaccination.

##### People with a history of COVID-19

If you have had COVID-19 in the past, tell your immunisation provider. Your provider may
advise you to wait for up to six months after recovery before having a COVID-19 vaccine. If you
have ongoing illness from COVID-19, discuss the best timing of vaccination with your treating
doctor.

##### Moderna and children

Moderna has been provisionally approved for use in people aged ≥ 12 years or older, and
cannot be given to younger people.

#### Ensuring the safety of Moderna

Moderna and other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed quickly due to increased funding
for vaccine research, and access to very large numbers of volunteers for research studies.
A large clinical trial involving around 30,000 people confirmed Moderna to be safe and effective.

The TGA assesses all vaccines in Australia. This ensures that, in order for a vaccine to be
approved, it is safe, effective and manufactured to a very high quality standard. A description of
[the process for approval of COVID-19 vaccines is available on the TGA website.](https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-approval-process)


-----

The safety of COVID-19 vaccines will be monitored continuously throughout the COVID-19
vaccination program.

There are reports of a very rare side effect involving blood clotting with low blood platelet count
after receiving the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine is made in a
different way from Moderna. There is no evidence of this condition being linked to the Moderna
COVID-19 vaccine.

You can report suspected side effects to your vaccination provider or other healthcare
professional. They will then make a formal report on your behalf to your state or territory health
department or directly to the TGA.

[If you would prefer to report it yourself, please visit the TGA website for information on how to](https://www.tga.gov.au/reporting-suspected-side-effects-associated-covid-19-vaccine)
report suspected side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

# Information on COVID-19 Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine 

Last updated: 15 September 2021

#### About the vaccine

**Pfizer is a vaccine that can prevent people from becoming ill from COVID-19. Two doses are**
required, usually given 3-6 weeks apart. In special circumstances the interval may be longer.
The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any live virus, and it cannot give you COVID-19.
It contains the genetic code for an important part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called the spike

COVID-19. The body breaks down the genetic code quickly.

Vaccination is voluntary and free. You can discuss any concerns or questions you have about
COVID-19 vaccination with your immunisation provider or your GP before you receive the
vaccine.

#### Benefits of the vaccine

A very large clinical trial showed that Pfizer is effective in preventing COVID-19 in people aged
12 years and older. People who had two doses of Pfizer were about 95 per cent less likely to
get symptomatic COVID-19 than people who did not get the vaccine. It was equally effective in
people over the age of 65 years, as well as people with some stable pre-existing medical
conditions.

Protection against COVID-19 starts from about 2–3 weeks after the first dose. While one dose
may give some protection, it may only last for the short-term. Two doses will give optimal
protection. No vaccine is 100 per cent effective, so it is possible that you can still get sick from
COVID-19 after vaccination.

SARS-CoV-2 could potentially still infect a vaccinated person. Even if they have no symptoms
or only mild symptoms, they could still pass it on to others. However, the COVID-19 vaccines
currently used in Australia is effective in reducing the likelihood of a vaccinated person
transmitting the virus to close contacts if the person is infected.

This is why after vaccination it is important to continue other preventative measures like:

        - physical distancing

        - hand washing

        - wearing a face mask

        - COVID-19 testing and quarantine/isolation as required by your state/territory.

and breastfeeding women.

If you are breastfeeding, you can have Pfizer. You do not need to stop breastfeeding after
vaccination.

##### People with a history of COVID-19

If you have had COVID-19 in the past, tell your immunisation provider. COVID-19 vaccination
can be deferred for up to six months after the acute illness in those who have had confirmed
SARSCoV-2 infection, as evidence suggests that past infection reduces the risk of reinfection
for at least 6 months. However, vaccination can start when they have recovered from the
symptomatic infection. It is reasonable to be vaccinated earlier than 6 months following
infection for some people. Discuss with your doctor or immunisation provider. If you have
ongoing illness from COVID-19, discuss the best timing of vaccination with your treating doctor.

##### Pfizer and children

Pfizer has been provisionally approved for use in people aged 12 years or older, and cannot be
given to younger people.
