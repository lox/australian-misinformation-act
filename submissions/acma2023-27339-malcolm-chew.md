Dear Reviewing Commi/ee Members:

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the exposure dra? of the
Communica@ons Legisla@on Amendment (CombaEng Misinforma@on and Disinforma@on)
Bill 2023.

I am in support of the purpose of such a Bill to manage and combat misinforma@on and
disinforma@on. This proposed Bill to combat the threat of online misinforma@on and
disinforma@on is a step in the right direc@on.

However, the dra? Bill (herea?er referred to as “Bill”) requires further consulta@on and
review. In its current dra?, it is a significant overreach by the Government and the Bill
should not be passed. In its current form:

1. The Bill places too much regulatory powers in the hand of the ACMA to hold digital

plaUorms to account.

a. One of the recommenda@on in the ACMA misinforma@on report in late 2020

and early 2021 was “The ACMA recommended that government should
provide it with reserve powers to register industry codes, enforce industry
code compliance and make standards rela@ng to the ac@vi@es of digital
plaUorms.”

b. The Bill will give ACMA power to compel digital plaUorms to provide

informa@on and evidence about misinforma@on and disinforma@on. This is a
breach of freedom of speech and privacy.

c. The Bill endeavours to balance between free speech online and the role of

digital plaUorms. However, the Bill does reserve the ability for the ACMA to
force digital plaUorms into compliance where current self-regulatory
voluntary codes (DIGI disinforma@on code of prac@ce) fail.

2. The Bill violates Australia’s commitment to human rights.

a. Ar@cle 19 of the Universal Declara@on of Human Rights (UDHR) states that

everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive
and impact informa@on and ideas through any media and regardless of
fron@ers.

b. The UDHR was ra@fied by Australia.
c. During Australia’s term as a member of the UN HRC (2018 – 2020 term),

Australia built it engagement around ten pillars and priori@es which included
good governance, freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.

d. The Bill violates the rights of good governance and individual’s freedom of

expression by controlling what is expressed on digital plaUorms. The Bill does
not take into account that Public educa@on and awareness coupled with good
governance protects the rights and freedom of the Australian people.

3. The Bill fails to protect the rights and freedom of the Australian people to freedom of

expression.

a. The fact sheet key points that is made available to the General Public

(h/ps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/communic
a@ons-legisla@on-amendment-combaEng-misinforma@on-anddisinforma@on-bill-2023-factsheet-june2023.pdf) has not provided clarity on
what is misinforma@on and disinforma@on.

b. The intent of the Bill is to address the need to address online harm. However,

the Bill includes a number of excep@ons including:

i. Content produced in good faith for entertainment, parody or sa@re;

ii. Professional news content and authorised electoral content;

iii. Content authorised by the Commonwealth, State or Territory

governments;

iv. Content produced by or for accredited educa@onal providers.

c. The excep@ons provides provision for organisa@ons and interest-groups

including the Government to control and manage the percep@on of the
General Public on issues through censorship.

4. The Bill does addresses intent of harm as a result of misinforma@on and

disinforma@on. The Bill is silent on the extent of harm.

a. For informa@on on digital plaUorms to be classified as misinforma@on or

disinforma@on, it must be reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious
harm with severe and wide reaching impact on the Australian people.

b. The role of the Australian Government eSafety Commissioner

(h/ps://www.esafety.gov.au/key-issues/how-to/remove-images-posts-othercontent) provides the avenue to report abusive content and request that
verified abusive content be removed from digital plaUorms.

c. The removal of such content is currently managed by digital plaUorms under

the “DIGI disinforma@on code of prac@ce” (h/ps://digi.org.au/disinforma@oncode/). Today, there are 8 major digital plaUorms which are signatories to
this code. They are Adobe, Apple, Google, Meta, Microso?, Redbubble,
TikTok and Twi/er.

d. Under the DIGI disinforma@on code of prac@ce, these signatories agree to

submit annual progress reports to the ACMA on their commitment to
safeguard against harm arising from the spread of misinforma@on and
disinforma@on on their plaUorms.

5. The Bill lacks a holis@c approach to the management of misinforma@on and

disinforma@on on digital plaUorms. The Australian Human Rights Commission
submission to the Senate Select Commi/ee on Foreign Interference through Social
Media has such a holis@c approach.

a. A submission by the Australian Human Rights Commission dated 16 February

2023 “Inquiry into the risk posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign
interference through social media” was made to the Senate Select Commi/ee
on Foreign Interference through Social Media.

b. In the submission, a wider range of recommenda@ons were made.

Highligh@ng some of the recommenda@ons are:


-----

i. The Australian Government establishing a permanent “whole-of
government” taskforce dedicated to preven@ng and comba@ng cybermanipula@on in Australia.

ii. Addressing and proposing recommenda@on to the risks to privacy

through digital literacy and transparent frameworks that apply to all
social media and internet companies.

iii. Transparency of censorship where social media plaUorms must

publicly disclose the content they have censor and making it an
offence to censor content whether that has not publicly disclosed to
the users.

The Bill in its current dra? requires further consulta@on and review before it is ready to be
considered for legisla@on. The greatest danger to this Bill is that it provides sufficient
safeguards. The Bill is a provision for organisa@ons and interest-groups including the
Government to control and manage the percep@on of the General Public on issues through
censorship.

Regards,
Malcolm
