Please consider this submission as an objection to the Australian Government’s proposed law(s) to “combat online
misinformation and disinformation” as this government, or any government does not have the right to control speech
and this proposal is considered a significant overreach in relation to the role of government.

This proposal is deemed dangerous, Orwellian in nature and is another example of the nanny-state mentality of
elected and unelected government official.
