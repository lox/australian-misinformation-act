The purpose of this submission is to purely curb more harm to the people of Australia through criminal and unlawful governments encroachment into the lives of Australians.

It is not to, in any way, to be taken as the legitimisation of the corrupted and treasonous systems of
government that Australians have endured for decades.

Governments DO NOT have any mandate for harming the people. In a democracy they are elected
to represent the people in the interest of the people NOT in the interest of foreign unelected bodies
that self-appoint to undermine and control the sovereignty of nations globally for no other reason
than their own interests.

Hiding the truth and calling the truth disinformation and misinformation is tantamount to an adult
telling a child “This is our secret” while they continually sexually violate the child. Governments
do NOT rule over the people, they are the employees of the people. The people rule over governments.

All information is legitimate and needs to be said. It is up to each and every being of We the People
to decide for themselves what constitutes the truth for them and in their interests. Collectively, the
interests of the people lies in their freedom to debate whatever information and issue they would
like to debate. What is NOT in the interests of, We the People, collectively is for governments to
dictate to us that immoral, unethical and downright criminal conduct such as public grooming and
indoctrination of children is disinformation and misinformation - as has been happening in Australia of late.

We the People do NOT want to entrust our own freedoms with which we are free to act to any illegitimate and unlawful governments.

The harm that is spoken of in your, so called, Fact Sheet is what happened when Australians trusted, what they thought were their governments, with their wellbeing and lives. The result was the
death rate in Australia went from a historic all time high of 4% to 16%. They were the lucky ones,
the ulucky are the many more injured and disable for life.

The Constititution of the Commonwealth of Australia 1901 Preamble said:

“COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT - PREAMBLE

WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and
Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
and under the Constitution hereby established:

And whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the Commonwealth of
other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen:


-----

Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:--“

Therefore, every part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 1901 was written for governments to be ”... of the people, by the people, for the people....” (Abraham Lincoln, 1863).

Contrary to the intent of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution of 1901 the, so called, governments we have had in Australia since 1973 have NOT been representative. In fact, no MP in parliament today has sworn a lawful oath to serve the people of Australia. Therefore, if they did not
take an oath to serve the people, then, all their Acts, Legislation, Rules or, so called, Laws being legislated DO NOT represent the people NOR are they interest of the people. In turn, this means that
NO AGENCY that has become part of the unrepresentative governments can make a legitimate nor
justifiable claim to be legislating for the people or their interests.

This is how it was done:

and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KNwGuPT7E&t=141s

Therefore, ACMA is an UNLAWFUL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL body. It has no authority, jurisdiction, nor mandate to determine what is truth or is not. Regardless, NO GOVERNMENT has the
right to strip the people of their rights to freedoms. One of the most fundamental is the freedom to
free speech.

Watch how silencing Social Media Truth Tellers by criminals in governments of the world including Australian governments was used to cause harm to the people:

https://www.bitchute.com/video/Gy4nlHGrpL0F/

This is precisely why and how illegitimate criminals calling themselves governments in Australian
(and globally) were able to use the MISINFORMATION and DISINFORMATION PROPAGANDA to suppress the truth and by labelling truth tellers all sorts of imbued derrogatory labels to
deter them from telling the truth. In fact, they used the MISINFORMATION and DISINFORMATION LABEL to prevent them from speaking the truth by making CRIMINAL agreements with
criminally convicted corporations and with Social Media corporations to personally profit from the
death of millions of Australians with the MISINFORMATION and DISINFORMATION LABEL
as their instrument of achieving their criminal goals of laundering public money to funnel it into
their own pockets and the pockets of the proprietors and shareholders of corporations selling
products from whom those very same criminal governments were receiving direct donations. All
these actions and the very act of labelling the truth as MISINFORMATION and DISINFORMA

-----

TION are in themselves criminal offences. Thus, any legislation, particularly, ungazetted and unascented legislation which is against the interest of the people and which suppresses the freedoms of
the people is not mandated nor representative.

It is such abuse during the criminally planned and executed, so called, COVID pandemic that these
criminals were able to impose unlawful incarceration and forceful injections on the free people of
Australia of harmful substances. Neither denying, hiding, obfuscating, dismissing the REAL
FACTS, nor preventing the prosections of perpetrators of such crimes will ever justify nor make
such criminal actions truthful or factual.

Silencing the People is NOT Democracy, it is Communism. Those in parliament who seek to take
the basic unalienable freedoms of Australians away from them cannot be doing it in the public interest. Criminals never silence their victims in the victims’ interests. In fact, that silencing is also
unlawful. Those few who are selected to be in government through the support of international bodies that have been funded by philanthropists whose only interest is the accumulation of more billions (GREED) is never in the interest of the people, cannot dictate to the entirety of the Australian
People what they can and cannot say. In fact, that is one of the principles of the UNHCR 1951 Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of a Refugee states that prosecution for expressing a
political opinion constitutes a reason (amongst others) for defining a refugee seeking assylum.

# Our Constitution, a LIVING DOCUMENT and the Key to Regaining our Sovereignty!

In 1959 our Constitution was subverted, substituted in an act of Treason. Political parties funded by a global
criminal cartel and led by their controlled entity the United Nations, falsely declared authority over the
Governor General and Commander-in-Chief thereby removing all Crown authority from all Commonwealth
Acts.

They proceeded to create by deceit, a parallel nation, an illusion upon which they then built their own fake
Commonwealth of Australia. They replaced Common Law with corporate Maritime Law then used this
framework to control all monies, taxes, police, military and judiciary, stealing people’s rights and enforcing
their will using their own corporate police and judicial systems.

In 1965, just six years later, all States and Governors joined their illusionary Commonwealth and created a
counterfeit currency, the Australian Dollar, issued and managed by yet another illusion, the Rothschild’s
owned Reserve Bank of Australia.

In 1972 the public faces of the Cartel in another act of deception, gained huge popularity by announcing an
end to the Vietnam War, the same war they created in 1962, which saw the Labor Party winning the

[s]election by a landslide.

Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard sworn in by a falsely appointed Governor General, Paul Hasluck formed a
Duumvirate, a ‘government’ of just two people. Now controlling 27 Portfolios, they produced a counterfeit
Constitution removing any reference to the Crown and Queen, registered the copyright of their document
under their new Corporate, legal construct and quietly adopted it as a replacement for our formal
Constitution.

The Australian people were none the wiser, were never informed and nor was the required referendum ever
conducted to gain the lawful consent of the Australian people. These acts of treason, lies and subterfuge
were hidden and even promoted by a complicit, corrupt and lying media.

These criminal corporate entities and everyone involved at every level have willingly continued this illusion
of government ever since. They have collected unlawful taxes, enforced control of unlawful Acts and slowly
over time impoverished a once prosperous, happy and growing nation. Their treachery has seen them over
time slowly pass ownership and control of our country to the United Nations, more recently through the
Cartel owned World Economic Forum.

What they chose to ignore and hoped we’d never find out, is that our lawful Constitution remains current
and Common Law remains our rightful basis of Justice. Everything we’ve been conditioned to accept and the
rules we’ve lived by are an ILLUSION, fake, a cruel joke.

It’s now time to reclaim our country, our freedoms and our rightful system of Common Law Justice by loudly
proclaiming the existence of our Constitution as a Living Document and declaring it the rule of law!

It’s up to each one of us to ENFORCE IT! Read it…Embrace it…Apply it to every aspect of your life…Quote it to
ANYONE or ANY corporate entity posing as government or its agent. They have NO authority and NO
Jurisdiction. Constantly challenge ANYONE who attempts to speak or act outside of it.

**Our Constitution IS THE LAW! Everything else is FRAUD.**
