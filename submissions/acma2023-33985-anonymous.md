Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
## Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this submission to express my outrage and deep concern regarding the
proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is evident that this bill reflects a disregard for the freedom of
speech of Australian citizens, threatening the democratic principles upon which our nation is
built.

The proposed bill creates a clear distinction between two classes of citizens       - namely,
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions who are granted the
## authority to disseminate information that may be deemed true or false, and regular citizens,
who are denied the same privilege, despite often possessing a greater depth of knowledge
on various subjects, including insights gained from industry experience. This disparity places
the voices of regular citizens at risk and undermines the power of the internet as an emblem
## of democracy.

Moreover, the excessive fines imposed by the bill will result in digital services being more
restrictive in enabling free speech than any existing regulations allow. The all-encompassing
nature of the code further exacerbates the potential harm, as it offers no safeguards or
mechanisms to mitigate the restrictions imposed on online discourse.

## Attempting to accurately discern between truth and falsehood is an arduous task. New information frequently emerges that contradicts previously accepted facts. The list of
examples provided clearly illustrates how certain authoritative statements were later proven
## to be incorrect. Under this legislation, such well-intentioned information could easily be
classified as misinformation causing public health harm, leading to its removal. It is worth
noting that the bill's scope also includes information that may be deemed misleading or
deceptive, further curbing our freedom of speech and hindering meaningful dialogue.

Governments and proponents of bills such as this often purport to champion truth rather
than censorship. However, it is disconcerting when even experts, such as former Deputy
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Nick Coatsworth, express serious reservations about the bill's broad
## application. His scathing critique, shared via his personal Twitter account, raises questions


-----

## about the credibility and effectiveness of this legislation.

 Additionally, the proposed bill's delegation of legislative power to private entities, such as
the registration of Misinformation Codes, violates the principle of responsible delegation to
entities directly accountable to Parliament. This arrangement amounts to an unconstitutional
## abdication of Parliament's legislative power.

Furthermore, provisions within the bill that determine what constitutes misinformation and
serious harm impinge upon the implied constitutional freedom of political communication.
Matters related to public policy, such as harm to health, the environment, and the economy,
are subjects of vigorous political debate, scientific investigation, and differing perspectives.
Limiting legitimate discussion on these matters would unjustly curtail our freedom of
political communication.

The bill assumes that the government and its accredited media and educational institutions
possess the sole authority to decide what is true, disregarding the experiences and
## viewpoints of ordinary Australians. Without diversity in viewpoints, the process of senseÂ­
making becomes undermined, inhibiting the exploration of all possibilities. The bill effectively
silences certain views before they can be shared, eroding the essence of a democratic
society.

Moreover, the legislation intimidates both digital platform providers and ordinary users,
levying threats of reputational damage, financial penalties, and burdensome requirements. In
the case of the latter, the prospect of being compelled to appear before the ACMA can cause
undue stress and disruption in their lives. The potential expectation for individuals to report
on others, reminiscent of Soviet-era tactics, is entirely antithetical to Australian values and
the spirit of mateship.

Ultimately, this bill risks plunging voters into darkness by categorizing certain political party
## viewpoints as misinformation and censoring them from digital platforms. Access to crucial information pertaining to voting decisions is paramount in a democratic society, and this bill

has the potential to thwart that access.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider the implications of the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)

Bill 2023. It is essential to uphold the democratic ideals of freedom of speech, diverse
viewpoints, and citizen engagement in the public discourse. I implore you to withdraw this
bill and seek alternative measures that respect the rights and voices of all Australians.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take into account the concerns
raised, as well as the potential ramifications of this bill on our democratic society.

Yours sincerely,
