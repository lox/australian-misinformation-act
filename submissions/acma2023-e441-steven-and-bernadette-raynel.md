process of debate is fundamental to our governmental system. Debate in the public square is at times robust, but always
generating an environment where thought is challenged and expanded by differing concepts.
To even be in the position where we need to defend this most fundamental human right, to be able to freely express an opinion or
information that may differ from another's ideologies and/or information is an indication of how far we as a nation are veering off
course.
The very basis of science, on which we are told to rely today, is the consideration of robust exchange of information and ideas
without the limitations of legislation. No advancement can be made if thought and expression is controlled and limited to
Authoritarian decrees, How can science evolve and develop as yet unknown concepts if the information is buried by fear of being
labeled as "misinformation" before it can be properly explored.
The public are well able to sift truth from error. Even if that "truth" may be government imposed.
This bill being considered at the moment is nothing short of a totalitarian power grab. No matter how it may be gift wrapped, it
must be defeated and buried where it may never surface again.
I stand with most of the aware and intelligent public with a resounding NO vote.
