Submission on the exposure draft of the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 20 August 2023

I am making this submission in my role as a journalist and writer^^^^^^^^^^^^^|This
proposed legislation sets up the Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) as a
powerful censorship organ of the state. The effect will be that ACMA controls everything that
Australians can see, hear and say online through industry codes of practice enforced by Big Tech
corporations. This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine what is
"untrue, misleading or deceitful" (misinformation) when they have no such ability. ACMA doesn't
know (and cannot know) what is true. It therefore cannot preside over, set and enforce
misinformation codes of practice. This is outsourced state censorship, totalitarian in scope, designed
to control the public conversation and camouflaged as protection. Misinformation is jargon for being
wrong, and disinformation is a made-up word for lying. The government should not be in the
business of determining "truth" for the Australian public. This legislation should therefore be
rejected in full.
