I am totally opposed to the passing of this bill or any similar legislation.

If enacted this bill would infringe on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. It is
dangerous to enable the government to define anything as either true or false and to enforce
penalties for straying outside the boundaries thereof, while it may not be immediately dangerous, it
has the potential to bring about a regime of total control over what is acceptable to say and argue in
public forums. There is also the potential for something considered "misinformation" or
"disinformation" at one point in time to then later be proved true, or alternatively something that
could be at one point considered true could later be determined to be false and then fall under
either "misinformation" or "disinformation". Facts have a tendency to change when new information
comes to light, policing information is not only morally wrong but also may be done incorrectly with
no malice involved.
