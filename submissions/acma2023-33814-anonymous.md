Submission regarding the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment 2023.

I do not support this legislation in its current form. This Bill is against free speech, which is a basic
human right, and is an example of governmental over-reach. It gives too much power to the ACMA.

It makes no distinction between misinformation and disinformation, which is unfair as
misinformation is often not malicious in nature and is in fact believed by the people spreading it. In
addition the penalties are too extreme and I believe many innocent people will be harmed by this
proposed legislation.
