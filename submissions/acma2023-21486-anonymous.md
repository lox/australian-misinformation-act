I believe that the right to free speech has precedence over every other factor in a truly free
and open democracy.
In a democracy everybody has the right to express their views and argue their opinion in the
modern public square of social media.
Even if I do not believe the arguments, opinions or viewpoints of a person I believe in their
right to express them. In the famous quote “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend
to the death your right to say it.” Without this freedom of speech we cannot have a
democracy.
What one person or group considers misinformation or even disinformation is too
subjective to provoke such clandestine censorship and self-censorship as will inevitably be
imposed by this bill.
Criminal Law as it has evolved since the Magna Carta is the only “protection from harm”
that a citizen in a democracy requires. Everything else is censorship and a curtailment of
human rights.
**I do not want this bill to pass in this or any other form. I do not consent to this covert**
censorship under threat of financial penalty.
