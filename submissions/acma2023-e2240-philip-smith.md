MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL

I find it incomprehensible that in a country such as Australia where so many have sacrificed their
youth, liberty and lives to fight tyranny and oppression, that a modern government could even
entertain introducing such a draconian, regressive bill. Little wonder that Orwellian parallels are
drawn at the very suggestion.

It seems that common sense has now indeed become the “heresy of heresies” as George Orwell
forewarned.

For example, if modern people struggle to define what a woman is, how would ACMA view a
statement such as, “There are only two genders!”? Would this scientific and irrefutable fact be
considered misinformation or disinformation?

It is a totally preposterous proposal to censor or supress people’s thoughts and ideas and their
common law right to express them.

The truth is independent of human desires and fashions.

“The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race;
posterity as well as the existing generation”.

John Stuart Mill

On Liberty 1859

“Governments only exist by the consent of the people in order to protect the basic rights of, and
promote the common good of society.”

John Locke

1632 – 1704

If people are denied their basic human right to express their ideas fully and freely their only
alternative will be action.

“Tyranny and anarchy are never far apart”.

Jeremy Bentham

1748 – 1832
