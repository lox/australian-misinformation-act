## 1. Executive Summary

Croakey Health Media strongly supports efforts to more effectively regulate digital platforms in
order to stop the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. It should be acknowledged
that in Australia, digital platforms are operating upon the Country of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander people, and therefore have a particular responsibility to ensure their cultural safety and
wellbeing.

In this submission, we make several recommendations aimed at ensuring such efforts integrate
the expertise of First Nations peoples and organisations, public health people and organisations
and wider civil society, and provide greater transparency and accountability to communities.
Cultural safety should be integrated into the design and implementation of these structures and
processes.

Croakey asserts the importance of acknowledging the community’s right to a safe online
environment in the legislation. The right to freedom of speech must be balanced against this
right, as well as respects for the wider rights of community members who use the internet. The
rights of children and others who are most likely to suffer harm from an unsafe online
environment must be prioritised.

We also stress the importance of transparency, accountability and deliberative community
engagement as part of this legislation. These matters are too important for the health and
wellbeing of communities and democracy to be left to governments and agencies working
directly with powerful corporations and their representatives in ways that are not always
transparent or accessible to the wider community.

In the interests of transparency, we urge that the Government and all MPs disclose the lobbying
efforts that have been undertaken by the digital platforms and other relevant parties, such as
corporate media, in relation to this legislation. This should include details of all donations to
political parties and individual MPs, related meetings, gifts and any other lobbying activities.

Croakey also notes that “freedom of expression” is often used as a justification to enable the
dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, including racism and hate speech directed
at particular communities. It is critical that the voices and concerns of these communities be
privileged in designing, implementing and evaluating this legislation and associated activities. We
also note that there are many other policy areas meriting attention in order to support greater
freedom of speech within Australia, including reform to support a more diverse media and news
and information ecosystem, with targeted support for public interest journalism. Concerted
efforts are needed to end the market dominance of powerful corporations such as Google, Meta
and News Corp, and to ensure that all communities – geographic and interest-based – have
access to safe, reliable and relevant news and information.

We believe that legislative approaches like this are only one part of the overall response that is
needed. We urge the development of a whole-of-government and whole-of-community strategy
for envisioning a safe, reliable and relevant news and information system, acknowledging that
online platforms are enmeshed with other elements of the news and information system. This is
particularly important in an era of escalating climate-related disasters, where emergency and
reliable communications will become ever more important.

## 2. Introduction: about Croakey Health Media

Croakey Health Media (Croakey) is widely recognised as an innovator and leader in the emerging
[not-for-profit public interest journalism sector in Australia (Public Interest Journalism Initiative,](https://piji.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hill-r-2021.-understanding-the-role-that-philanthropy-can-play-in-public-interest-journalism.pdf)

[environmental determinants of health, and bring a health-in-all-policies approach to our work.](https://www.croakey.org/category/determinants-of-health/environmental-determinants-of-health/)
We privilege the voices and expertise of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through our
[work, including through our governance. Our board is chaired by a leading Aboriginal health](https://www.croakey.org/about-croakey-health-media/)
academic at UTS, Professor Megan Williams, who is Wiradjuri through paternal family. Croakey
Health Media is a member of the Local and Independent News Association (LINA). Our members
belong to various professional organisations, including the Media, Entertainment and Arts
Alliance.

Croakey undertakes many activities relevant to this consultation, through our journalism,
community engagement and policy submissions.

We have published an extensive archive of articles on the market power of digital platforms as
powerful commercial determinants of health, examining the many way that this undermines
[public health. See these articles here.](https://www.croakey.org/category/determinants-of-health/commercial-determinants-of-health/digital-platforms/)

Croakey has also published extensively on the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation
as threats to the health of individuals, communities, Country, democracies and planetary health.
[See these articles here.](https://www.croakey.org/category/media-and-health/misinformation-and-disinformation/)

We also publish on the importance of a diverse, sustainable and robust public interest journalism
sector as a fundamental determinant of health, including for addressing concerns such as
misinformation and disinformation and the commercial determinants of health, such as the
[digital platforms. See these articles here.](https://www.croakey.org/category/media-and-health/public-interest-journalism/)

We have contributed to several previous inquiries on matters related to this consultation,
including:

  - [Response to ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry (19 February, 2019)](https://www.croakey.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Croakey-Health-Media-February-2019.pdf)

  - Submission to Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI) consultation on Disinformation Industry
[Code (24 November, 2020).](https://www.croakey.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DIGI_CroakeyHealthMedia_submission_24Nov.pdf)

This submission urged the Federal Government to appoint an independent committee of
appropriately qualified public health experts to report on the public health impacts of
disinformation and misinformation and to make evidence-based recommendations for
policy reform, drawing upon the public health literature. This committee should include
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers and organisations. It should include
specific consideration of policies and strategies for addressing the spread of racism, hate
speech and white supremacy as part of the tide of disinformation. The submission also
urged that the capacity of the public interest journalism sector to investigate
disinformation and misinformation should be strengthened through policy reform.

  - [Submission to the Select Committee on Social Media and Online Safety (17 January, 2022).](https://www.croakey.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CHM_sub_finalOnlineSafety.pdf)

This submission identified eight key themes from our relevant coverage:

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 5


-----

1. That the undermining of democracy and democratic institutions due to an unsafe online
environment is a global problem and is not limited solely to Australia.

2. The online environment is unsafe, especially during a global pandemic, because it is
disseminating and amplifying misinformation and disinformation, undermining public
health measures and pandemic control

3. The monopoly power of these corporations makes them unresponsive to the concerns
of businesses, governments and communities because of power imbalances. Australia
witnessed these companies’ preparedness to exercise their market power – reducing
communities’ access to information and services even in the midst of a global public
health crisis [as has now happened in Canada with Meta blocking access to news on
Facebook during a bushfire crisis].

4. Mental health is being harmed by the impact of the digital platforms in disseminating
and amplifying hate. speech, racism, White Supremacy, extremist far right views, and
bullying.

5. The online environment is particularly dangerous for children. As well as the
dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, there is the impact of marketing by
predatory companies – notably alcohol, gaming and junk food.

6. Many health and public interest organisations have raised concerns that Australian
Government regulatory responses to date have been inadequate and piecemeal, in
relation to a range of related public health concerns, including harmful marketing
practices, and misinformation and disinformation.

7. Regulation of digital platforms should be encompassing of all the public health and
public interest concerns involved (including media policy, monopoly-busting, public
health) – rather than focusing on single issues and self-regulatory approaches.

8. Global issues demand multilateral solutions _he power and reach of the Big Tech
companies requires multilateral regulatory reform.

  - Submission to Review by the industry group DIGI of The Australian Code of Practice on
[Disinformation and Misinformation (18 July, 2022). In this submission, we argued that](https://www.croakey.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CHM_Submission_DIGI__18July2022.pdf)
misinformation and disinformation are such profound, pervasive and growing public
health concerns that governments must take far more wide-ranging action than simply
leaving the matter to a voluntary, industry, self-regulatory code. Health departments and
other areas of governments, public health experts, First Nations health and community
representatives, the community sector, and community leaders must also be involved in
whole-of-government and whole-of-community responses

[These and other Croakey submissions that may be of use for this consultation can be seen here.](https://www.croakey.org/about-croakey-health-media/croakey-submissions/)

We also publish in the academic literature and engage with wider public spheres on these topics.
Croakey’s Chair Professor Megan Williams and Editor-In-Chief Dr Melissa Sweet have contributed

We have hosted a number of relevant online webinars. For example, in June 2021, Croakey
hosted an online #CroakeyLIVE webinar to engage the public health and wider community in
identifying solutions and ways forward to a safer, healthier digital environment.

## 3. Croakey’s engagement with this consultation

### 3.1. Department consultation

On 7 July 2023, Editor-in-Chief Dr Melissa Sweet attended a consultation hosted by the
Department, held online and in person. Participants appeared to be mainly media industry
representatives and some journalism academics and organisations.

Following the consultation, Dr Melissa Sweet emailed the following comments to Sam Kursar:

_“My comments are made from a public health perspective rather than from the specific interests_
_of Croakey Health Media. They are also general, and extend beyond the specific questions and_
_issues informing the consultation._

_Firstly, it seems there are two over-arching, related public health issues at stake:_

_1. The toxic, unstable and inequitable news and information ecosystem. This issue is only going_
_to become more important as climate disruption escalates. The COVID pandemic has given a_
_taster of how the news and information ecosystem – globally, nationally and locally –_
_undermines evidence-based, equitable policy and informed community responses._

_2. The harmful market power and impact of digital platforms. This issue of course includes but_
_extends way beyond misinformation and disinformation to include, for example, marketing of_
_harmful products, breaches of privacy, undermining of healthy public policy, and stifling of_
_innovation._

_The impact of misinformation and disinformation is evident in both these areas, noting that while_
_digital platforms have amplified these problems, misinformation and disinformation are spread in_
_multiple other contexts._

_Comments during the consultation suggested that the Government is taking steps to tackle some_
_of these issues through legislation and other measures in multiple portfolios._

_However, it seems there are no coherent national strategies that present a whole-of-government_
_vision for:_

_• A reliable and thriving news and information ecosystem that centres the public interest._

_• Regulation of digital platforms in the public interest, encompassing all areas of concern_
_about their impact, including on the economy, public health and democracy, the news and_
_information ecosystem, health and wellbeing._

_Developing such strategies would provide important opportunities to increase engagement of_
_communities, especially those who are most at risk of being harmed in the current environment,_
_and also for engaging with public health expertise._

_Specific feedback_

_I note that very little attention is paid to public health in this legislation or accompanying_
_documents. It is not clear that the breadth of matters encompassed by ‘public health’ is_
_understood; it extends beyond health and healthcare matters._

_Yet the public health impacts of misinformation and disinformation are wide-ranging and_
_significant; they undermine our capacity to respond to global health threats such as climate_
_change and inequality, and to address public health concerns such as racism, poor health literacy_
_and inequitable policies. Public health expertise in the commercial determinants of health is also_
_highly relevant for to these matters._

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 8


-----

_The public health sector has considerable expertise in many of these issues, through work in_
_research, policy development, service delivery, advocacy and with communities. If the Department_
_is not planning to convene a public health panel as part of your consultation process, then I_
_strongly encourage this, and would be happy to suggest some useful contributors.”_

The Department accepted this offer from Croakey.

### 3.2. Online consultation hosted by Croakey

-----

  - Dr Becky White
Digital health researcher, Adjunct Research Fellow, Curtin University

Participants emphasised the benefits that Indigenous and public health lenses, methodologies
and expertise can bring to consideration of these matters, noting the importance of taking
comprehensive, holistic and multi-disciplinary approaches. It was stressed that Indigenous people
and organisations need to be involved in shared leadership and decision-making, both internally
within governments and digital platforms, as well as in consultations and accountability
mechanisms.

Suggestions and questions included:

  - A mechanism is needed for Indigenous people to be involved in regulatory ecosystem

  - Will there be specific mechanisms to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-led
industry e.g., targeted and safe engagement?

  - Measuring harm – will Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people be involved in
determining this?

  - Ensure the guidance documents for industry include requirement to engage First Peoples
and Indigenous data sovereignty and governance and Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual
Property.

  - Input of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to self-determine reporting
mechanisms and policies and procedures for receiving and handling reports

  - Noted there are no mentions of racism as such although hatred against a group is named.

  - There are no mentions of cultural safety – ensuring and evaluating cultural safety:
particular language that other parts of the Commonwealth Government are using,
including in legislation

  - What is a key KPI of health of effective measures? E.g., number of takedowns? Or,
rectification?

  - KPI on cultural safety – what would that be; is that possible?

  - Data availability – making it available so that e.g., academics can access and use it.

  - Ensure alignment with 'public protection' including cultural safety in Health Practitioner
Regulation National Law (National Law) and joint statement by Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Health Strategy Group and the National Health Leadership Forum
https://www.ahpra.gov.au/News/2022-10-13-landmark-public-protection-reform-billpasses-parliament.aspx

  - How we will know what difference the legislation is making; what will be the measures of
success?

  - How does it compare to approaches in other countries? Which countries are leading in
this space?

  - Will this undermine the business model that supports algorithms that spread polarising
content including misinformation and disinformation?

  - How is ’serious harm’ judged, and by who?

  - Are there plans for a whole-of-government strategy to tackle misinformation and
disinformation?

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 10


-----

  - Does the department have structures and processes in place to ensure public health
expertise is engaged early in policy development and implementation, reflecting HiAP
approaches as per the wellbeing framework and climate and health strategy?

  - Other comments: it’s disappointing the supporting materials don’t give specific examples
around climate disinformation and misinformation, or specifically address racism and hate
speech.

### 3.3. Open online discussion on related topics

On 14 August 2023, Croakey hosted an online #CroakeyLIVE discussion about the potential for
government intervention to interrupt the damaging corporate domination of vital digital
communications infrastructure, using the hashtag #DigitalNationBuilding.

Read a report about this event:

[Amid the Twitter bin fire, time for Australia to do some digital nation building? (17 August, 2023).](https://www.croakey.org/amid-the-twitter-bin-fire-time-for-australia-to-do-some-digital-nation-building/)

More than 20 people attended this event, which produced the following set of draft principles.

# A digital way forward

Below are principles advocating for safer digital infrastructure and news and information systems
arising from a #CroakeyLIVE webinar on #DigitalNationBuilding.

Initially, the principles were endorsed by some webinar participants, and on 20 August they were
[also published at Croakey.org inviting others to sign and also post comments.](https://www.croakey.org/suggested-principles-to-guide-safer-digital-communications-infrastructure-what-do-you-think/)

1. Digital platforms/communications infrastructure is vital for the health and wellbeing of

people, communities, Country and the planet. In an era of escalating crises and
emergencies, including climate disruption, it should be regarded as essential
infrastructure that must be accessible and available for all, noting its importance in
emergency communications in particular.

2. Digital platforms/communications infrastructure should be a safe space for diverse

communities, and for respectful interactions and communications, as well as the sharing
of reliable, relevant news and information. It should not incentivise or support the sharing
of misinformation and disinformation.

3. Digital platforms/communications infrastructure should centre the public interest, rather

than being driven by corporate imperatives that actively undermine health and wellbeing.

4. Governments have a role in supporting innovation, growth and greater diversity in this

sector, including through seeding of not-for-profit or other non-corporate models, and
more effective regulation of Big Tech.

5. The expertise and values of First Nations peoples should inform development of this

sector.

6. Equity considerations should underpin developments and discussions in this space.

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 11


-----

7. Young people are also central to these discussions. People and communities who have

particularly benefited from the platform formerly provided by Twitter, including people
with disabilities, lived experience of health challenges, poverty, housing insecurity, and
incarceration, also have much to contribute to this discussion.

8. The health sector, researchers, professional organisations and other forms of institutional

power have an important role in these discussions, and should be engaging with civil
society, as well as tech researchers, developers and advocates, and policymakers.

9. The health workforce, including researchers, clinicians, policymakers, public health and

health promotions professionals, educators, community members, carers and NGOs,
should be supported to develop greater skills and knowledge in this area.

10. Digital platforms/communications infrastructure should contribute to community

cohesion and the sharing and development of knowledge, networks and connections, at
local, national and global levels

### 3.4. Article by Croakey director, Professor Bronwyn Fredericks

[On 16 August 2023, Croakey published an article, ‘When tackling misinformation and](https://www.croakey.org/when-tackling-misinformation-and-disinformation-indigenous-peoples-perspectives-and-representation-are-vital/)
[disinformation, Indigenous peoples’ perspectives and representation are vital’, summarising key](https://www.croakey.org/when-tackling-misinformation-and-disinformation-indigenous-peoples-perspectives-and-representation-are-vital/)
themes of a submission to this inquiry by a senior Aboriginal academic, Professor Bronwyn
Fredericks, who is also a director of Croakey Health Media.

This submission was made in a personal capacity; however, Croakey notes its importance and
relevance for this submission. Below are key themes from the article, which recommended that
the online safety and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people must be addressed
much more explicitly as part of legislative efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation,

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 12


-----

with active enforcement of penalties for digital platforms that spread misinformation and
disinformation.

Acknowledgement of the harm caused to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and
communities by misinformation and disinformation, that the spread of misinformation and
disinformation for Indigenous peoples is an extension of the colonial project that seeks control
over how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are represented in national/public
discourses.

Representation matters: Greater consideration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
perspectives is needed. Given that Indigenous people are avid users of social media and that false
representations of Indigenous people continue to undermine social health and wellbeing
outcomes, it is essential that Indigenous perspectives are sought, and Indigenous representation
is included. It is warranted that the ACMA encourage codes and standards that specifically target
racist misinformation and disinformation directed at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples. ACMA must work in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community
groups who are best placed to speak to the impact of mis/disinformation and what strategies
need to be built into providers’ codes. ACMA should require media platforms to report on KPIs
specifically relating to combating misinformation pertaining to Indigenous peoples. This should
include reporting on the measures taken to assure cultural safety and inclusion of Indigenous
representatives/voices in responses. It would also be beneficial to build the protection of
Indigenous communities into ACMA’s requirements for platforms to register an industry code.

Cultural safety should be integrated into processes and structures for the investigation of
complaints to ensure that digital platforms comply with codes and standards. The cultural
competency of both ACMA and digital platforms/service providers is of the upmost importance.
Improving cultural competency and increasing the Indigenous workforce can assist in identifying
and responding to claims of misinformation/disinformation. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples are strongly considered when the ACMA obtains information, fact-checkers, or thirdparty contractors to assist them in monitoring compliance, and that the employment of
Indigenous staff are encouraged in codes/standards as a measure to combat misinformation.

Greater accountability needed. Although the ACMA will not have powers to force the removal of
content from third party platforms, any policy that would make publishers accountable for the
information they publish/distribute is welcomed, as are mechanisms that would see referrals to
the anti-discrimination commissions or other legislative bodies.

In cases where the removal of content is not plausible, publishers should be compelled in their
codes/standards to engage in fact checking, as was done on some social media platforms during
the pandemic, with mixed results. The wider social impact of any information publicly posted, as
well as the representations it implies about Indigenous peoples and cultures should be
considered in the codes – not just whether the written text is deemed “truthful”. Those creating
and sharing memes and other satirical content should be equally accountable for the information
they share. In many cases it is difficult/near impossible for members of the public to distinguish
satirical content from factual reporting or to determine how they will be read and understood.
Reconsideration that the code and standard-making powers exclude “electoral and referendum
content and other types of content such as professional news and satire”. Whilst upholding
parliamentary freedom, robust discussion and freedom of speech is important, political
discussion should be not used as an excuse to sway opinions through sensationalised and
misinformed representations. If the ACMA does not include misinformation in traditional news
media in its powers, then it should continue to work with other bodies to ensure accountability.

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 13

Enforce penalties. At face value, penalties for infringements appear sufficient but such measures
must be enforced rather than being treated as piecemeal “slaps on the wrist” that do not
demand change.

## 4. Croakey responses to this consultation

Our overarching feedback to this consultation is the importance of ensuring transparent,
accountable structures and processes that integrate the expertise of First Nations people and
organisations, public health experts and organisations, and wider civil society. Cultural safety
should be integrated into the design and implementation of these structures and processes.
These matters are too important for the health and wellbeing of communities and democracy to
be left to governments and agencies working directly with powerful corporations in ways that are
not always transparent or accessible to the wider community.

We note the irony of this consultation process being undermined by a concerted campaign of
misinformation and disinformation that has been disseminated by some mainstream media
outlets as well as online platforms.

We urge that a comprehensive public education campaign be undertaken in conjunction with the
legislation, with a particular focus on educating communities about their rights to a safe online
environment, and empowering communities to contribute to greater accountability of digital
platforms. Outcomes arising from this legislation should be communicated clearly and
transparently with communities.

In the interests of transparency, we urge that the Government and all MPs disclose the lobbying
efforts that have been undertaken by the digital platforms and other relevant parties, such as
corporate media, in relation to this legislation.

Below we respond to some of the issues identified for specific feedback during this consultation
(image below is from a Department presentation).

_We pay our respects to the Traditional Custodians of the Country where we live,_ 15


-----

### 4.1. Freedom of expression: do the powers strike an appropriate balance?

According to the Department: “The ACMA codes are designed to protect freedom of speech
while holding digital platforms to account”.

The Exposure Draft on p 53 states:

(3AC) The Parliament also intends that digital platform services be regulated, in order to prevent
and respond to misinformation and disinformation on the services, in a manner that:

(a) has regard to freedom of expression; and

(b) respects user privacy; and

(c) protects the community and safeguards end-users against harm caused, or contributed to, by
misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services; and

(d) enables public interest considerations in relation to misinformation and disinformation on
digital platform services to be addressed in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial and
administrative burdens on digital 2 platform providers; and

(e) will readily accommodate technological change; and

(f) encourages the provision of digital platform services to the Australian community; and

(g) encourages the development of technologies relating to digital platform services

Croakey asserts the importance of acknowledging the community’s right to a safe online
environment in the legislation. The right to freedom of speech must be balanced against this
right, as well as respects for the wider rights of community members who use the internet. It
should be acknowledged that in Australia, digital platforms are operating upon the Country of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and therefore have a particular responsibility to
ensure their cultural safety and wellbeing. The rights of children and others who are most likely
to suffer harm from an unsafe online environment must be prioritised.

Croakey also notes that “freedom of expression” is often used as an excuse to enable the
dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, including racism and hate speech directed
at particular communities. It is critical that the voices and concerns of these communities be
privileged in designing, implementing and evaluating this legislation and associated activities.

Croakey also notes that there are many other policy areas meriting attention in order to support
greater freedom of speech within Australia, including policy reform to support a more diverse
media and news and information ecosystem, with concerted efforts to end the market
dominance of powerful corporations such as Google, Meta and News Corp. This market
dominance is a greater threat to freedom of speech than efforts to regulate such companies.

### 4.2. Definitions 

We flag our concern about the definition of serious harm as “harm that affects a significant
portion of the Australian population, economy or environment, or undermines the integrity of an
Australian democratic process”. As already mentioned in this submission, Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander people experience a disproportionate impact from online misinformation and
disinformation, including racism. The terminology of “a significant proportion” is problematic
from the perspectives of other population groups too.

### 4.3. Scope of the powers

We support non-signatories to the voluntary codes being subject to this legislation.

### 4.4. Comments from other parties 

Professor Kathryn Backholer:

_“The Bill is an important safeguard for our digital information ecosystems. Misinformation and_
_disinformation can be dangerous – we saw this during COVID where foreign disinformation_
_campaigns pushed anti-vaccination messages through social media platforms, leading to drop_
_in mean vaccination coverage. And with the rise of generative AI, there is potential that the_
_spread of mis and disinformation through the internet will only get worse. The Bill strikes the_
_right balance between freedom of expression and preventing the spread of harmful content_
_online. Online platforms already have measures in place to manage mis and disinformation_
_through industry Codes – the Bill will just make sure that this process is systematic, regular and_
_transparent. The Coalition supported this type of regulation when it was in government and_
_had committed to hold social media giants to account before the last election.”_

Dr Becky White:

_“Transparency is important, both on the part of the platforms and on how the Bill is being_
_implemented and monitored - maybe this is still to come. I’d be interested in hearing how the_
_public can participate, will there systems for them to highlight concerns, what actually triggers_
_the platforms being requested to produce evidence on action, is this routine or triggered by an_
_action, and what information will be made public? I also agree about the input into serious_
_harm as it’s not clear how broad a view it would take or how the assessment is made. More_
_broadly from a public health perspective, misinformation and disinformation is important but_
_it’s one part of how people navigate the information environment. There are lots of other_
_components to consider when considering how misinformation impacts communities and how_
_it can be mitigated.”_

Mr Glen Ramos

_“The Exposure Draft Bill is an important step in addressing the current onslaught of_
_misinformation and disinformation which has serious negative impacts on the health of the_
_Australian community through undermining trust in public health communications, activities,_
_and engagement. However, given that it is only really addressing matters that are already in_
_the public domain, there are serious concerns that its effectiveness may not be as impactful as_
_hoped. Significant and immediate efforts have to be made in addressing the broader_
_determinants in which misinformation and information are created and exist with a particular_
_focusing on preventive actions such as building health literacy and supporting those most at_
_risk. The exclusion of government entities from the content scope of the Exposure Draft Bill_
_may also raise eyebrows and concerns. In particular this may serve to inadvertently undermine_
_trust and solidarity in government public health activities in times of emergency, disaster, or as_
_we have recently seen with COVID-19, pandemics.”_

Croakey thanks and acknowledges all who have contributed to this submission and related

discussions and events.
