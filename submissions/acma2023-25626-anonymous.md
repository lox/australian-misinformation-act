RE:- Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

WITH RESPECT                                                    23-7-23

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
There is a simple fallacy in this Proposed Bill and reason why it should be dropped altogether.

Excluding Government is tantamount to saying members of the Government are not
Australian citizens and therefore not subject to the Australian Constitution.

As we all know proof of Australian citizenship is a prerequisite to be elected into Parliament.

To exclude members of the Government as Section 2-27(e) does would require a change to
our Constitution and all that it entails - referendums etc.

Again as we all know from the present endeavour by our aboriginal folk to have a Voice in
Parliament, changing the Constitution is not an easy thing to do.

Mind you with the greatest of respect sometimes I do have a great deal of trouble believing
some of our politicians are Australian citizens due to decisions they make and feel they would
be far happier living in a country that is more amenable to their thinking.

Sincerely,


-----
