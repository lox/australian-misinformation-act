To Whom It May Concern:

While the intention to combat these issues is commendable it is crucial to critically evaluate the
potential consequences and implications it may have on our Democracy.

Granting the Government exclusive authority to determine the truth raises concerns about transparency,
accountability and suppression of diverse perspectives.

We have witnessed during the Covid pandemic, our inaccuracies and the dismissal of alternative view
points led to a significant harm and societal division.

In a democratic society it is vital to protect the rights of the individuals to seek and to interpret
information independently. Placing such powers in the hands of the Government, undermines the
principles of free speech, critical thinking and individual agencies that underpin our democracy.

I urge you to carefully reconsider the implications of this bill and ensure that any implemented safeguard will ensure the democratic values we hold dear.

Let us work together to create an environment where truth is reserved through open dialogue, diversity
of opinions and empowerment of individuals to make informed decisions.
