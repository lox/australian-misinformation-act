## New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

My understanding is that following quote is found in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights. "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to
hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers".

In my opinion the proposed legislation will do away with the human right to think and express
oneself without hinderance or penalty. I consider that such legislation, if passed into law, would be
both invalid and illegal, given it overrides basic human rights. I fail to see how citizens could obey the
proposed legislation in good conscience and actively participate in a democracy.

In my opinion the philosophy behind the proposed legislation is collectivist in nature and actively
deprecates the rights of those with contrary opinions. It is my opinion that the proposed legislation
will supress the right to free speech and directly undermine the building blocks of our Australian
democracy.

I respectfully request that the Australian Parliament does not pass the misinformation and
disinformation bill.
