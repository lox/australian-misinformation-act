Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I strongly reject this proposed legislation. The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”.
But the government will cause harm by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the
rights of the individual, not suppressing them.

One of the pillars of democracy is freedom of speech, thought and expression
To suppress the above is a clear assault on our liberty and fundamental rights
The answer to wrong speech , bad speech    - is more speech!    - open discussion and collaboration of thoughts and
ideas     - NOT     - suppression of speech if it does not fit the ‘in’ narrative
In this present day      - digital platforms are the main way to express thoughts, ideas , facts

A binding code which you propose the digital platforms like Face book to provide   - and then if they don’t comply
ACMA will provide   - is a dangerous extension of a totalitarianism of agenda   - and then the ACMA will rely on fact
checkers    - which have a selective use of data to ensure their opinion on what they decide is correct!
Discussion is intrinsic to our modern day society and in Australia we have an enduring democracy underpinned by our
Judeo- Christian heritage    - it must continue
Furthermore    - If your thoughts , ideas, discussion has already been ‘banned’ and taken down on Face Book    - nothing
in this legislation allows for      - you knowing why, no transparency of process and no appeals process
This is allowing a Government agency to decide a code of ethics which best fits the ‘going’ agenda of the day

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” should cause grave concerns
about this bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from
getting and spreading the virus. Those who questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media. Yet it soon
became obvious to everyone the government was wrong, and the “misinformation” was right! Nearly every Australian
was vaccinated for Covid-19, yet the virus kept spreading until almost every Australian caught it!

The rationale for censorship on this issue might have been well-intentioned. But time proved the censor-happy
bureaucrats wrong.

This one example shows why giving the government even more power is a recipe for disaster.

This bill must be thrown out.
