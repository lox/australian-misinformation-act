To Whom it may concern,

This ‘Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023’ has so many flaws and potential for abuse.

I think that pre-WW2 Germany would have loved it.

This bill is exactly what we want IF we are planning on going down the path to no longer being a
democracy.

No freedom of speech. No Freedom to think for ourselves. No freedom to verbalise what we are
thinking.

Who is it that decides what is truth? Indeed from culture to culture, from decade to decade truth has
changed. Freedom is about the ability to be and believe and act in a way that we believe is right. And
you want to create a rule that will remove our freedom. This is communism all over again.

Who is it that has power to incriminate others because of what they believe, or because they have
allowed others to have a voice? This is so wrong on so many levels.

I say NO to this bill.
