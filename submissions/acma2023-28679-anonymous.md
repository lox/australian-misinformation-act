SUBMISSION:

# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
 and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Committee:

Please see my feedback as requested on the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This bill will destructive to Australian democracy and must not pass.

I am grateful to be an Australian citizen, having come from a country where free speech
that opposed the government of the day saw people fined, imprisoned and killed, in the
name of protecting the peoples from harm.

The “peoples” were the privileged that did not stand in opposition to the government
injustice, and the “harm” was the fight for equality from Apartheid.

I have seen how silencing opposing opinions has lead to dictatorial regimes around the
world, the irony is that the government proposing this silence states that it is in the interest
of the people.

Truth is like water, given time, it will always make its way through to the surface.

**My feedback and thoughts on this proposed bill are outlined below this letter.**
Please prevent this bill from passing, it will cause more division and harm than it tries to
solve.

Thank you for giving us, the citizens, this opportunity to present our thoughts and concerns
in a submission. This ability to make a submission is exactly why Australian democracy
works, this proposed bill will erode our democracy.

Yours Sincerely

SUBMISSION POINTS AT ISSUE

The proposed bill summary states:

_“The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and_
_Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Cth) is the Albanese Government’s proposed law to combat_
_online ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ which allegedly ‘pose a threat to the safety and_
_wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy’. If passed, the_
_Bill will empower the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to compel_
_online service providers to censor online speech that it considers to be ‘harmful’. ACMA_
_will also have the power to impose significant penalties on online service providers.”_

1. **Who decides what is misinformation and disinformation? In 1933 the information**
of the day was contained in books. Those books which were considered disagreeable
(misinformation) to the government of the day were burned (Pre war Nazi Germany).
From the silencing of freedom of speech, it was a short road to all out discrimination,
murder and war.

# • When did a government or agency of that government, become the arbiter of what is

misinformation and disinformation?

# • What happens when the government mandated “truth” is provably factually false and

harmful? Will reparations be made to those who have suffered under this bill?

2. Who decides what truth is? I have a well founded concern that the “truth of the day”
will be determined by the policy of the government of the day.

# • Fact Checkers are opinionated and biased by the narrative, these fact checkers are

also paid by the organisations or bodies that require a particular outcome.

# • “Experts” can be found to support any view and resort to selective use of data to

support their findings.

# • For example, it is now widely accepted that much of the approved information about

Covid from authority organisations early in the pandemic has now been proved to be
incorrect. Actions to flatten the curve; such as masks, social distancing, lockdowns,
showed little benefit but at the time these actions were put forward as fact.

# • For example, the official information stated strenuously that the Covid 19 virus

originated in a Wuhan wet market, that theory that was proposed as truth (by “expert”
scientists) has subsequently been repealed. (Lancet journal report among others on
the origin of Covid)

**3. How will my freedom of speech be protected from this bill? This bill is a direct**
assault on our free speech. The Universal declaration of human rights - section 18 and 19
protects free speech, Australia is a signatory of this declaration but this bill stands in direct
opposition of The Universal declaration of human rights.

# • Democracy is at its heart, debate and disagreement trying to reach common ground in

the interest of the people first and foremost. This bill will take Australia further toward an
Orwellian dictatorship where any opposing view will be labelled disinformation /
misinformation and the proposer of the opposing view will be silenced. Silencing
opposition has been the primary vehicle of communist dictatorships. Freedom of
thought, opinion and freedom of discussion is fundamental to our Australian heritage

# • Is not open discussion and debate the foundation of getting to the truth?
 • Freedom of conscience, freedom to speak, freedom make right / wrong decisions is one

of the many benefits of living in a FREE democratic society.

# • The bill asserts that people are unable to think for themselves and make decisions

about what is truth and what is misinformation and disinformation.

**3. How will my freedom of Religion be protected from this bill? The bill refers to**
Misinformation being false, misleading or deceptive and contribute to harm, stipulating
causing hatred toward a group.
My faith teaches that it is in love and wanting to do the best for people that we speak out
for the oppressed and against injustice. There are groups who already deem our views as
“hatred toward a group”.

# • If the teachings of my religion stand in opposition to the policy of the government, will

my religion then be deemed misinformation / disinformation?

# • This is exactly what North Korea and Communist China have done with my faith.
 • How long until all faiths are considered mis-information?

**4. Why is this bill discriminatory? This bill has exemptions for government, main stream**
media and organisations not in opposition of the governments position. If implemented all
sectors of society should be held to account for spreading Misinformation and
Disinformation.

# • The “truth” in the main stream media is more representative of which truth camp has

deeper pockets and more power.

# • What will happen to opposition politicians if they express an opinion or argue a topic that

has been declared Misinformation and Disinformation?

# • If citizens disagree with government policy, pseudo science or cultural directions, will

their opinions, evidence or alternative world view be shut down under this bill.

**5. Let the law do its job. Australia has a functioning legal system. If there is deemed to**
be harm caused by Misinformation and Disinformation, there would be a case to prosecute
and defend.

# • Misinformation guidance note example - Incitement to commit hate crimes must be dealt

with by criminal law, not by a subjective interpretation by ACMA

# • Misinformation guidance note example - Undermining the AEC. There are laws in place

to protect our electoral system, if needs be, expand the law if new issues arise.

# • Misinformation guidance note example - dangerous drugs. The case cited was an

untested alternate Covid treatment. Dangerous drugs of all kinds need to be dealt with
under health laws, there are new treatments coming to light all the time such as CBD oil,
it is being managed by health laws, none of this should be managed by ACMA.

Time will reveal the truth, leave debate alone and let time expose the misinformation. This
bill will destroy our democracy, our freedoms and my faith. Thank you for considering my
submission.
