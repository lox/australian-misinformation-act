##### Dear Sir / Madam,

I am greatly concerned about the _Combating_ _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation_ _Bill_ proposed
##### by the Albanese Government.
 This bill proposes powers that will threaten freedom of speech and democratic rights in Australia in the following ways:

### i. the Bill grants the government the authority to define “truth”, allowing it to
##### control and manipulate the flow of information;

2. the Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority
##### (ACMA) to determine what qualifies as “misinformation” or
###### “disinformation”. This subjective definition leaves room for abuse of
##### power, and suppresses diverse opinions and public debate;

3. the Bill excludes the government and mainstream media from its
##### censorship regime, creating a double standard and eroding the principles of fairness and equality;

4. the Bill effectively enables tech companies to become tools of government
##### censorship, stifling free speech and undermining the open exchange of ideas; and

5. the Bill paves the way for ideological conformity, suppressing dissenting
##### voices and hindering independent thought. This goes against the principles of a democratic society that thrives on diversity and freedom of expression.

I urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental rights
##### of every Australian citizen to freedom of opinion and expression provided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 My family and I vehemently oppose this democracy-cancelling Bill and will be most disappointed if the Government pursues it.
