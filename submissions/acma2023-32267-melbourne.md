I do not consent to the ACMA Misinformation and
Disinformation Bill being introduced. Absolutely NO!

The idea of such legislation being executed is an insult
to the intelligence of and assault on all good and
freedom loving people. Literature and historical
precedent illuminates this stupid proposal as a
backward and reckless step towards a totalitarian
state and a progressive slide down the slippery slopes
of censorship and the abuse of power. This bill may
appeal to the psychopaths who walk amongst us but
to those sane of mind and reasonable it is NOT a good
thing.

Grandiose delusions of power, though control and
weaponised truth â€“ blimey, what next!
