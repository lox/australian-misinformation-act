# Misinformation Disinformation submission.pdf ;

 Dear Sir,

 Attached is our written submission to oppose the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill. Please acknowledge receipt of this submission.

 Yours sincerely, Bruce and Janice Schubert

We strongly oppose the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill because it will suppress the opinion
of all those who do not agree with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). It
will decree that the ACMA view on every issue is the absolute truth, and therefore debate will be
prohibited. No person on the earth knows absolute truth, only God who created everything can lay
claim to that. People make mistakes, but without freedom of speech and debate these mistakes will
never be revealed. Take for example those cases where people have been tried and sentenced to jail
based on invalid information, then finally when the real truth is revealed sometimes decades later
they are found to have been innocent all along. Imagine that on a national level where every
individual in the community can suffer wrongly because the judge and jury (in this case the ACMA)
got it wrong.

This bill is an attack on free speech as never seen before in Australia. It blatantly violates the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in article 19 states “everyone has the right to freedom
of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The Labor party want this bill in place because they want a dictatorship. If passed then anybody who
holds a view that opposes them will be classed as spreading misinformation or disinformation and
deemed as a law breaker. The assumption here is the ACMA and ultimately the government of the
day are flawless, but the reality is that governments make bad judgements on a regular basis. If they
got it right first time every time then there would be no need to be continually amending and fine
tuning the laws.

As I understand it, the bill will restrict information on digital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram,
Google, and Netflix. This is how most people these days communicate. Old school media like
newspapers and free to air Television are slowly being phased out, how convenient? Of course
government communications will be exempted from the Bill, again how very convenient?

Let’s run a scenario on a previously debated topic and see how this bill, if in place back then would
have affected the outcome. We were all asked to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on gay marriage. The government
of the day were pushing it and prominent politicians would boldly get up publically accusing anybody
opposed to it as being homophobic. Homophobic means you are against the homosexual act, but
the referendum was about the institution of marriage and the values it stands for, not about the
sexual orientation of individuals. Those politicians where deliberately spreading misinformation and
disinformation to further their own agenda.

In this country there is supposed to exist freedom of religion, but during that time those who stood
by their beliefs that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman were publically
attacked. If this bill was law back then, then those who opposed the government’s stand on gay
marriage and spoke out would be classed as criminals because their version of truth conflicted with
the government’s desired new version of truth. In the process the right to religious freedom is
suppressed and every practising Christian or Muslim in Australia instantly becomes victimised should
they dare to voice an opposing opinion. How can any politician who genuinely is in office to serve all
Australians allow that to happen? The answer to that question is simple; they are in office to
promote their own agendas and to hell with anybody who disagrees with them. Dictatorship, that’s
where we are heading. The outrageous lock downs and suppression of freedom of choice during the
COVID19 pandemic was living proof of the push for dictatorship by governments. Stand against them

on whatever grounds and you will be severally penalised, that is the new sad reality in Australia
today.

Now let’s look at a current agenda the government wants to promote, namely the Indigenous Voice
to Parliament. We already have the debate on this issue bias toward the government’s “Yes”
campaign, by way of one sided benefits such as tax deductions and media coverage. If only that was
all, but of course we have the racist card played against those who publicly oppose. To give one
group of people special privileges based solely on their heritage is the definition of racism. Okay, so
the definition defines the truth on the matter, surely that is how it should be, but when
disinformation comes into play the lie becomes the new truth. The “yes” campaigners want to
permanently divide the country on race, yet they call those who oppose them racists. They are
enforcing the lie as the new truth, and try to swap identities. With regard to the voice it gets even
worse, because the government will not give details of how the voice will work, which is deliberately
withholding information. By not supplying information on the details they can repute any claim
against their cause by simply saying the arguments against are misinformation or disinformation.
What a powerful and underhanded tactic they use. Then, as a result of not having the information
supplied, the public search for whatever information they can get. Those in favour of the “no”
campaign submit what they believe to be true, but purely because their argument opposes the
government’s stand they are labelled with all sorts of names and personal attacks, all under the
justification that “you don’t know what you are talking about”, or in other words by accusing them
of spreading misinformation even though without the “yes” campaigns details it cannot be proven if
the “no” campaign’s argument is truthful or not.

Now from a different tact, let us explore this from a different angle. As everyone knows and DNA
tests prove, that every individual has a gender of either male or female. That’s the truth in its
absolute form, but some group in a position of authority have now redefined that absolute truth to
say that gender is floating. A boy can now be a girl and a girl can be a boy or somehow they can now
lose their gender altogether and become neutral, or double up and become both, I think that’s
called transgender. This is a real example that has come into play in very recent years where people
in authority can deliberately take what is absolute truth and distort it to be an absolute lie, and then
relabel the absolute lie as the new truth. And why? For their own agendas. The following is an
extract from a Google search on the birth certificate laws currently in Australia, “A person's gender
identity may not always be exclusively male or female and may not always correspond with their sex
assigned at birth. The majority of Australian states and territories already permit birth certificates
that record an individual's sex as something other than male or female.” According to this new truth,

have a DNA test for gender it will always still be

only either male or female. How screwed up have we become as a society. This insanity must stop
now.

Freedom of speech must be upheld as a right for every individual. It is part of our democratic
system. This bill however will stop freedom of speech in its tracks, and every bad and unjust law will
be implemented unopposed, because the voice of reason will be prohibited.

Can you imagine the bias unfair and unjust laws that will be introduced if this bill is adopted as law?
God help this nation, because the reigning government are hell bent on removing all our rights and


-----

freedoms. We can only hope that good will prevail over evil, because make no doubt about it the
legislation in this bill is abominable and must be voted down for the sake of all future generations.
