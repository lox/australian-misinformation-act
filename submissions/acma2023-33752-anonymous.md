Re: Communications Legislation Amendment

(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

The Bill, if passed in its current form, would allow the Australian Communications
and Media Authority (ACMA) substantial, unilateral and discretionary authority to
govern all forms of media save those explicitly excepted from the Bill’s operation.
Such law would render Australia’s commitment to freedom of speech and expression
meaningless.

This Bill, if passed, will make Australia a communist country similar to China or Nort
Korea where people are coerced into obeying the government’s orders and there is
life-threatening consequences if they disobey.

To start with, according to the 1901 Commonwealth Constitution, the Parliament
doesn’t seem to have the power to legislate this bill in reference to Section 51 & 52
of the Constitution where it defines POWERS OF THE PARLIAMENT. Could you
please answer my question, “Where and who is the head of the power to introduce
and legislate this bill?”

Also apart from God, who gets to decide what is misinformation and disinformation?

I have seen instances where the authorities related to the government have not been
correct, especially in the last 3 years. People were coerced into taking COVID
vaccines to keep the society safe and anyone giving critical view about safety and
efficacy of the vaccines were attacked, but later Pfizer executive publicly said in
European Parliament that vaccine does not stop catching or spreading of COVID.

We will not be allowed to have any debate or public protest if this Bill passed. We
should have the right to hear various opinions on any matters and it’s up to us to
discern what is right for us.

I’m against this bill that will sink Australia into a total communist country. Also please
show and prove that the Parliament has the power to legislate this bill.

Best regards.
