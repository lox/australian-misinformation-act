###### submission concerning Misinformation Bill

**From:**

**To:** InformationmIntegrity <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>

**Date:** Sat, 19 Aug 2023 21:29:22 +1000

I am greatly concerned by the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 and its potential impact on free speech.

The necessity of this legislation is certainly questionable when speech crimes such as defamation and inciting
violence are already outlawed. The startling difference between this bill and these existing laws is that it can
effectively be used to shut down all kinds of lawful discussions about social issues. Some examples include the
discussion regarding biological men being able to identify as female and enter women’s private spaces, global
warming, the safety of vaccines, etc. To me, the bill’s primary purpose seems to be the eradication of political beliefs
deemed contrary to the mainstream.

This bill has also unsurprisingly chosen the most effective form of censorship     - threatening private companies with
massive fines if they are caught allowing so-called “mis/disinformation” on their platforms. Indeed, threats of large
fines will result in much more censorship than if this bill simply sought to prosecute individuals. Having private
corporations simply cancel people’s accounts is also much safer for the government compared to confronting
individuals and risking being called out for governmental overreach.

The definitions contained in the draft bill are also outrageously vague and subjective. It loosely defines harm as hate
speech, disruption of public order, harm to government, harm to public health, the environment, and economy (p.10).
This is a broader attack on free speech than anything hitherto     - including not just harm to people but “to the Australian
environment” as well! Another concerning part of this definition of harm is the word “disruption”, which could easily be
weaponised to prevent legitimate robust debate or to censor any political views which are opposed to ruling
orthodoxy.

The hope that this bill will be used only for good    - when it can so easily be used for unjust censorship    - I think is
naive. Anyone who has studied history should know that we can never afford to put our trust in the inherent good of
any leadership group when there are no proper safeguards in place.

Thank you for considering my submission. I hope you will be convinced that freedom of speech and the open
exchange of ideas are non-negotiable.

Yours faithfully,

###### concerns regarding draft Combatting Misinformation Bill

**From:**

**To:** InformationmIntegrity <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>

**Date:** Sat, 19 Aug 2023 21:25:56 +1000

As my submission to the inquiry into the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding this draft legislation.

Whilst some may believe that the solution to “misinformation” or “disinformation” is more centralised control, I believe
that it is far better to let people share their beliefs, respectfully disagree, debate on issues, and make up their own
minds about matters.

This draft bill, however, will effectively shut down the sharing of many ideas and create so much legal uncertainty for
online platforms that they will be forced to censor anything which might be considered controversial.

This would be disastrous because throughout human history, hotly contested or even nearly universally disbelieved
ideas have turned out, years later, to be the truth. For example, many scientific discoveries now enshrined as facts     -
such as the spherical Earth, the circulation of blood through the body, the sun as the centre of the solar system, etc.    -
were nearly unanimously opposed by almost all the leading scientists of the time. Who is to say that similar things do
not occur today?

This is why we cannot trust the ability of a mere handful people to make decisions about what should or should not be
classed as misinformation or disinformation     - and why this draft bill must either be dumped or at least heavily revised
to remedy the major flaws it is built upon.

###### This bill is lacking in sufficient safeguards against misuse of censorship powers

**From:**

**To:** InformationmIntegrity <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>

**Date:** Sat, 19 Aug 2023 21:35:46 +1000

I wish to make a submission about the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This bill tramples on freedom of speech by compelling big tech to silence discussion which     - even unintentionally-
causes “harm” to such a broad range of targets that almost anything can be construed as such. This bill defines no
clear standard, but instead relies upon online platforms to play it as safe-as-possible to remove whatever could be
potentially be labelled “mis/disinformation” before they get fined for not doing so.

But even a cursory look at history reveals that many ideas which were unpopular, controversial, or even universally
condemned later turned out to be true! Humanity has not become infallible since then and people still make mistakes.
Just recently, for example, during the pandemic, there are many instances of so-called facts which even
governmental departments were later forced to back-track on.

It should be clear that this bill is lacking sufficient clarity and accountability as well as safeguards against the misuse
of censorship powers. Moreover, the exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is
hypocritical and inconsistent and will establish one standard for government and another standard for ordinary
Australians in terms of what each can say.

I therefore encourage the Department to instead explore alternative approaches which focus on empowering
individuals with critical thinking skills. Education and awareness campaigns     - not heavy-handed regulation which
infringes upon fundamental freedoms     - should be favoured if we wish to preserve any semblance of democracy.

Yours sincerely,

###### Free and unrestricted exchange of ideas is essential to healthy society

**From:**

**To:** InformationmIntegrity <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>

**Date:** Sat, 19 Aug 2023 21:40:35 +1000

Please accept my submission regarding the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023:

Firstly, I believe that there is a great danger in framing legislation which contains politically-loaded, unnecessarily
broad, and highly subjective definitions. The definition of harm in the proposed bill, for example, encompasses
anything deemed hateful, disruptive, or harmful to a wide range of personal attributes or entities such as gender,
sexuality, the environment, people’s health, etc. As a Christian, I worry that this legislation could be used particularly
to target religious platforms or individuals who hold religious beliefs     - as these often contain traditional views
regarding marriage, gender, and sexual ethics. Furthermore, restricting speech resulting in “Harm to the Australian
environment” could preclude Australians’ right to freely question and debate extremely important phenomena and
policies which could severely impact all our lifestyles like “global warming”, “climate change”, and Net Zero policies.

Inexplicably, but very conveniently for the major networks, ACMA’s restrictions on misinformation and disinformation
will exclude “professional news content”      - with another exclusion being “content that is authorised by the
Commonwealth; or a State; or a Territory; or a local government.” I find that these exclusions are utterly hypocritical.

It is my belief that a healthy, functioning democracy requires freedom of speech, which means that ideas from across
the ideological and political spectrum can be discussed and debated by anyone. This is why I respectfully urge you to
consider both the alarming scope and potentially very serious implications of this bill     - and so accordingly recommend
its complete revision.

Yours faithfully,

Kathy
