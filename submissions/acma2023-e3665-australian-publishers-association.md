Email: clientservice@infrastructure.gov.au

Dear Review Secretariat

**RE: Australian Publishers Association: submission to the Department of**
**Industry’s consultation on proposed new ACMA powers to combat**
**misinformation and disinformation**

**Preamble:**

The Australian Publishers Association (APA) is pleased to accept the Department of Infrastructure,
Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts invitation to contribute to this
consultation on proposed new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

**The Value of Publishers: Publishers play a critical role in bringing the best written works to**
readers worldwide. They add value through informed processes of selection, in some genres
involving peer review, as well as editorial improvements, production, promotion, distribution, and
sales. Our members publish not only the latest novels and beloved Australian classics, but a vast
array of cultural and knowledge works, including biographies, cookbooks, gardening guides,
how-to manuals, histories, young adult fiction, picture books, scientific journals, and more.

The APA represents over 200 Australian publishers, who account for more than 90% of the
country's $2 billion annual book industry turnover. Each year, around 20,000 new Australian books
of all types are published, along with tens of thousands of international titles that are released in
Australian editions or imported into the country. The Australian book industry provides access to
over 1.4 million book and serial titles to meet the needs of a diverse range of readers, including
families, students, educators, researchers, and industry professionals.

**The importance of safeguarding the quality of information in the public realm and in the**
**scientific realm:**

In an era dominated by digital information, quality scientific publications have never been more
crucial. These publications undergo rigorous peer-review, ensuring their content is credible,
evidence-based, and contributes meaningfully to the existing body of knowledge. Accordingly,
Australia publishers, particularly but not only scientific, technical and medical (STM) publishers,
applaud the federal government efforts to improve legislation aimed at protecting the quality of


-----

information and discussion in both the public and scare committed to the production and
scientific spheres.

In contrast, misinformation (false or misleading information shared without harmful intent) and
disinformation (false information shared with the intention to deceive) have proliferated, often
amplified by social media. These not only mislead the public but also erode trust in genuine
scientific endeavours.

Quality scientific publications act as a beacon of truth in a sea of falsehoods. They provide a
foundation for policy decisions, educational curricula, and public opinion. In the face of challenges
like global pandemics and climate change, relying on accurate scientific information is
imperative. As misinformation and disinformation muddy the waters, upholding the integrity of
scientific publications is paramount for societal progress.

**Concern about the specifics of the drafting of the legislation**

While the APA welcomes the legislation and is confident that it is not the intention of the
legislation to regulate the high quality information circulated by Australian publishers, we
recommend that

 - The definition of a “digital platform provider” should be clarified to exclude the digital
platforms used by educational publishers to provide learning materials and services to
schools, VET and universities.

 - As an extension of this the definition of excluded content should include text books and
online learning materials.

 - The definition of a “digital platform provider” should be clarified to exclude the digital
platform developed by trade publishers to host book club discussions.
