 I am vehemently against any government agency or bureaucracy determining what is "Good Think" and what is "Bad Think!" We were promised a Royal Commission into responses to the Covid 19 Pandemic. Online any critics who suggested that the virus could have been manipulated in the Wuhan Laboratory was labelled a "Conspiracy theory." Mandatory Vaccination is counter to UN declarations on the right to determine one's medical interventions. Today Monday the 31st of July 2023, confirms Australian scientists had serious concerns that this Virus was the result of gain of function experimentation. That suspicion was suppressed and censored. Over 10,000 Australians died with Covid 19. State borders were shut when this is clearly not the intention of our Constitution. Martial Law edicts were enacted in peacetime in contravention of the Petition of Rights in the Magna Carta. Political interference in information and news is commonplace. Despite Billions of dollars of expenditure there has been no ongoing investigation into the claims of a "Climate Catastrophe" even though in 1990 the proponents of that conspiracy suggested the polar ice caps would melt in 10 years! Political interference in debate and censorship is anti- democratic. Something one may not question is not a, "Science" it is a religion and act of faith! We have other "Scientific" opinions which are not properly scrutinized such as "Gender Fluidity," the consequences of which can be devastating. Other policy blunders have been made when we do not question proclamations such as "Saddam Hussein" has Weapons of Mass Destruction, and we must go to war! Osama Bin Laden was not found in Afghanistan however Australian servicemen spent 15 years fighting a war and insurgency there based on this false assertion! When we consider the Eddie Obeid corruption scandal, had he been able to suppress investigative journalism we may assume his corruption may never have been investigated. For reasons as indicated above being examples of how often information is manipulated for political gain, or to bury scandal and controversy, I do not believe in censorship. 

 We need to have far better controls on the use of Artificial Intelligence which may manipulate opinion and elections, There are serious moral and ethical considerations in the use of social media. One very concerning issue is the use of human Resources and recruiting firms and individuals to view and make determinations on the suitability of a candidate based on their social media profile. HR people and younger HR professionals tend to have

### affiliations and posts online. This now allows our public service to only hire candidates expressing Left leaning political ideologies. In the instance of the proposed voice that may exclude the majority of candidates as over 50% as of the date of writing this, are opposed to the proposal. If you express a view that our immigration policy is too lenient, that the “Voice” is anathema to a democracy, you are unlikely to be selected for an interview in any government department, at local, state or Federal level. This also is an issue with ageism as information systems filter out those with traditionally held views and is a serious reason many over 45 find it much harder to gain employment than those under 45.

 So social media searches and posts, HR practices are already stilting our employment practices and contributing in a very real sense to ageism in the workplace. The very discrimination our governments have declared they would not do. Allowing “Thought Police” to determine what is offensive and what is not has silenced criticism in many cases. Israel Folau and his sacking from a professional sporting organization is another example of overreach. Our current privacy laws do not protect potential candidates from young HR people’s discriminatory attitudes to older and more conservative people. This is a calamity and a national disgrace. I entirely oppose any censorship and prefer only violent expression or calls for violence to be censored. 

 Any censorship panel or “Thought Police” should include a broad range of opinion, a diversity of age and maturity in the panel. Governments policies which relied on “Science” and factors which are found to be falsely made, should be required to compensate those affected by their decisions. This would include “Climate Catastrophism” and “Covid 19 Zealotry.” Prejudices of young HR professionals has relegated decades of mature employees to a premature career end, this is not equitable, honest or fair.

Yours faithfully,
