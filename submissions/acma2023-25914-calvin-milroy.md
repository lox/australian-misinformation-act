# RE: the New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

As an Australian citizen, after reviewing the above-mentioned exposure draft Bill, I am
advising the government to reject the draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I believe that we need to protect
the rights of Australians, therefore I do not support this proposed act as it does not support
freedom of speech which is vital to democracy within Australia.
