**A Submission of the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

**General**
I am concerned that this bill aims to suppress free speech and the publication of the
sincerely held opinions of average citizens.

As the following examples illustrate, the framework for judging what is 'true' and what is
'misinformation' will be defined by core Government policy: those that agree with
Government policy will be speaking 'truth'; those that express opposing views will be
spreading misinformation.

The power to determine what is true and punish those speaking what is considered to
be false is the hallmark of totalitarianism, and has no place in a modern democracy.

Whilst we all agree that spreading misinformation with malicious intent is undesirable
(e.g. people making hoax bomb phone calls), we must also recognise the rights of an
individual to express an opinion, even if that goes contrary to established Government
policy. This distinction is not marked out sufficiently (if at all) in this proposed legislation.

Surely it is adequate to make the public aware that everything they hear or read is an
opinion unless stated otherwise.

**What is true?**
'Combatting misinformation and disinformation' implies that the bill is setting out an
agenda for determining what is true. Note that philosophers have been trying to
determine 'truth' for thousands of years, and yet the quest goes on.

Any logician will tell you that the 'truth' of a conclusion is dependent on the soundness
of the argument that leads to it and is ultimately dependent on the truth of the
premises (what is accepted to be true to start with). The premises are of course the
result of arguments based on premises etc. and the regression goes on endlessly.

It is also to be noted that whilst 80% of surveyed Australians want 'truth in advertising',
they tend to be referring to the stream of lies and misinformation that politicians spout
during election campaigns. Yet this bill expressly exempts Governments from the reach
of the bill.

**Example 1: In November 2022 federal MP Zoe Steggall called for $50,000 fines to be**
imposed on people who say that the proposed Aboriginal Voice to Parliament would
constitute a third chamber of parliament.

To label the Voice to Parliament as a 'third chamber' is an example of a metaphor. And
the ability of the human mind to construct metaphors is one of the foundational human
abilities that has led to the development of civilization. To ban metaphor is to try and
turn the evolutionary clock back millions of years.

**Who determines 'truth'?**
The notion that the ACMA (Australian Communication and Media Authority) should be
the ultimate arbiter of truth is alarming. The following is an example of how they
monitor the Australian ABC and its Code of Practice. They are basically standing up for
Government policy rather than policing the ABC's adherence to its code of practice.

**Example 2. In December 2022 I complained to ABC News that they had failed to provide**
any coverage of International Men's Day (19[th] November) for the past two years, whilst
their coverage of International Women's Day seems to go on all year.

The ABC Code of Practice states in Part IV, Section, relating to impartiality and diversity
of perspectives covered, that in presenting current issues, 'no significant strand of
thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately
represented.'

The ABC replied that their failure to advertise International Men's Day was a
'programming' issue and not covered by their code of practice.

I took my complaint to the ACMA and they supported the ABC stance, adding that
'programming decisions' are beyond the remit of the ACMA.

The ACMA is here inventing a distinction between what is shown on the ABC and what is
excluded on an editorial levelâ€”a distinction that is absent from the ABC Code of
Practice. If this is an example of the ACMA being an 'arbiter of truth' we should all be
worried about the state of our democracy.
