“Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth” – Albert Einstein[1]

The above quote distills in just ten words a powerful truth that should be a fundamental tenet of our
society but one that seems to have been forgotten by our politicians and bureaucrats.

In the decades post the end of the Cold War, it has been generally understood in the modern West that
free speech trumps censorship, the latter being seen as the domain of authoritarian regimes such as the
Soviet Union, enforced via intimidation, coercion and political violence. Free speech should therefore
be a celebrated bastion of liberal western democracies, a concept to undergird our public discourse,
media landscape and academic endeavour.

I start with these points as the stated purpose of this new ACMA ‘Online Safety’ bill is said to be to oblige
online platforms to implement:

“[…] _stronger tools to empower users to identify and report misinformation and_
_disinformation, ensure more robust complaints handling, and enable more extensive use_
_of fact checkers”[2],_

none of which is remotely conducive to an environment championing free speech when only certain
people get to define what those concepts mean.

In the past few years in particular, Western politicians, media entities and others who _consider_
themselves thought leaders have increasingly deemed it necessary to deconstruct the concept of free
speech itself, determining that in our modern social media era, a select few gatekeepers in official
positions should determine what is or isn’t “inappropriate”, what is or isn’t accurate “information”, what
is or isn’t a “fact” and what is or isn’t “harmful”, that a nebulous network of nitpickers should be engaged
to police the online marketplace of ideas.

What makes it worse however is that speech is adjacent to thought, and what is increasingly obvious
these days is that thinking for oneself is increasingly considered “problematic” by those who most wish
to control the flow of ideas.

Multiple credentialed news sites and media platforms since 2020 have broadcast segments, published
articles or even cited academic studies decrying the dangers of “thinking for oneself”, a great example
being this pearler from Australia’s “The Conversation” from August 2022, aptly titled:

“Vaccine hesitancy: Why ‘doing your own research’ doesn’t work, but reason alone
_won’t change minds”[ 3],_

1 Letter to Jost Winteler (1901), quoted in The Private Lives of Albert Einstein by Roger Highfield and Paul Carter

snidely implying both that Covid vaccine hesitancy is anathema to reason, and that blind trust in
“experts” is the only appropriate response to a complex issue such as the Covid vaccines because the
average human is apparently deemed too much of a cretin to understand basic scientific concepts.[4]

Contrary to that author’s opinion, the importance of thinking critically, healthy skepticism and good oldfashioned orneriness is vital to knowledge-seeking, the great irony being that those in authority who
arrogated themselves unique foresight and “expert” knowledge were the ones who made uniquely poor
decisions throughout the pandemic[5].

By August 2022 it was perfectly obvious to anyone with functioning critical faculties (even if they had
initially been discombobulated during the initial waves of pandemic-laced hysteria) that practically
every aspect of the official Covid narrative and the Covid vaccine rollout in this country and elsewhere
was founded on a combination of incompetence, panic, greed, lies and corruption; at best a calamitous
miscalculation by honest actors and at worst a gigantic racket perpetrated by our governments,
partnering as they had with select pharmaceutical interests that profited financially to the tune of tens
of billions of dollars in the process[6].

Heck, as early as February 2021 it was apparent to anyone who had read it that the Emergency Use
_Authorisation (EUA) for_ Covid jab granted by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration was

an exercise in wishful thinking, clinical deception and data manipulation.[7] The TGA’s report quite literally
admits that its authors had no real idea about the efficacy of the jabs, acknowledging not just massive
gaps in the rushed trial data, but that clinical findings (which were accepted at face value)

wouldn’t necessarily translate to material real-world efficacy in the medium to long term, if at all[8].

In December 2020, the preeminent New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) had laid the groundwork
for this internationally by publishing its own “independent” study, ‘Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2
_mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine’[9], heralding_ Covid jab as safe and highly effective. This became the

official position of the WHO, leading governments, and global health “experts”, despite having a

hand in the study design, the data analysis, and the drafting of the manuscript, and its business partner,

4 At no stage were the Covid-19 vaccines tested for, or proven to prevent, the transmission of the virus, and yet
the media and government trumpeted the 95% effective narrative continuously. At best they are a therapy, with
the only publicly stated benefit now being that they reduce the risk of severe symptoms for those at risk of
serious infection.
5 Of course, they have investigated themselves and found that they did an amazing job
6 profits doubled from 2020 to 2022 from USD$30 to USD$60 billion. It helps when the WHO and national

governments monolithically advertise your medical products as mandatory, agreeing punitive, liability-free
sweetheart deals to buy 100’s of millions of doses of your products on the taxpayers’ dollar.
7

8 Of all the tacit mea culpas to emerge from the health establishment during the Covid era, the redefining of the
acceptable vaccine narrative from “2 doses will end the pandemic” in 2020 to “get a vaccine booster every 3-6
months because we actually know they don’t work very well” remains my favourite. How those who dutifully
lined up to receive their first Covid booster and then their next etc managed to reconcile the fact that they kept
catching Covid regardless remains a mystery to me. Purely by coincidence, the trusted authorities have now
redefined the covid vaccines as being an annual thing, shifting the goalposts yet again despite their being no
long-term safety or efficacy data proving that multiple repeated doses of an mRNA injection are appropriate.
Who needs safety data though when there’s vaccines to sell.

, providing the funding. Despite independent analysis of the vaccine trials being critical of its

study design and the published findings[10] – not to mention the obvious conflicts of interest on display –
“official” sources declared it to be proof that vaccine was a pandemic panacea. Publicly it

became heretical to state anything else, and the silencing of any rational critique as dangerous
“disinformation” became instrumental to the canonisation of the “no one is safe until we all get jabbed”
mantra.

Leaving this one example of many aside, it is alarming to consider the consequences for our polity should
censorious officials be allowed to legislate themselves ever more powers to compel dogmatic belief in
certain narratives, especially when promulgated under the guise of legislation purported to “combat
misinformation and disinformation”; among the greatest perpetrators of misinformation,
disinformation, subterfuge, gaslighting and outright lies in this country is the Australian government in
its various guises, departments, and affiliates, aided and abetted by numerous legacy media entities
that disseminate its messaging, not least the ABC, its chief enabler.

Why on earth should I trust the Communications Minister Michelle Rowland then when she states that
this legislation will be balanced against freedom of expression which is, in her words, “at the heart of
_democracy”?_

The government portrays itself as the bastion of truth and integrity, yet it has failed so often in recent
times to display the least semblance of transparency and impartiality that I find the prospect of this
legislation hypocritical and duplicitous in the extreme.

Numerous of our political leaders for example spent the better part of 2021 and 2022 making frequent
false and slanderous remarks about the “unvaccinated”, fueling apartheid-style rhetoric online and the
implementation of draconian measures to coerce Covid “vaccine” uptake, yet managed to convince
themselves and the media that none of their words or deeds could be construed as “harmful” because
the unvaccinated somehow deserved the vitriol politicians were spewing, merely for being circumspect,
thinking critically or not blindly doing as they were told. So much for freedom of expression.

Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Australian government (much like its counterparts in the US, UK, New
Zealand and Canada) relied heavily on a network of fact-checkers[11], the state broadcaster, academic
institutions, “nudge” units[12] and a panoply of tame media and social-media entities[13] to make sure that
the public was deliberately uninformed about practically all aspects of the Covid pandemic. The public
would not be allowed to make up their own minds about ongoing Covid developments, trends, statistics

10 https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037#T1
11 Anyone looking to understand the insidious nature of the “fact-checking” industry could do worse than review
Matt Taibbi’s expose on the Censorship Industrial Complex at https://www.racket.news/p/report-on-thecensorship-industrial-74b
12 That this was valorised by establishment scientific publications such as Nature says a lot. Deliberately
manipulating public perception by weaponising behavioural psychology at a societal level to coerce certain
behaviour is not OK. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03843-2
13 The amount of government money paid to media entities in this country and elsewhere throughout the Covid
pandemic to promote the official government line remains rather nebulous. Perhaps there will be an accounting
one day of just how many tens of millions were spent selling fear and paranoia under the guise of PING grants
and other “relief” programs launched by the government to support media during this period.

and data but were instead told what (and how) to think about events from the official perspective, no
matter how incoherent the message[14].

The public had to believe for example that Covid was an existential risk to everyone regardless of age or
underlying health[15], or that Covid “vaccines” were not just effective at stopping transmission but the
only path to pandemic salvation[16] (fueling the quixotic ‘Zero Covid’ policy so beloved of certain
Australian premiers). That the perfectly healthy should be locked down, or that natural immunity after
recovering from the illness suddenly ceased to be a scientific reality[17]. Let’s just say that these “official”
narratives, deemed monolithically irrefutable by the entire health establishment and repeated
relentlessly by the media for months on end, have thankfully been shown to be rather more than slightly
inaccurate since then.

One of the more egregious utterances by a government leader in this context was the example of exNew Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who saw fit to publicise her authoritarian tendencies by
professing in 2020 when discussing her government’s Covid planning: [18]

“You can trust us as a source of that information. You can also trust the Director
_General of Health and the Ministry of Health. […] Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We_
_will continue to be your single source of truth. […] Everything else you see [regard with]_
_a grain of salt.”_

In what sane world would any informed citizen choose to suspend their critical thinking and submit
themselves myopically to the dictates of their government being their single source of Truth? Did Ardern
really think so little of her citizens’ discernment or cognitive abilities? Should the public all just deny
their own minds and submit to authority?

Like Ardern, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, is a proud member[19] of that globalist,
elitist home of policy wonkery, the Davos-based _World Economic Forum (WEF), the secretive_

14 The “Pandemic of the Unvaccinated” myth is a great example, a catchphrase coined by Joe Biden and his CDC
director, Rochelle Walensky, designed not just to elicit a visceral fear response, but to provide a target of
peoples’ frustrations, a group of scapegoats to blame for the continuation of government lockdowns. What had
seemingly been overlooked of course by bloviating journalists was the fact that the various data and reports
alleging this claim were premature, temporal artifacts of the staggered vaccine rollouts and arbitrary public
health definitions of who was considered vaccinated and who was considered a “case”, and ignored the fact that
the underlying data for cases, hospital admissions and deaths according to publicly-available reporting from
various jurisdictions within a few months of the vaccine rollouts very quickly showed the exact opposite. It was
however politically incorrect to suggest otherwise, and of course served as a very useful propaganda tool for the
public health establishment.
15 It wasn’t. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33716331/
16 Weird how the experts at the US CDC now officially declare what was considered conspiracy theory through
2021 and 2022 under their latest advice for Managing COVID-19 Symptoms, namely “Most people with COVID19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines […] to
help you feel better.”
17 Reports like this were laughable at best but were published to persuade a gullible public that “vaccine”
immunity was magically far superior to that offered by natural immunity.

organisation whose primary mission seems to be to foster some sort of pseudo-philosophical societal
revolution whereby unelected (but well-connected) technocrats aim to “re-shape” society into a digital,
green, collectivist utopia[20], one overseen by an amalgam of supranational corporate and government
benevolence.

Whilst one can understand the eSafety Commissioner tackling her core missions (cyber bullying, explicit
online content aimed at minors etc)[21], Inman Grant has publicly stated that she regards “online
invective” as being akin to launching a ballistic missile laden with toxins[22], such is its threat. Of course,
hyperbole of this nature is utter nonsense, but it feeds the modern industry of confected online moral
panic, driven cynically by modern media for clicks, mostly seized upon by the politically motivated to
leverage attention for ideological and political points-scoring under the banner of Political Correctness[23].
This is typical of those who operate in these circles, who engage in a sort of hate-baiting to manipulate
public perception by labelling opinions or statements they disagree with as “harmful” or “hateful”, thus
ensuring dissenting voices are pressured to conform to a prevailing acceptable narrative[24].

According to Inman Grant, the public must be offered carefully curated _versions of events only and_
barred from expressing (or spared exposure to) “harmful” ideas and thoughts that don’t conform to a
particular version of reality. Rather than permit the free flow of news, opinion and information from a
variety of perspectives to stimulate lively public debate, those who desire to throttle the flow seemingly
believe that their viewpoints are the only ones that matter, that too much of the wrong sort of opinion
is harmful. But harmful to who exactly? And who defines “harmful”?

Should we blindly believe Inman Grant’s opinions about each, simply because of her title or her Davos
connections? Alternately, would it make more sense to be skeptical of her views, considering her former
ties to Microsoft and Twitter and her WEF affiliation? Of course, she is absolutely entitled to those views
_and to air them publicly as she sees fit; all opinions are valid. But therein lies the central issue – her very_
public views _should be open to scrutiny or challenge._ _That is the point of debate. Her views on the_
subject, or those of Michelle Rowland, are no more relevant than mine, yours or any other voter in this
country. Inman Grant perhaps has noble intentions but likely doesn’t realise that perhaps something is
amiss, that she may inadvertently be sowing the seeds of genuine division.

Would it be “harmful” to express this view online according to the legislation under consideration or
ACMA’s remit? Would I be guilty of “misinformation” if I suggest that there might be a _soupcon of_
nefarious intent behind a sovereign government enacting legislation promoted by the UN and conceived
by the WEF’s “Global Coalition for Digital Safety”, that might seek to criminalise online speech, restrict
debate or otherwise re-define fact or fiction according to its own self-interest?

I am referring to the fact that the United Nations published its “Our Common Agenda Policy Brief 8 _Information Integrity on Digital Platforms”[25] in June 2023 as part of its Agenda 2030 updates leading up_
to their “Summit of the Future” in 2024, in which it purports to uphold the concept of “Information
Integrity”, with its central thesis being that this is:

“[…] threatened by disinformation, misinformation and hate speech.”

The document defines misinformation as:

_“[…] the unintentional spread of inaccurate information shared in good faith by those_
_unaware that they are passing on falsehoods”,_

and further asserts that misinformation, along with disinformation and hate speech:

_“[…] pollute(s) the information ecosystem and threaten(s) human progress.”_

What an amazing coincidence.

_Brief 8 proceeds to argue for a multilateral governmental agreement to tackle the issue, to control digital_
content and ensure that online platforms don’t promote so-called misinformation, disinformation and
hate speech[26], to limit the online “harms” that these may cause. Lucky then that those who participate
in the drafting of UN policy documents such as this to police the world’s online content are those most
likely to benefit from said policing as governments like ours apparently operate in lockstep with them.

Sarcasm aside, who benefits? Unless us plebians are being kept in the dark about a series of sinister
global catastrophes unfolding that will disrupt the very fabric of the universe itself if the powers that be
don’t engage in online censorship, we all know the answer to that.

There are already too many special interest groups, corporations and individuals who both benefit from
and unduly influence government decisions, said influence often supplanting the will of the voting
public, or usurping the direction in which a country is taken politically or culturally. This is the
“unwarranted influence” mentioned in the famous speech by outgoing US president, Dwight D
Eisenhower, in 1961[27] when he warned about outside parties to the US government usurping unearned
authority over government decision-making. We are living this reality now, and it is not only fraught
with danger, but quite literally exists to further the interests of unaccountable, unelected, UN-aligned,
Davos-attending bodies and individuals at the expense of the Australian voting public. It was there for
all paying attention to see during the Covid pandemic, a vast coterie of pharma enablers and influence
peddlers, profiting from their ability to influence government legislation and shape public opinion.

The Australian government at various levels spent the years of the Covid pandemic spreading enough
genuine mis-and disinformation to last the beleaguered citizens of this country a lifetime, engaging in
industrial quantities of gaslighting and fearmongering in the process. There was an astonishing amount

25 https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/our-common-agenda-policy-briefinformation-integrity-en.pdf
26 It would be fine if so-called “hate speech” was an objective concept or adjudicated impartially. Too often
however “hate speech” at best reflects a misattribution of intent, or at worst a cynical attempt to launder media
attention because our modern culture elevates victims and offence-taking. Polarising, divisive media headlines
designed to inflame tensions between groups have become the order of the day.

of misleading and downright false information emitted by “authoritative” sources throughout, most
notably from public health authorities, health ministers, pharma executives and legacy media,
demonstrating a concerted effort to ensure that the public acted a certain way, and believed certain
facts as irrefutable. A huge amount of this took place online, via platforms such as Facebook, Twitter
and YouTube.

Anyone challenging so-called authoritative sources, whether presenting data and expertise from
reputable independent sources, pointing out scientific absurdities, blatant contradictions or logical
fallacies[28], arguing for caution, or those simply expressing concern at the knee-jerk authoritarian
excesses of the official Covid response – regardless of their intellectual or professional bona fides – was
met with derision and hostility, deemed “dangerous”, “selfish”, “irresponsible”, a “conspiracy theorist”.
And that’s _before they were censored on, or de-platformed from, Facebook or Twitter. One was_
apparently not allowed to question any aspect of the official Covid narrative _and remain a citizen in_
good standing.

And ACMA sits in the middle of this advocating for more of the same, declaring without a hint of irony
that:

“The online propagation of disinformation and misinformation presents an increasing
_threat to Australians … [that there is a] ‘infodemic’ of online disinformation and_
_misinformation, particularly in relation to the real-world impacts of COVID-19 […] [29]”_

in its June 2021 report to government, the progenitor of this proposed legislation. The 150-page report
lists no individual authors and presents as a monolithic treatise implying that anyone or anything that
dissents from a particular orthodoxy must either be conspiracy-based or the outcome of
misinformation. It repeatedly employs the old chestnut of conflating genuine sentiment, say the
informed or conscientious opposition to Covid lockdowns, with the idea that thoughts like these must
be the result of exposure to misinformation or conspiratorial thinking because “authoritative sources”
disagreed.

Given the pandemic had been announced 6-months prior, it is understandable that Covid was a central
facet of the report. It cites numerous academic and media Covid “experts” as categorical, irrefutable
evidence to stifle the murmurings of those nutty online Covid conspiracy theorist groups[30], the only
problem being that with the passing of time, we find that (through the occasional grudging admission
or tacet shifting of the goalposts) most of these expert citations from 2021 should be deemed
“disinformation” today.

One of the interesting paragraphs can be found on page 46, citing a survey study out of the UK that
declares Covid vaccine “hesitancy” to be higher among people using online search engines other than
Google, implying as early as January 2021 that people who exhibited Covid vaccine “hesitancy” were
more likely to believe in conspiracies. This is so emblematic of the mindset of the authors of the study
and the information environment created by the pandemic that continues to this day – frame the

scenario in which any and all dissent from an official narrative, regardless of how informed, is seen as
emblematic of conspiracy[31], and simply exclude any refutations from those who would challenge the
assertion. And then frame the conspiracy as dangerous. Job done.

_Thinking is dangerous. Don’t think for yourself. Google it._

Does ACMA truly believe its own report still holds water in August 2023? Does it stand by its position
statements regarding Covid-19 misinformation and disinformation circa June 2021 today? Is the
undermining of trust in “authoritative sources” as the June 2021 report suggests really the consequence
of online “misinformation”, or is it the consequence of those “authoritative sources” acting in bad faith,
being proven time and again to have been dishonest? How is “undermining official health advice” a realworld consequence of so-called misinformation when so much of that “official health advice” during the
Covid era has been shown to have been nothing more than a collectivist, one-size-fits-all orthodoxy in
which the vast differences in potential health outcomes between individuals, based on their underlying
health, medical history, age, fitness, lifestyle, diet, pre-existing comorbidities and general susceptibility
to a novel respiratory virus were simply ignored? The “official health advice” may have been official,
and it may have been advice, but it had nothing to do with health.

So as millions of Australians emerge blinking from their collective government-prescribed, media-driven
Covid stupor, the truth slowly emerges that the very “expert” class that implemented Australia’s
lockdowns-mandates-masking[32] response in lockstep with global orthodoxy, that suspended common
sense, ignored established pre-pandemic medical science and public health protocols[33], denied the
concepts of privacy, freedom and dignity, shuttered economies and small businesses, racked up trillions
of dollars in unnecessary government debt, broke global supply chains, and hampered the lives of so
many for so long, did so through a combination of incompetence, arrogance, self-interest and rigid
conformity to “authoritative” voices. The situation was only made possible through a coordinated
campaign of government-initiated, media-facilitated, “fact-checked” online censorship, but apparently
the public need not worry, because it was all done with best endeavours and for the greater good.

No thanks. No more.

While I have no great expectations of this process, I put it to those tasked with assessing the public’s
feedback to this proposed legislation that what we need in this country is less censorship and fewer
censors, fewer fact checkers[34], less blind adherence to narrative, and more open and honest dialogue
both online and in the legacy media about what decisions are in the best interest of all Australians. The
past few years have shown this to be necessary.

31 The survey in question of ~5,000 UK residents implicitly frames the questioning of official covid narrative as
conspiratorial, defining “mild” conspiracy thinking as those suggesting people should be “asking more
_questions”, and of course linking said conspiracy thinking to vaccine hesitancy._
32 https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/scottish-news/no-evidence-support-covid-lockdowns-30470038
Belated official reports are being released elsewhere noting there is no evidence that lockdowns (or facemasks
outside of clinical settings) were effective in improving Covid outcomes. A more honest telling would
acknowledge that there never was any authentic scientific basis to implement lockdowns (or facemasks outside
of clinical settings) in the first place.
33 Such as the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (AHMPPI) published in October 2019
(just months before the pandemic)

It doesn’t really matter whether those at ACMA who draft legislation of this nature do so with all the
best intentions in the world[35], whether they truly believe in the power of a benevolent state to protect
its citizens from what it deems as harmful, whether they truly believe in the idea that an expert
consensus must curate online information because the expert consensus is entirely beyond reproach or
that corporations that benefit from the consensus never seek unjust enrichment; it never ends that way.

There is no monopoly on consensus or the truth, as much as some would wish otherwise.

There’s a name for the system emerging here that gained popularity in pre-WW2 Italy, a marriage of
massive multi-national corporate interests and the State, and watching our erstwhile political leaders
set out to find ways to cede control of thought, word and deed to a select few appointed corporate
gatekeepers under the guise of “preventing harms” fills me with dread. Should we desire a future
wherein unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats dictate what we can or cannot say, think, read or write?

HL Mencken famously wrote[36] decades ago that:

“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence
_clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins”,_

meaning of course that governments habitually create, propagate and inflate problems and crises in
order to keep the populace obedient, confused, despondent and afraid. This is true currently of:

  - the Covid “crisis”,

  - climate alarmism in all its guises[37],

  - Russia!!! Russia!!! Russia!!!

  - the incessant ululation about “far right extremism” or the bogeyman of fascism lurking around
every corner,

  - the elevation of gender ideology into every facet of existence,

  - and every other -phobia and -ism going.

Every day the public is confronted with a cacophony of politically motivated, blatantly propagandistic
edicts, reports, media stories and opinion pieces about some imagined hobgoblin emerging out of one
or other of these alleged emergencies, all broadcast widely on social media and yet almost none of it is
ever particularly relevant, salient, immediate, threatening, or even remotely accurate. Very few of these
official reports are, or would ever be, deemed “misinformation” by their originators; at best any factual

35 We all know what the road to Hell is paved with.

37 Refutations of the climate alarmism racket are many and varied, from the hopelessly inaccurate
prognostications of doom to the manipulation of historical climate records and the reality that the underlying
data and science never matches the hysterical media headlines. These are typically drowned out by the sheer
volume of the megaphones afforded the prophets of doom and celebrity climate activists like Greta Thunberg
and Al Gore by The Guardian, BBC, and ABC et al. Anyone looking for a sane explanation of the central conceit
underpinning the climate-industrial complex and its many corporatized, unscientific, ideological, misanthropic,
nihilistic and cultish patterns of behaviour need look no further than the work by renowned British journalist,
Christopher Booker, in his book ‘Groupthink: A Study in Self Delusion” published posthumously in 2020.

irregularities or obvious lies and distortions are shortly thereafter forgotten by the public or retracted,
buried in the flood of new alarmist stories that invariably emerge in a subsequent 24-hour media cycle[38].

Whatever societal harms government fears will emerge from online “misinformation” cannot be worse
than the spurious and mendacious hobgoblins that the government and thinking classes propagate for
their own selfish interests, from which the public need always be “clamorous to be led to safety”. The
resulting damage from “misinformation” would be inconsequential when measured against the harms
that will follow if genuine dissent, disagreement, conscientious objection or other forms of online
thought and speech critical of the government or otherwise at odds with a particular consensus are
essentially criminalized because legislation arbitrarily deems them dangerous, inappropriate or harmful.

We lived through 3 years of the Covid pandemic witnessing what happens when a government and a
cabal of unelected “experts” determine that all manner of deprivation becomes necessary in order to
keep the public safe from harm “for the greater good”, when dissent is crushed and protest criminalised,
and no legislation should ever be contemplated again that would exacerbate those conditions,
notwithstanding the government’s empty assurances to the contrary.

38 According to multiple media studies, 6 out of 10 adults online look no further than the headline of a news
article, and of those who click it, most do not look past the opening paragraph.
