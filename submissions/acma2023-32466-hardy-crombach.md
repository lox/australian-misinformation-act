2023


To whom it may concern,
The introduction of so called misinformation and disinformation laws would be a huge mistake by the
Lobor government. A terrible step in the wrong direction in regard to authority and the abuse of power
in Australia.
Censorship of the sort proposed should be avoided. No one is being harmed by the sharing of
information.
Over recent years, I’ve noticed that in many instances, information from voices dissenting from the
mainstream and government narrative, have turned out to indeed be correct in their assertions that
what governments and media are purpouting as the truth contains lies, misrepresentations and
deceit. I need to allow myself to be exposed to all information, including that which some would
conveniently call misinformation or disinformation, so that I can be assured that I am sufficiently
informed, and make up my own mind. And I welcome the fact that other people might have a different
opinion to mine, and they are encouraged to voice it.
It has been proven time and time again that governments, bureaucracies, mainstream media, NGO’s
etc, have deliberately formed narratives to suit their own corrupted agendas;

  - Non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and a million dead Iraqis as a result.
  - Efficacy of pandemic medications; both new (vaccines) and existing (Ivermectin,

Hydroxychloroquine, Vitamin D).

  - Efficacy of pandemic lock-downs, social distancing and the wearing of surgical face masks as

scientifically proven effective measures of control.

  - Unexplained increase to the excess mortality rate that cannot be attributed to a Coronavirus.
  - Information that Julian Assange revealed, caused detriment to the safety of any government

operative or employee.

  - The need to send 368 billion dollars of our money for nuclear submarines to protect us from

our own largest trading partner, China.

  - The story that the most sued industry in the world, the pharmaceutical industry, should be the

largest funder of our medical oversight body (AHPRA).

  - Treaties and deals with foreign organisations to cede our sovereignty.
  - All of this land’s 300+ indigenous nations have not been individually consulted, and nor have

they unanimously consented, in regard to any proposed constitutional changes.

These are all issues for which I am grateful that people and organisations have been willing and able
to share alternative information and views so that I am able to be certain of my own informed
opinions.
If this freedom of choice is taken away from the public of Australia, it is likely that the bodies in
support of such a dystopian action will not be able to enjoy that same level of public confidence as in
years gone by.
Censorship has never been a suitable solution, or will it ever be a suitable answer to any issue or
topic that our nation may face now or into the future. Freedom must prevail.

Sincerely,

Hardy Crombach
