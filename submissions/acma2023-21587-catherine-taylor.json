    "Notable Quotes": [
      "I reject strongly that ACMA would even consider this censorship, to formulate a bill to present to Parliament disavowing our free speech rights as a human being.",
      "Choosing for me and others what we can hear or say or see on social media is an affront to our sovereignty to choose for myself and be responsible for my choices.",
