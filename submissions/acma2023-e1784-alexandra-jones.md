# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

**Submission to Minister Rowland and ACMA    from Alexandra Jones,** 7/08/2023

I strongly oppose this oppressive Bill that seeks to prevent Australians from publicly
ques�oning or commen�ng on the Government’s narra�ve in regard to a range of public
interest ma�ers. Due to this modus operandi by Government, too many Australians have
already been kept in the dark during the declared Covid-19 Pandemic. Too many Australians
in unprecedented numbers have suffered serious adverse reac�ons, including death,
following the Provisionally Approved experimental Covid-19 so-called vaccines. The most
recent example of **lack of transparency has been the TGA’s Full Registra�on granted,**
13/07/2023, to unsafe and ineffec�ve Covid-19 so-called vaccines.

According to the TGA website: **_The TGA is closely monitoring adverse event reports in_**
**_people aged under 18 years._**

**Rebekah Barnett, Dystopian Down Under reports:** Australia’s drug regulator, the
Therapeutic Goods Administration, has quietly granted full registration to the

Covid vaccine.

The implica�ons of passing this Bill pose a serious risk of on-going harm to the health and
mental well-being of Australians. We have endured over recent years unprecedented levels of
human rights abuses, of systemic censorship of highly creden�aled medical and well-being
experts, of community protests over falsely claimed Covid-19 so-called “safe vaccines” that
were known to cause serious injuries and even death. The **World Health Organiza�on’s**
declara�on of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the misleading One Health global vaccina�on model
implemented by the WHO’s Member States, including Australia, will scar our collec�ve psyche
for years to come. This Bill if passed will further oppress Australians and suppress important
medical and personal health and well-being informa�on. The Bill should be rejected by all
Members of Parliament.

  - The State and Territory Public Health Emergency Management measures implemented
during the declared Pandemic taught us that Poli�cians, Public Health Authori�es,
Bureaucrats, major Digital Pla�orm Providers and the Mainstream Media cannot be
trusted to be the arbiters of truth on ma�ers rela�ng to medical Misinforma�on and
Disinforma�on. **This Bill** **exempts and protects ACMA and these en��es who have**
knowingly or unknowingly misled Australians. These en��es were in fact the
“conspiracists” and spreaders of Medical and Public Health Misinforma�on and
Disinforma�on through systemic censorship of the truth.


-----

- These en��es were guilty of false claims that Covid-19 so-called vaccines would
provide “immunity”, were “safe” and “effec�ve in preven�ng transmission” of Covid19 to others. Informed Australians now know that none of this was true. Vaccine
manufacturers such as had not undertaken the necessary tes�ng to jus�fy the
widespread claims of “safety and efficacy”. Australia’s Regulator, the **Therapeu�c**
**Goods Administrator had not undertaken the necessary independent research to**
support popula�on-wide vaccina�on campaigns and workplace mandates. This Bill if
passed will result in more of the same outrageous mishandling of Public Health
ma�ers, causing on-going injury and death.

- **Furthermore, personal medical choices, bodily autonomy, informed consent to**
**medical interven�ons and freedom from medical coercion are fundamental human**
**rights that are also con�ngent upon access to trusted independent health advice.**
**Poli�cians, bureaucrats and digital pla�orm providers are unqualified arbiters of**
**medical Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on on ma�ers rela�ng to personal health**
**and well-being.**

- The Bill as well as the Senate Commi�ee View and Recommenda�ons **conflate**
**geopoli�cal issues with the on-going Public Health and Mental Health** **issues endured**
by millions of Australians due to the implementa�on of totalitarian Covid-19 Public
Health Emergency Management measures, including lockdowns and mask wearing.
Many thousands of Australians ques�oned and protested against these irra�onal
measures par�cularly because of their adverse effect on the health and mental health
of children. The official Government Public Health narra�ve led to cri�cal thinking
concerned Australian ci�zens, including doctors and nurses being treated with
contempt. **Many were labelled in Mainstream Media as “conspiracists and**
**an�vaxxers”.** Threatened with **deregistra�on by AHPRA, the Australian Health**
Prac��oner Regula�on Agency, many medical prac��oners were coerced and
censored from raising concerns about the vaccine rollout and mandates.

- The **systemic censorship of effec�ve treatments for Covid-19 such as**
Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermec�n, vitamins C, D and Zinc as well as the moun�ng
evidence of vaccine injuries and harm from **Remdesivir,** was an **unconscionable**
**suppression of the truth and a reported cause of unnecessary harm to pa�ents..**

- **Former Prime Minister, Sco� Morrison, misleadingly claimed that there were no**
vaccine mandates in the full knowledge that mandates were implemented in the
States and Territories, contrary to our Na�onal human rights obliga�ons as well as the
**Australian Immuniza�on Register Act 2015 and the** **Australian Immuniza�on**
**Handbook Guidelines.**

- **Former Health Minister, Greg Hunt, who had presented the 2014 AIR Bill claiming**

that it was consistent with Australia’s obliga�ons to Human Rights (preven�ng medical
coercion, mandates and uninformed consent to medical experimenta�on) publicly
stated that Australia would provide important data to the world on Covid-19
**(experimental) vaccines. It was clear from his statement that Australians were**
involved in post market monitoring of experimental novel mRNA drugs that were
falsely claimed to be “Safe and effec�ve”.

- **Former Western Australian Premier, Mark Mc Gowan, also claimed that Western**

**Australia was an experiment due to its high level of (experimental) popula�on-wide**
**vaccina�on.**
These conflic�ng and misleading statements by former leading Federal and State poli�cians
are a clear indica�on that our Governments, poli�cians, bureaucrats and a lax as well as
complicit Mainstream News Media should not be the arbiters of Medical Misinforma�on and
Disinforma�on, contrary to what the Bill would have us believe, as stated in:
**_excluded content for misinforma�on  (ref. excerpts below: a. b. c. and d.)_**

- **The ACMA Bill delivers unwarranted privileges to the elite arbiters of truth that have**

**already led our popula�on into a nightmare world of relentless pandemics and**
**associated vaccina�ons in line with the WHO vision of the future. The main**
**beneficiary, however, of this Bill if passed, would be the toxic global pharmaceu�cal**
**industry and its “puppeteers” who influence public health policy at the expense of**
**be�er Public Health outcomes that could promote natural immunity of the**
**popula�on with less reliance on toxic medica�ons and vaccines.**

- **The Bill ignores the** **harm to millions of Australians and the loss of trust in our**

bureaucrats and poli�cians who tacitly or complicity silenced ra�onal dissen�ng views
about Covid-19 and the unsafe and ineffec�ve, popula�on-wide experimental mRNA
injec�ons. The Bill fails to acknowledge Australia’s descent into totalitarianism when
it violated our right to respect for medical privacy and freedom from medical coercion
as stated in various interna�onal Human Rights covenants to which Australia is a
signatory. Also ignored was the stated respect for Human Rights in the WHO’s own
**Interna�onal Health Regula�ons to which Australia is a signatory.**

- The millions of doses of Provisionally Approved mRNA so-called “vaccines” that did

not provide immunity and were neither “safe” nor “effec�ve”, were purchased at huge
**cost to the Australian taxpayer. Li�le if anything is reported by mainstream media or**
the Greens Party as to the cost to our budget and to the natural environment burdened
with plas�c vials, PPE and toxic mRNA waste as the vials reach the expiry date and
demand falls for obvious reasons. The controversial approval of the harmful injec�ons
for children and teenagers, although not reported by mainstream media, appears to
have contributed to a further loss of trust in our public health authori�es, the TGA
and the Government’s narra�ve regarding Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on.

**Australia is: ”dumping Covid-19 vaccine requirements”, Poli�co.EU and the Na�onal**

**disposal: “Germany is on track to bin 200M Covid-19” cos�ng billions of Euros and at**

  - **Members of the European Parliament** **have acknowledged the Harm** **to the Health**
and Well-being of European popula�ons due to systemic censorship of the truth and
adherence to the conflicted World Health Organiza�on and its One Health Pandemic
policy to vaccinate global popula�ons. Representa�ves of the European Ci�zens’
Ini�a�ve openly raised their concerns in the European Parliament and launched the
**TRUST AND FREEDOM ini�a�ve to restore transparency, health and prosperity in their**
countries.

  - Transparency in Governance and freedom to openly debate important public health
ma�ers are fundamental to civil society. Australians do not need further censorship of
independent medical and public health informa�on by unqualified, uninformed or illinformed arbiters of medical Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on.

In conclusion, I reject this unnecessary and undemocra�c Bill that if passed will further violate
our fundamental human right to medical opinion, bodily autonomy and the freedom to
receive and exchange trusted health informa�on from independent sources, including online
digital pla�orms.

Recommenda�ons are copied below.

# Overall committee view and recommendation


8.1  In authoritarian states, citizens are subjected to government repression in
the form of censorship, where people are restricted from freely discussing issues
that would enable them to make fully informed social and political choices. Such
censorship is anathema to the values of democratic states such as Australia. This
provides authoritarian countries with an asymmetric advantage because they can
readily censor narratives within their own country while simultaneously exploiting
the openness of democratic societies to push their agendas offshore.

8.2 Because authoritarian governments cannot directly control the information
environment in democratic states via overt censorship, they seek to control the
information environment by flooding our online spaces with disinformation that
skews public debate, undermines trust in our democratic institutions,
establishes narratives that favour the interests of the perpetrating state and
make it difficult for the casual observer to separate truth from fiction.

8.3  We cannot allow this rising authoritarianism to contaminate our democracy
and undermine our social cohesion in the most challenging strategic
environment since the World War II.


8.4


The Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)
recently declared that Australia is facing an unprecedented challenge from
foreign interference and espionage, and that he is not convinced that we fully
appreciate the damage that it inflicts on our security, our democracy, our
economy and our social fabric.[[1]]
