**Subject: Public Consultation Submission - Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

10[th] July, 2023

To Whom It May Concern,

I write to you today as a concerned citizen regarding the proposed Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I am
submitting this letter as my official objection to this legislation, voicing my concerns rooted
in the principles of individual freedom of expression, democracy, and the preservation of a
free society.

Australia's strength lies in its commitment to democratic principles and the belief in the
inherent wisdom of its citizens. Freedom of expression forms a cornerstone of these
principles, fostering diversity of thought, encouraging open discourse, and enabling the free
exchange of ideas. This freedom, I believe, is under threat with the introduction of the
proposed bill.

While I fully acknowledge and appreciate the intention of combating online misinformation
and disinformation, I fear that the proposed powers granted to the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) may inadvertently infringe upon the right to
free speech. This could lead to an environment where individuals may feel hesitant to express
their views for fear of them being labelled as 'misinformation' or 'disinformation'. Such an
outcome would, I feel, be detrimental to the free and open nature of our society and our
democratic way of life.

By empowering a regulatory body to monitor, and potentially influence, the dissemination of
information online, we risk setting a precedent where the government becomes the arbiter of
truth. The population of a democratic society like Australia is perfectly capable of discerning
the validity of information, and this proposed legislation might unintentionally diminish that
individual discernment, creating overreliance on regulated truth.

The proposed legislation seems to assume a deficit in the ability of Australians to differentiate
between credible information and disinformation. However, I assert that individuals should
retain the right to engage, critique, and ultimately determine the value of information in the
digital landscape, as this is a crucial aspect of personal freedom and democratic participation.

I would encourage the consideration of alternative means to tackle the issue of online
misinformation and disinformation that do not impede upon individual freedoms, and rather
focus on educating citizens in media literacy. Encouraging a more informed and media-savvy
populace would, in my opinion, better serve the intended aim of this legislation.


-----

In conclusion, I urge you to consider these concerns and the potential implications for our
democratic society, and reconsider the provisions of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. In the fight against
misinformation and disinformation, let us not lose sight of the fundamental values that make
our society free and democratic.

Thank you for considering my views on this matter.

Yours sincerely,

W Crook
