     "Democracy is dead when a government legalizes propaganda known to be false
     (science) and silences all dissenting views."
     The big problem with this 'disinformation' legislative scheme is the 'Australian
     government' - a corporation subservient to the men and women of Australia - can
      now lie with impunity and anyone who speaks out what is TRUE, as it would
     inevitably be 'opposing' - is censored or worse, determined to be 'an enemy of
     the state'. Yes, if the false narrative of government steps out of bounds it is
     going to create 'enemies' - if that is what you now wish to call them -
     otherwise honest law abiding men and women of Australia speaking up to assert
     what is TRUE.
     ACMA is being tasked with becoming the Ministry of Progaganda. You are
      proposing to write totalitarianism into law. Edward Bernays would be very proud
     of you, or maybe you know that already? I'm not very impressed. Most people
     aren't actually, they just don't know how to go about telling you how they feel.
     If it is not abundantly clear to any of you, it is now to 79% of the people of
     Australia that the government out and out lied about Covid, safety of the jabs,
     lockdowns, masks, social distancing and more, knowing full well it had, and now
      no one trusts you as we see the blatent corruption. Yet you all hide this fact
      behind pretty soundbites and shill fact checkers (most 'fact checkers' are
     'captured' agencies or entities - meaning they are in no way impartial). Your
     Orwellian double speak about 'balancing disinformation with free speech' is
     laughable.
     Your proposed legislation needs to be amended to include the Following: "NO
     institution, corporation, corporate government agency - including the Australian
     government, parliament and all agencies and party(s) thereof, educational
     entity, entity and all agents thereof or otherwise is excepted, excluded,
     exempted or limited from liability for putting information forth, including
     disinformation or misinformation, that can be shown to cause harm or
     subsequently causes harm to any man, woman or person(s)."
      NOTE: Failure to do so renders your enactment unlawful and your legal basis null
      and void, thus inviting relentless legal battles aimed against ACMA and your
     corporate handlers.
