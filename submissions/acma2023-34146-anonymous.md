I strongly oppose the ACMA / Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill and
do not wish these amendments to the Communications Legislation to become law.

Debate is vital to a healthy democracy, and people should be encouraged to voice
their views and beliefs, and to be exposed to different and/or opposing beliefs and
opinions. This is how we develop intellectually, socially and ethically.

No government or government-appointed body should be the arbiter of truth. We can
clearly see how, over the last three years, our governments have themselves spread
mis- and disinformation. Some examples:

  - “Two weeks to flatten the curve” – that was false.

  - Professor Brendan Murphy said “Don’t wear masks – go about your normal

business” (The Sydney Morning Herald, 23/02/2020), but before long masks
were mandatory in almost all settings outside the home.

  - Vaccines are “safe and effective” – no vaccine is 100% safe, and covid vaccines

are no different. So unsafe are these vaccines that the federal government
introduced a specific Medicare Benefits Schedule item for cardiac MRI to help
diagnose myocarditis following mRNA vaccination.

  - The changing timelines between first and second doses – initially six months,

this shrank to mere weeks.

  - The change in advice about how many doses of a covid vaccine were required.

  - Our governments told us told time and time again that Covid-19 vaccination

would prevent illness and transmission – but it was abundantly clear even
before our vaccine roll out began that this was not true. The case numbers
following high vaccination rates in Australia would have been impossible if the
vaccines were truly effective.
```
    o Either our state and federal governments lied to us about the safety and

```
efficacy of the vaccines, or they didn’t know. Either of these is reason
enough to not suppress free speech, as this bill would do.

  - There are many more examples of information that has come from sources we

are supposed to trust, which have then proved to be wrong or harmful; these
examples include thalidomide, the ‘benefits’ of smoking, and whether eggs are
good or bad for you.

_The Australian revealed on 21 July, 2023, “Many censored social media posts did not_
contain Covid-19 misinformation”. Posts which were censored by the Australian
Government during the pandemic contained “factual information and reasonable
arguments”. No Government - or designated body - should have the right to prevent
ordinary people from sharing information or discussing ideas and beliefs. Silencing
dissenting opinions, squashing public debate, and preventing access to the
marketplace of ideas is what dictatorial governments do, and this country and its
people have literally gone to war to fight against those dictators. We do not want to
become that which we have already defeated.

Amendment 7 (2) (e) of the proposed bill states that the person “disseminating, or
causing the dissemination of, the content intends” to deceive others. Does this mean


-----

that the Federal Government and/or ACMA will not only decide what “truth” is, they will
also determine what an individual’s intention is in posting information? Will ACMA be
made up of mind readers? It is impossible for anyone else to truly know what an
individual’s purpose or intention is, and this amendment is frightening in its ability to
impose intent onto a person’s actions.

It is extraordinary that this draft bill defines “harm” as “harm”. Combined with 7 (3) (a)
“the circumstances in which the content is disseminated”, (e) “the author of the
information”, (f) “the purpose of the dissemination”, and (i) “any other relevant matter”,
it provides ACMA with terrifying power to suppress voices who disagree with the official
government narrative and to punish those who speak out.

Censoring debate and punishing dissent has and will result in harm – to the health and
wellbeing of all Australians, and to our democracy.

Finally, this draft bill breaches Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, which says: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and **to**
**seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and**
regardless of frontiers.”
