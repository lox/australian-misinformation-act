# The Key Flaw


## The concept of Misinformation (and its subset, as defined, of deliberate

 Disinformation), is meaningless without reference to the concept of Truth.

 This entire legislative proposal is based is the flawed notion that establishing the

 Truth is essentially unproblematic - and that as a consequence it’s possible and

 desirable for government to play a paternal role in determining what is, and is not,

 misinformation on the community’s behalf, .

 Yet the notion that it’s easy to determine the truth - and thereby reliably identify

 misinformation - flies in the face of thousands of years of philosophical inquiry and

 dispute. It overlooks the obvious fact that notions of what’s true and what’s not

 change dramatically over time and remain in flux.

 That’s not to say the concept of truth is without meaning - or that seeking the

 truth is pointless. Seeking the truth, in fact, is the purpose of any authentic

 intellectual inquiry. But truth is better seen as a goal rather than a fixed destination.

 Crucially, anything which hampers the process of truth seeking is unhelpful and

 potentially dangerous.

 That is my central objection to the legislation. It purports to assist the

 community by combatting “misinformation”, but would instead distort and

 undermine open, free debate - the best process we know for ascertaining the

 truth and identifying falsehoods.


# The case of COVID


## To anyone who survived the COVID pandemic in Australia and followed

 developments with a critical eye, it is downright astonishing that the Government

 has the chutzpah to propose legislation to control “misinformation” at this time.

 What’s obviously needed with regard to COVID is a thorough independent

 inquiry into pandemic management. This must include an attempt to review official

 policies that were implemented in the light of what we now understand about the

## disease. Necessarily such an enquiry must look at public advice given by

 governments and medical authorities - advice that was uncritically repeated by

 mass media and given pride of place in social media.

 In the initial months of 2020, most commentary about the possibility of a vaccine

 to protect against COVID focused on the difficulties and stressed the likelihood it

 would be years in development.

 Then a few major pharmaceutical companies swung into action at “warp speed”

 and soon the official information changed. From a speculative medium- to long
 term possibility, the COVID vaccines promoted in Western countries swiftly

 became promoted as THE way out of the pandemic.

 The authorities in the USA - and their mini-me equivalents in Australia - assured

 everyone that the vaccines would prevent infection and stop transmission. On that

 basis it was claimed that not taking the vaccine was extremely antisocial behaviour.

 When it became apparent that simply wasn’t true, the rationale for being

 vaccinated changed; it was no longer about preventing infection and transmission,

 but rather about reducing the severity of disease (at least short-term). But whereas

 the initial vaccination program was a two dose regimen, boosters soon came on the

 scene. People who faithfully follow government advice to take all the boosters

 available have by now endured at least five jabs.

 None of this would be so serious were it not for the increasingly obvious fact

 that adverse reactions to the vaccine have been far, far higher than initially

 promised, This is indicated by many data points including excess all-cause deaths,

 which have been abnormally high in Australia since 2022 and continue to be

 significantly above average.

 In addition, while the authorities’ fixation has been on lockdowns, masks and

 vaccination, almost no attempt was made to give early treatment to people infected

 with the novel coronavirus. In fact, it was discouraged. Despite promising

 indications that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin had benefits especially in the

 early stages of infection, those treatments were actively ridiculed.


-----

## The entire process amounted to unseemly group-think on an international level,

 promulgated mainly from the USA and UK, via government and media channels.

 High level expertise within Australia that could help steer better policy was

 ignored and suppressed if it clashed with the dominant paradigm. That paradigm,

 adopted so trustingly by Australian government authorise and regulators, was

 largely US in origin, and influenced by the vagaries, disfunction and blatant

 corruption of the USA’s medical establishment and regulatory processes.

 As time goes by, it’s become ever more clear that the sceptics of Australia’s

 official COVID policy were correct in many off their claims and criticisms. Thanks

 to the welcome change of management at Twitter, many of us are now able to share

 opinions and information again on that platform - but from 2021 there was a

 massive purge on social media of accounts that questioned the official narrative.

 This purge was partly Big tech and Big Media groupthink, but it was also

 carried out as a result of a government pressure. There has been no apology for this,

 or acknowledgement from government or mainstream media (with the welcome

 exception of x.com) that the censorship exercised at the time was inappropriate.

 Far from seeking to expand its powers to censor, the government in Australia

 should be facing public scrutiny over the disinformation it promulgated itself since

 2020, disinformation that was protected by censoring dissident views on mass

 media.

# The (Deliberate) Chilling Effect


## I appreciate the legislation does not propose that government takes a direct role

 in censoring specific posts on social media.

 While intolerable, that would at least be obvious. People would know what has

 been banned - and would be able to complain about specific decisions to quash free

 speech.


-----

## The proposal is for a more subtle process of encouraging and facilitating

 censorship, in cahoots with the tech companies that run social media, but with

 some very nasty added elements.

 Particularly creepy is the idea of creating lists of account holders with dissident

 opinions. The East German Stasi held similar lists, and that did now end well for

 the perpetrators.


# Conclusion


## A healthy democracy should encourage lively debate among its citizenry. Its

 decision-making should make full use of the expertise and talent in the community.

 It should never seek to intimidate, marginalise or de-platform dissidents whose

 only “offence” is to peacefully promote alternative opinions.

 The proposed legislation is unnecessary as the alleged harms of the current

 situation are unproven and unquantified. On the other hand, the potential harms of

 more - not less - censorship are real and highly significant.

 At a time when Australia’s political elite is ramming through a major long-term

 commitment to military alliance with the world’s most bombastic imperialists, with

 minimal public debate - and committing Australia to expenditures on military

 hardware on a scale unprecedented in our history - it is sinister that this

 government is proposing to monitor dissent with a view to its suppression.

 The problems of censorship have been well understood for a very long time.

 From Socrates to John Stuart Mill, from the US First Amendment to the Universal

 Declaration of Human Rights, there have been persistent and heroic attempts to

 make a persuasive case for free speech and open debate - and give this basic

 freedom legal force.

 Unfortunately Australia has no constitutional guarantee for free speech and the

 Human Rights Commission, from its inception, has been a disappointment to those

 of us who hoped it would strengthen the defence of free speech in Australia.

## The Government should withdraw this divisive legislation and focus instead

 on restoring the credibility of official information by taking a lot more care to

 ensure it is accurate, appropriate and truthful to the greatest extent possible - and

 not distorted by external pressure and corporate interests.
