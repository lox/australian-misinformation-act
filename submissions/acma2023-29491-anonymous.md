# Submission to the ‘new acma powers to combat misinformation and disinformation’

I am a concerned Australian resident having moved to this country some 34 years ago to raise my
family within this free and democratic society.

I love this country and am fundamentally concerned for our human rights.

This bill breeches the human rights of freedom of speech and expression of all Australians.

Not having written a submission before I find myself compelled to speak up for fear of such a bill
becoming law.

We need the primary means of information sharing in our current society to remain relatively
censorship free and indeed an open marketplace of ideas so that we don’t fall into corrupt
hegemonic ideologies that cannot be shifted or that can only be governed and controlled by the
authorities – the ruling class or government.

As a country we care about freedom of speech and expression. As per the International Covenant of
Civil and Political rights, article 19, says that not only does everybody have the right to hold free
opinions but everybody has the right to freely express those opinons through any media that they
choose.

Within this bill I notice that there is no definition for information that is misleading or deceptive. I
assume because it would be impossible to define.

In science there is no such thing as truth, only the best currently available theory based on the best
currently available evidence and or data. All of which is subject to regular change which inevitably
occurs. The last 3 years has been a good example of that. We all saw allegedly reputable sources
providing information that was allegedly true, safe and sound and that information subsequently
found to be false and baseless. An obvious example of this would be the world health organisation
who changed their recommendations throughout the C19 pandemic multiple times on the basis that
they had been wrong.

It is clearly going to create scope for manipulation and control for authoritarian censorship, signally
the end of freely sharing ideas online.

To go further in charging individuals’ astronomical penalties for doing so is outrageous and
unconstitutional.

This bill should not be passed being a huge overreach of power.
