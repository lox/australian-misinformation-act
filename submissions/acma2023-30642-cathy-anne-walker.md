Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill
fundamentally undermines the freedom of speech that is integral to our democracy.

One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is the creation of two distinct classes of
citizens. While politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions are
given the power to spread information, regardless of its accuracy, regular citizens are
subjected to stricter regulations. It is unjust to assume that certain individuals or
groups have more knowledge or authority over certain topics than others, especially
when it comes to industry insiders.

The internet has been a powerful tool for democratizing information and giving a
voice to regular citizens. However, this bill poses a significant risk to the expression
of these regular people by imposing excessive fines and restrictive speech
regulations on digital services. The industry-wide code proposed by this bill lacks any
"pressure escape valves" to alleviate potential harm. Such a one-size-fits-all approach
disproportionately affects the ability of regular citizens to freely express their
opinions and engage in democratic discourse.

Furthermore, the task of accurately discerning truth from falsehood is incredibly
challenging, if not impossible. History has shown us numerous instances in which
facts once considered true were later found to be false. This uncertainty is especially
prevalent in areas such as public health, where initial understandings often evolve
based on new discoveries and scientific advancements. By defining certain
information as public health-harming misinformation, this bill risks stifling crucial
debates and silencing dissenting voices.

Additionally, the bill's inclusion of information deemed "misleading" or "deceptive"
further erodes freedom of speech. Open and honest discussions require the freedom
to be wrong and the opportunity to debate the truth until a common ground is
reached. It is essential to recognize that claims of truth should be subject to scrutiny
and debate, rather than being categorically removed.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, the former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has
expressed serious reservations about the scope and application of this bill. His
statement on Twitter highlights the concerns surrounding the implementation of
such legislation and the potential for fines to be levied on information that turns out
to be true. If an expert with his credentials questions the bill's efficacy, it raises
serious doubts about its overall impact.

The influence of industry bodies, often driven by the largest players in the sector, is
another alarming aspect of this bill. Such bodies are likely to create industry codes
that function as anti-competitive wedges, enabling larger digital services to gatekeep
their industry against new competitors. This monopolistic approach undermines the
principles of free-market competition, which has shown evidence of effectively
addressing misinformation and disinformation issues through user migration to
platforms that meet community expectations.

Moreover, this bill relies heavily on current dominant digital platforms and risks
wiping out smaller competitors that find it challenging to comply with the onerous
regulatory requirements imposed by industry bodies. This contradicts the efforts of
competition regulators worldwide to reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.
The proposed bill jeopardizes the competition between platforms and fails to
consider the interests of consumers and smaller entities aiming to enter the field.

Rather than protecting minority groups, this bill may inadvertently persecute them.
Often, progress and social change are achieved by challenging previously accepted
truths and beliefs. By mandating a single code applied to every digital platform, this
bill eliminates any shelter for minorities when their views clash with the system's
prevailing narrative. This risks quashing alternative perspectives, hindering progress,
and endangering the principles of open and inclusive dialogue.

The delegation of legislative power to private entities under this bill also raises
constitutional concerns. The proposed arrangement allows companies to create
misinformation codes that become law, bypassing parliamentary approval. This
delegation of legislative power to non-government entities undermines the
principles of responsible governance and constitutional authority.

Furthermore, the broad definition of "harm" in the bill incorporates contested
matters of public policy, including health, the environment, and the economy.


-----

Suppressing legitimate discussions on these topics would unreasonably curtail the
implied constitutional freedom of political communication, as guaranteed by Article
19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The assumption made by the bill that government-approved institutions hold a
monopoly on truth is deeply problematic. It disregards the experiences and
viewpoints of ordinary Australians and limits diversity in viewpoints, which is crucial
in the process of sense-making and comprehensive decision-making.

The bill not only disempowers ordinary citizens but also poses threats and burdens
to digital platform providers and independent media organizations. The imposition
of negative records, reputational damage, financial penalties, and undue interference
infringements create an environment of fear and adversity. This style of governance,
reminiscent of totalitarian regimes, stands in stark contrast to Australian values, such
as mateship and freedom of thought and expression.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This bill infringes upon
the freedom of speech of Australian citizens, divides society into classes, stifles open
and honest discussions, favors monopolistic practices, and undermines the
constitutional principles of political communication. I urge you to reconsider the
damaging provisions of this bill and protect the fundamental democratic rights of all
Australians.

Thank you for considering my views. I trust that you will act in the best interest of our
democracy and safeguard the freedom of speech we hold dear.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
