Rarely is it justifiable for the government to enact legislation that expands its authority. This
bill not only diminishes freedom of speech but also presents a worrisome insinuation beyond
its immediate consequences, warranting careful consideration.

The proposed bill grants the government power to censor media content arbitrarily and lacks
clear definitions for its limitations. This ambiguity enables the government to pressure
companies into self-censorship based on vaguely defined terms, rather than factual
considerations. Consequently, the government evades direct responsibility for censorship
while imposing uncertain financial penalties on companies.

Furthermore, the bill seems to protect both the government and major media companies from
'misinformation,' a term left open to government interpretation. Such a move dangerously
contradicts the rights upheld by Common Law and international agreements.

A prime example is Facebook's compliance with government pressure to 'fact-check' posts
through a government-funded institution, indicating a disturbing level of control over
information. This bill not only encourages self-censorship but also manipulates the means
and parameters, even profit, of censorship. This unchecked authority jeopardises Australians'
free speech rights.

Additionally, instances where the government coerces third parties into self-censorship to
align with desired narratives as opposed to freely express inconvenient facts underscore the
bill's oppressive potential. The impact of such legislation has unconscionable potential.

The bill's secondary effect forces media companies to comply or risk survival, as the
government's role in the advertising market heavily influences their decisions, and the
constant threat of uncertain and undue financial penalty influences internal company
decisions. This leads to an undesirable environment where censorship thrives, driven by
ambiguous laws and market pressures.

By passing this bill, Australia risks undermining its commitment to legal precedents,
international covenants, and its citizens' fundamental rights to free expression. Supporting
this bill disregards these values and threatens Australia's democratic foundation.

It is crucial to recognise that the Labor party need not endorse let alone propose this bill, as it
is in stark opposition to Australiaâ€™s democratic interest and was certainly never part of their
own election platform. A thoughtful and ethical evaluation of the bill reveals its overreach
and breaches of established moral standards.

In conclusion, the proposed bill's implications extend far beyond its immediate scope, posing
a grave threat to free speech, ethical standards, and democratic principles. It is imperative to
reject this bill to preserve Australia's commitment to legal precedent and international
agreements, while upholding the rights of its citizens.
