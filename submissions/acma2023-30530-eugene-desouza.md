I believe this bill curtails every Australians right to freedom of speech for the following reasons and
should be withdrawn:

1. The Bill is a significant overreach by the government.

2. The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under international
human rights instruments like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights.

3. The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the public
square without transparency or accountability.

4. The Bill includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which risks it being weaponised to shut
down legitimate speech on pressing social issues.

5The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable for excessive and
onerous policing of legitimate speech.
