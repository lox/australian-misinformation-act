**Submission: New ACMA Powers to Combat Misinformation and Disinformation - Confidential**

To the Committee Secretary

To introduce myself, I am David Robert Wenk. I reside in and have

lived and worked in this area since 1991. I am employed as a Work Health & Safety Advisor. This has
been my main vocation for the thirty plus years I have worked in construction, mineral processing,
logistics and service industries in the region. During that time, I have worked for a number of major
employers such as Bechtel, Rio Tinto, Gladstone Ports Corporation, Downer Engineering, UGL and
Cement Australia.

Over the last three and a half years I have closely observed/scrutinized both government and medical
recommendations as they pertain to the COVID “Pandemic.” For many years I have had a deep interest
in personal health as it pertains to healthy eating, use of supplements and healthy lifestyle. Early in the
“pandemic” I was alerted to the fact that the recommended protocols were ineffective and even
dangerous. The use of ventilators and drugs like Remdesivir are examples of those protocols. Early
treatment was suppressed. Doctors were threatened if they attempted to prescribe off label medicines
and early treatments. A small number of medical professionals spoke out against the mandates and the
government sponsored health protocols. This group were labelled the “disinformation dozen.” I must
point out that several brave Australian medical practitioners also spoke out. Sadly, some that I know
have found themselves marginalized and their careers in tatters.

Fortunately, I followed the advice of these types of breakaway professionals who were treated much
like Galileo when he was confronted by the church over his views regarding the earth’s orbit.

I now find that I have waded through this crisis with my health intact but my view of big government,
corporations and the medical profession completely upturned.

I now note on a daily basis that the so called “safe and effective” and “recommended” government
pushed & sponsored health protocols are having a tragic effect on those who subscribed to this
narrative.

There are innumerable studies coming to light that show a great many diseases are being spawned by
the so called “vaccines”. The disease highlighted this week is only one of the deadly side effects of the
COVID “vaccines”.

I feel compelled to judge any future actions and powers that our government may bestow upon itself
with the recent failures and coverups of the past.

As a work health and safety professional I found myself confronted with health issues from colleagues
who informed me that they were suffering from “vaccine” related injuries. This they explained was also
confirmed by their health professionals.

It is for this reason I wrote as a 25-year WH&S professional to both Safe Work Australia as well as their
Queensland counterpart WorkSafe Qld. I advised the regulatory bodies that in my opinion they are
required to investigate COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions/injuries as they relate to the Australian
workforce due to the fact that these protocols were both mandated and promoted by businesses.
Incident notification fact sheet (safeworkaustralia.gov.au). Noting that is a serious offence not to report
any event/incident where a worker has suffered a serious injury/health issue. The adverse reactions
which are now documented for all to see pose a real risk to the work force going forward.

These regulatory bodies decided not to investigate my reports and concerns other than supplying me
with a legalistic reply which left me totally disgusted with their lack of independent enquiry.

It must be remembered that throughout this “pandemic” the rarest commodity has been the truth. We
are still witnessing (July 2023) so called experts argue over the origins of COVID-19. Some of Australia’s
leading medical/pharmacology experts have written reports such as the Altman report which highlight
key issues with the handling of the “pandemic” and highlight the dangers involved in rolling out
experimental medical treatments. Leading medical professors from the University of Queensland (e.g.,

) have been outspoken about the dangerous health protocols forced on to the

public by Government and Corporate sponsors. It has been brought to light long before the “pandemic”
that lobbyists from the major pharmaceutical companies are able to apply pressure to both of our major
parties by handing out large donations. Many of these donations I have read are undisclosed.

The Australian government (State and Commonwealth) has proven that they have an agenda to grab
power and fall under the influence of corporations and pressure groups who do not have the interests of
the public at heart.

If you look at the above diagram and imagine that each of the layers of Swiss cheese represent

consecutive layers of protection for the Australian citizen and imagine as new laws and emergency

powers are implemented the harm from these powers gets closer and closer to that citizen.

These layers have been eroded by Government overreach which started many years in the past but is

accelerating at “Warp” speed in our current era.

It is for this reason I strongly reject this Bill and so much more that our law makers are contriving.

Yours sincerely

David Wenk
