I am writing to oppose the Communications Legislation Proposed Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The legislation would grant the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)
unprecedented unilateral control over the dissemination of information online; with civil
and criminal penalties for dissenters. Of course, the government itself and the media are
proposed to be exempt. As will be demonstrated below, it is the government and media
who are the main spreaders of misinformation and disinformation.

This is one of the most Orwellian Bills I have ever seen a government propose in my long
lifetime. The Bill is dangerous and an inappropriate abrogation of a fundamental human
rights.

I will never vote Labor again if this proposed legislation is passed.

I might remind those pushing this bill that our human rights as people are given by God, not
by government. These rights include:

   - Freedom of speech and expression

   - Freedom of association

   - Bodily freedom

   - Freedom of religion

   - Freedom of movement

All these God given freedoms were trampled on by the government during the so-called
pandemic.

While our constitution does not provide freedom of speech rights for individuals in
Australia, the High Court has inferred a freedom of political communication from sections 7
and 24 of the Constitution.

The UK Bill of Rights 1688 is part of Australian law and provides that "the Freedom of
Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned
in any Court or Place out of Parliament".

These rights should be extended to all Australians. This bill proposes the opposite.

Notwithstanding, it was the Department of Health who attempted to censor and deplatform an elected member of parliament (Craig Kelly) (including Parliamentary debates) to
silence criticism of government policy. Subsequently, Mr Kelly’s comments were proven

valid and if adopted, might have saved thousands of lives due to preventative treatment.
How many other Australians were also subjected to cancellation by the government
departments?

And remember New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern once said, "We will continue to
be your single source of truth," and that, "Unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth."
Anyone who makes such a claim is clearly a psychopath.

I therefore strongly oppose the Australian Government trying to Statutorily Enshrine a
Ministry of Truth.

I would like to remind this committee that it was the government through its Ministers and
departments, that was the super spreader of misinformation/disinformation during the socalled pandemic.

Here are some examples of the government spreading disinformation and misinformation:

The public were told many things by the science denying health bureaucrats and their
puppet politicians during this time that have been shown to be completely wrong. It
appears that many of the messages from government were designed to create fear and
were not public health messages. Many were just plain lies.

Here are but a few examples:

It’s very clear from the data and the research that the Covid vaccines do not prevent
transmission as we were told by the health bureaucrats:

https://www.stardem.com/news/national/cdc-covid-vaccines-won-t-stop-transmissionfully-vaccinated-can-still-get-spread-delta-strain/article_5f83d0cb-8b0a-535d-bbad3f571754e5ae.html

https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/human-body/yes-they-claimed-thevaccines-would-prevent-transmission/news-story/a176eb002c29e603fc29ef9fe0b33b18

The pharmaceutical companies never researched transmission and did not make the claim.
It was made up by the health bureaucrats! That is the health bureaucrats lied to the
Australian public.

It’s very clear from the data and the research that the Covid vaccines do not prevent illness
as we were told by the health bureaucrats. In fact, as now some longitudinal data and
research demonstrates, the more injection one has, the more likely a person is to keep
catching the virus and the more severe the symptoms:

https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/10/6/ofad209/7131292?login=false

‘The risk of COVID-19 also increased with time since the most recent prior COVID-19 episode
and with the number of vaccine doses previously received’.

Peak bodies around the globe are now acknowledging the so-called vaccines caused injury.
The risk of myocarditis is higher after Covid infection than Pfizer or Moderna vaccination
across all gender and age groups studied, according to the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html

It’s clear, we were lied to that the contents of the Covid vaccines stay in the muscle of the
arm as autopsies are finding the vaccine contents in all our organs:

Researchers knew that the so-called vaccine DOES NOT stay in the arm muscle but
distributes throughout the body within 6 hours of the injection.

It’s clear the TGA knew the Covid vaccines would harm the unborn, even before the
injections were rolled out. This is the most egregious lie told by the health bureaucrats that
is directly related to the killing of the unborn (see graph below):

https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR591421

The below report is particularly disturbing given it was received by the TGA in January, 2021
BEFORE the so-called vaccine rollout and demonstrated the vaccines would harm the
unborn.

It’s clear, the wearing of masks were worse than useless and even counterproductive
causing possible short and long term health issues:

47 Studies (CDC & PubMed) confirm ineffectiveness of masks for COVID and 32 more studies
confirm their negative health effects: https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/47-studiesconfirm-inefectiveness-of-masks-for-covid-and-32-more-confirm-their-negative-healtheffects/

This study below and the recent Cochrane Review only confirmed what research has shown
for 40 years. Face masks make NO difference.

What is not demonstrated by this research but by many other studies is the damage done
by prolonged wearing of face masks:

  - 40% less oxygen leading to possible brain damage, especially in children

  - Bacterial infection

  - Intake of micro-plastics into lungs and cells

  - Downstream Physio-metabolic dysfunctions

Masks in hospitals 'made no difference to Covid infection rates'.
Researchers from St George's Hospital in London analysed routinely collected
infection control data over a 40-week period between December 4, 2021 and
September 10, 2022.

The above was all obvious taking into account the size of the various particles involved.

It is clear lockdowns were counterproductive, dangerous and harmful to not just the
economy but to individuals:

Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Lund University examined almost 20,000
studies on measures taken to protect populations against Covid across the world.

New study on the impact of lockdowns is published in a report by the Institute of Economic
Affairs.

The study’s authors conclude: “The science of lockdowns is clear; the data are in: the deaths
saved were a drop in the bucket compared to the staggering collateral costs imposed.”

The report authors said their findings showed that the draconian measures had a “negligible
impact” on Covid mortality and were a “policy failure of gigantic proportions”.

This study is the first all-encompassing evaluation of the research on the effectiveness of
mandatory restrictions on mortality,” according to one of the study’s co-authors, Dr. Lars
Jonung, professor emeritus at the Knut Wicksell Centre for Financial Studies at Sweden’s
Lund University, “It demonstrates that lockdowns were a failed promise. They had negligible
health effects but disastrous economic, social and political costs to society. Most likely
lockdowns represent the biggest policy mistake in modern times.”

A collection of other published research on the failures of lockdowns:

https://thefatemperor.com/scientific-analyses-and-papers-on-lockdown-effectiveness/

It is clear that Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine were effective as a early preventative
treatment for covid but the government banned these treatment protocols to allow the socalled vaccines to be given ‘provisional approval’. Many people died because they did not
receive treatment:

Excess deaths and miscarriages:

These graphs, that use ABS data, demonstrate all that needs to be said. Notice the
miscarriages started exactly 9 months after the so-called vaccine rollout in February, 2021.

There are many other issues too exhaustive to be included here that require independent
investigation. We don’t want a Ministry of Truth, run by the same people who lied to us
constantly during the so-called pandemic. We need a Royal Commission as promised by
Albanese into these lies and accountability to all those involved.

It’s now time to reflect on all these issues, have the issues investigating by independent
people who are not owned by the pharmaceutical companies and to bring justice to those
who have misled the public to ensure this malfeasance does not happen again.

I urge you to reject this proposed Bill.

Regards

Dr Peter Miller
