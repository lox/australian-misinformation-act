# To the Secretary The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES/THE SENATE

 Congratula�ons

As a citizen of Australia and a resident of the state of Queensland I wish to express my gratitude to the Albanese
Government for their initiative in putting together a bill that seeks to stamp out misinformation and
disinformation. It is evident that the bill makes a very strong stand in favour of the ‘truth’ and seeks to quell the
potential harm associated with misinformation and disinformation. Yet I have a few concerns which I also wish to
express in this submission.

# The positive action of this bill

As I read the bill combatting misinformation and disinformation, it was abundantly clear that the bill will achieve
the end result that the government intends it to achieve, namely silence all ‘misinformation and disinformation’.
All who attempt to disseminate misleading information will be swiftly shut down. Social media platforms are
frequently used for the purpose of publicising false information by people whose aim is to deceive others, usually
for their own gain, so this bill will put an end to such deception from unscrupulous individuals. I am convinced
that no social media organisation would be willing to risk being fined by ACMA by allowing false information to
be posted on their platforms. Perhaps, another benefit is that those individuals who plan to deceive others, may be
so swiftly dealt with that they will be stopped from posting their lies and deceptive articles on the social media
outlets.

It is clear that the Government of Australia recognises the need to protect the rights and safety of various groups
in Australia. The bill seeks to protect groups in Australian society by preventing speech that incites hatred against
any group on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or
mental disability. I believe that the vast majority of Australians would applaud this very affirming sentiment.

It is also clear that the Australian Government is seeking to ensure that misinformation and disinformation does
not disrupt the proper and heathy functioning of our society, or of the normal democratic processes in Australia.
They also see the need to protect the health of the Australian citizens ensuring that no harm comes to the finances
of individuals or the Australian economy.

The one area that I failed to see the significance of this bill is the area where the environment is concerned. But
perhaps I need to think a little more on this issue and how a person airing their views could harm the
environment.

# Some thoughts I have that I would appreciate being considered by you regarding the bill

Having expressed what I see as some of the positives regarding this bill, I feel that I need to express the thoughts I
have in the implementation and execution of this bill, and the effects and impacts I see it almost certainly will
have on social media platforms and on individuals who wish post their thoughts on such media.

As a citizen of Australia and a resident of the state of Queensland I wish to express some matters of concern that I
have regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation
Bill 2023, which I have read and find quite disturbing. Perhaps it is that this bill is not fully understood by me, or
that the explanations and definitions given in the bill have a different meaning to how it is plainly read by me, but
a number of matters stand out with alarm bells ringing and red flags waving, warning me of potential danger if
this bill is accepted as it is and is implemented as it is proposed.

My biggest concern is that this bill only covers social media outlets and other digital platform services where the
information is disseminated socially and people can respond, copy and further disseminate the content. These
media sharing services will face the ire of the ACMA if they permit misleading information to be aired on their
platforms. At the same time the Government is exempt from the same conditions. Further concerns include the
fact that news outlets and the education system is also excluded from these rules that will be forced onto all other
media platforms.

It concerns me that ‘professional news content’ is not required to be true and accurate. Also, **the government**
**are excluding themselves from any requirement to produce and publicise accurate and true information.**


-----

our education system, whether that content is true and accurate or not.

**Governments at all levels can produce false information and publicise this misinformation without any fear**
**of any authority taking any action against them. Yet if anyone not covered by the exemptions (under**
**_Definitions, subclause Excluded content for misinformation purposes, and Excluded services for_**
**_misinformation purposes), publishes information that ACMA consider to be ‘mis/disinformation’(even if it is_**
later proven to be true information), those people/groups/media outlets/social media/etc., are subject to the full
force of the powers of ACMA, including heavy fines. We live in a society where the same rule is meant to apply
equally to all, yet, by this bill, the government will exclude themselves from any consequences of their own
misinformation.

Then the ques�on arises for me, “Who determines what is truth and what is dis/misinforma�on?” Does the
government have the right to determine what is true and what is misinforma�on? Does ACMA determine what
is mis/disinforma�on? Do the plethora of social media providers need to be the ones who filter out what they
determine is false or misleading. Even Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that “there hadn't been �me to
_fully vet a bunch of the scien��c assump�ons and unfortunately I think a lot of the establishment… asked for a_
_bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true”. ¹_ It is clear from the
defini�ons the bill gives, some of which are shown above, that ACMA are given power to determine and police
**what is true and what is false. If ACMA were God, I would consider this to be acceptable. They are fallible and**
may not know the truth in every situa�on. The government has also proven �me and �me again, they are not
wise, and many, many things they have claimed to be true, are at best poorly fabricated and barely camouflaged
lies, designed to deceive the public in order to achieve the agenda that the government had at the �me.

It is my opinion that there are clear examples of when, during the covid pandemic, the government pushed the
line that “the covid shots are safe and effec�ve.” This has proven to be disinforma�on with thousands of people
who have had significant adverse effects from the covid vaccine.² From my own family there were four who
suffered significant adverse effects two of whom are s�ll suffering. Anyone who spoke against the official view or
tried to give evidence that exposed the false informa�on were shut down. Then there was the statement
**“When we reach 80% vaccinated this will give herd immunity and the pandemic will end.” This did not happen.**
**“The shots will protect you from catching covid.” This is a lie, as I have so many family members and friends**
who had mul�ple shots and s�ll suffered with covid, some of whom suffered from covid twice and were
hospitalised. Another false statement was that “If you do not get vaccinated, you are not caring for the elderly
**who are more suscep�ble.” Anyone with covid, whether they are vaccinated or not, can infect others. What**
about the statement - “The mRNA vaccines are over 85% protec�on against covid” This is simply a rela�ve
protec�on compared with being unvaccinated. The absolute protec�on is actually 0.89% improvement.⁵
**“Lockdowns are the way out this pandemic and back to normal.” This has been proven disinforma�on. “Masks**
**will prevent transmission.” Not true. “Trust the science.” There was no true science being followed.**

documents indicate that there was no peer reviewed double-blind study done to verify the safety or
effec�veness of the covid vaccine. And finally, “Ivermec�n is dangerous and is banned for use against covid.” Or
that “an�-viral medica�on is dangerous and will not help people with covid.” So ivermec�n and an�virals were
banned un�l recently where now the mantra has changed to “See your doctor to get an�-viral medica�on to
help you recover more quickly from covid.” There is now silence from the government on the earlier official
narra�ve. At the beginning of the pandemic, any professional, doctor scien�st, epidemiologist, virologist, or lay
person who spoke against the covid shots or suggested an�virals, were silenced. Many of those professionals
have lost their job or had severe restric�ons place on them under threat of legal ac�on against them.

Anyone who spoke differently to the official view was quickly shut down so that their so called “misinforma�on
and disinforma�on” would not be aired for any more �me than it took for the social media “truth police” “fact
checkers” to spot it and remove it. As it turns out, many of the “conspiracy theories” turned out to have a large
amount of accurate informa�on which should have been available to the general public right from the start.

# Conclusion

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian. In defining what cons�tutes the values of

of associa�on” is so important that it is at the top of its list.³

Australia is a founding member of the United Na�ons and an original signatory of the Universal Declara�on of
Human Rights (UDHR). Ar�cle 18 of that declara�on reads: Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or
in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, prac�ce, worship
and observance.⁴ Ar�cle 19 takes this right even further: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
informa�on and ideas through any media and regardless of fron�ers.

The Founding Fathers of the United States laboured long over the ques�on of liberty. According to Benjamin
Franklin, “Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a na�on, must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.”

How can the government who chose to deceive the masses for their own purposes, be trusted to be the holders
of all truth and have the power, or give the power to ACMA, to silence those who speak a narra�ve that
disagrees with the ‘official view’?

You may disagree with me, and that is your right. But if all views are not expressed, then the debate is not a
debate at all but is a monologue. If open and honest debate is not permi�ed, the truth may never be exposed,
and those who oppose the official narra�ve will be treated as criminals. This is not democracy, this is
dictatorship. As George Washington said, ‘If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be
_led, like sheep to the slaughter.’_ **The government condemned and silenced those who had a different view for**
**the treatment of covid than the official view. There was no room for debate, as all debate on the ma�er was**
**silenced by the government. This undemocra�c approach to answering difficult health ques�ons, shows that**
**the government already oversteps their authority. If this bill is passed and becomes law, the government will**
**have, through ACMA, even greater powers to silence, fine, and perhaps, jail anyone who expresses a differing**
**view to the government approved narra�ve.**

I, therefore, express my strong opposi�on to this bill on the grounds that it is undemocra�c and uncons�tu�onal.
Freedom of expressing my views, even if my views are wrong, is what makes this country such a wonderful
democracy. I believe that the vast majority of Australians would not want their freedoms eroded away, or the
freedom of speech removed completely, as this bill will accomplish if enacted.

Thank you for taking the �me to read and consider my views, both posi�ve and nega�ve.
