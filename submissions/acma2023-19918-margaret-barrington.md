# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and


# Disinformation) Bill 2023 is to protect “the safety and wellbeing of


# Australians,” it appears to be an attempt to reclaim the information ground


# lost to social media platforms.


I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the Communications Legislation

Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As a

concerned citizen, I firmly believe that the proposed legislation threatens the very

essence of free speech and undermines the principles of a free and democratic

society.

In a world where digital platforms have become integral to our daily lives, the issue of

free speech has taken centre stage. It is the cornerstone of any democratic society,

empowering citizens to voice their opinions, express their beliefs, and hold those in

power accountable. However, recent discussions surrounding the introduction of a

federal government-controlled digital and social media monitoring system in Australia

have sparked concerns about the potential erosion of this fundamental right.

Free speech is the lifeblood of a democratic society, fostering an environment that

encourages open debate, diversity of thought, and the exchange of ideas. It enables

citizens to challenge prevailing norms, question authority, and advocate for change.

Through free speech, marginalised voices are amplified, and societal progress is

made possible. By stifling free speech, we risk silencing dissenting opinions and

limiting the scope of our collective growth.

The proposal for a federal government-controlled monitoring system over digital and

social media platforms raises legitimate concerns about the potential infringement on

free speech. Granting a centralised authority unchecked control over monitoring and

regulating online speech opens the door to abuse of power, censorship, and the

suppression of dissenting views.

At its core, the debate surrounding free speech is not only about digital platforms or

regulations—it is about the vitality of democracy itself. Free speech acts as a

safeguard against authoritarianism, allowing citizens to challenge those in power and

demand accountability. History has shown that the erosion of free speech often

paves the way for the erosion of other civil liberties. It is crucial that we remain

vigilant and actively advocate for the preservation of this fundamental right.

The broad powers granted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority

(ACMA) raise significant alarm. The lack of clear guidelines and accountability

mechanisms for determining what constitutes misinformation and disinformation is

deeply troubling. Who holds the authority to define these terms, and how can we

ensure that this power is not abused for political or ideological purposes?

The Bill's inclusion of the term "serious harm" as a criterion for intervention is

ambiguous and subject to interpretation. The potential for government agencies to

decide what ideas or information are likely to cause "serious harm" raises concerns

about the suppression of dissenting views and stifling of robust public discourse. It is

crucial to remember that the foundations of a healthy democracy rely on open

debate and the exploration of diverse perspectives.

Furthermore, the exclusion of certain forms of content, such as "professional news

content" and government-authorised content, from the purview of the ACMA's

powers raises questions about equal treatment and impartiality. It is essential to

create a level playing field where all voices, regardless of their source, can contribute

to the democratic conversation.

As a citizen, I value the freedom to access and share a wide range of opinions, even

those that may be controversial or challenge prevailing narratives. The potential

penalties outlined in the Bill, including substantial fines for individuals and

corporations, create a climate of fear and self-censorship, which is antithetical to the

principles of an open and democratic society.

In conclusion

Digital and social media platforms have revolutionised the way we communicate and

share information. They have democratised the public discourse, giving a voice to

individuals who were previously unheard. These platforms have become invaluable

tools for organising social movements, advocating for social justice, and shining a

light on societal issues. Overregulation threatens to stifle these positive aspects,

curbing the very essence of free speech that makes these platforms powerful agents

for change.

I strongly urge the government to reconsider the proposed legislation and engage in

a more inclusive and transparent process that includes thorough public consultation.

Protecting Australians from harm should not come at the cost of sacrificing our

fundamental democratic values.

I encourage you to genuinely consider the opinions and perspectives of the citizens

you represent.
