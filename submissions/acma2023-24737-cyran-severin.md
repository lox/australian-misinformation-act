Denounce Albanese’s Orwellian social media censorship law:

The censorship of widely distributed information is unethical. Much of our world is constituted by ideas
and opinions which need to be socially and visibly accessible to people. Without this humanity’s ability
to share themselves and evolve in a social psychological manner becomes impinged and truncated and
will have a negative social impact as a result.

Allowing the information made publicly accessible to be censored by an idealised group is akin to a
Nazism state. Allowing for the dictation and reproduction of somebodies notion of “right” or “true”
information without needing to be proven or substantiated by actual finds, critically cited, or historical
accounts and data, overrides the fundamental freedom of expression.

The suppression of social criticism and widespread thought processing that would eventuate from this
proposition, would cripple society and the education of humans as a whole. The ethical and
humanitarian moral lines that this crosses are substantial, effectively destroying freedom of speech and
opinion.

The idealised nature also leaves a lot to be desired as it can all to easily be used for nefarious purposes
and utilised in such a manner for suppression of actual information on environmental, legal, scientific
and medical fronts, allowing larger entities such as corporations and those with political sway, to put
forward misinformation and essentially “buy” or coerce their personal narrative to the greater populous
all while repressing any and all opposition to said narrative.

All in all, this grab for power over information should be seen as an act of national terrorism rather than
an act of governance due to its antisocial and unethical nature.
