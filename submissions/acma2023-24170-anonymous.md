Misinformation/Disinformation Bill.

The last three years has taught me not to trust my Government both locally, federally and
organisations such as TGA, AHPRA, AMA and Legacy Media to name a few.

Why then do I reject a legislative body if passed that would be responsible for misinformation/
disinformation.

The previous three years have been littered with information classed as conspiracy theories
primarily in connection with C19 and yet almost every one of these conspiracies have been
scientifically proven to be factual.

Ivermectin and it’s successful application around the world (see WHO Uttar Pradesh, https://
www.who.int/india/news/feature-stories/detail/uttar-pradesh-going-the-last-mile-to-stopcovid-19) ( https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-government-saysivermectin-helped-to-keep-deaths-low-7311786/) EU Covid enquiry, spread of C19 fi lies by

company officials.

TGA relied on FDA when the pfizer documents proved that EUA should never have been granted
because of the dangers of the mRNA. The list is endless.

The legacy media in particular, the ABC were biased in the extreme in favour of the federal and
local governments, the same narrative was also afforded to Bigpharma.

Up until 2019 the scientific community was allowed to debate the validity of their findings and be
judged by their peers, that all went out the door. If we are to believe a misinformation/
disinformation bill will be better than what we have currently, please explain why the situations
above were allowed to thrive unchecked.

Unqualified fact checkers from our most trusted universities are now allowed to defame and
slander individuals in the name of science and being paid for their services ( https://
www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/media-and-communication/industry/factlab) who are
these people that will be the arbiters of truth that we the people are to put our complete trust in?

For myself, my family and friends, before agreeing to any future misinformation/disinformation bill
we need many answers explaining what went wrong during the last three years that have brought
this once great country to it’s knees.
