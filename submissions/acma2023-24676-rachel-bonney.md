I grew up in the Western Democracy of Australia. A country where many brave young men and women
fought to maintain our freedoms. My father also fought as a British Marine on the beaches of Normandy
to preserve these freedoms.

In Australia, our current laws allow for freedom of speech and thought in all areas, unless it is deemed
harmful, hurtful or is intended to incite violence. However, it appears that the current government
doesn’t believe that thinking, adult Australians should have the right to retain these freedoms moving
into the future.

Censorship is a tool used by communist countries such as China and North Korea and has never been
acceptable in free nations such as ours.

During Covid, many of our freedoms were eroded or removed entirely, such as the ability to question
the mainstream narrative, or be subjected (against the Nuremburg Code) to experimental medical
procedures, without informed consent.

Now the Government plans to have a Department/Committee that oversees speech, thought, comment
or debate on all Social Media platforms. Meaningful debate and questioning of decisions made by those
in power, is what made our nation great. Once freedoms like these are shut down, our final ability to
question is removed. Our government is supposed to be made up of people selected, of the people, by
the people, and for the people. Therefore, all members of society should have the right to ask for
explanations of any government decisions. Doing this is a healthy debate. It is not presenting
misinformation or disinformation, even if it doesn’t agree with the opinions of others. The ability to
question should never be removed or we are no better than a socialist or totalitarian state.

Who are these people that decide what is disinformation or misinformation? They are just ordinary
Australians, just like us. Therefore, our opinion is as valid as theirs, and in some cases more educated or
researched.

Leave our freedoms alone, and do not pass this bill.
