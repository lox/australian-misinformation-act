FEEDBACK ON THE EXPPOSURE DRAFT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS
LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2023

DO NOT TAMPER WITH THE CITIZENS’ RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.

DO NOT USE TERMS SUCH AS DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION TO
HIDE BEHIND IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS OF FREE
SPEECH.

THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND WHAT IS DEEMED MIS/DIS
INFORMATION TO ONE, MAY CONSTITUTE THE TRUTH TO OTHERS. DEBATE
IS THE ONLY NATURAL WAY THAT FREE IDEAS CAN BE DISCUSSED,
CRITIZED OR ACCEPTED. WE DON’T NEED A (CORRUPT) GOVERNMENT
BODY TO REGULATE FREE SPEECH.

IT IS COMPLETELY DISINGENUOUS TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH AN
“OPPORTUNITY” TO GIVE AN OPINION ABOUT THIS BILL BUT EXPECT THAT
EVERYDAY PEOPLE READ A 60 PAGE DOCUMENT THAT IS ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS BILL IN ORDER TO RESPOND.

**_THE ONLY QUESTION YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED WITHOUT ANY_**
**_DOCUMENTATION IS:_**

## DO YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE AWAY FREE SPEECH AND TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT SAY, DISCUSS, HAVE VIEWS ON ETC.

 The resounding answer would be:

# NO

## KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH (OR WHAT’S LEFT OF IT)!!!!
