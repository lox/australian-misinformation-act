This bill totally destroys the freedom of speech and human rights enshrined in our constitution.
It allows government and authorised officers to decide what is hate speech, misinformation and
disinformation and excludes the Government, Education and Media for the laws. So basically
they can spread what ever misinformation and disinformation they like and not be accountable.
This bill should by thrown out immediately.
