# Submission to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Contact Details

I am research fellow in the Department o . I have

been an active researcher and scientist in the field of Neuroscience for over a decade.

The bill as it seems to me is clumsily drafted and extremely anti-science as it will enable
### bureaucrats or some government-nominated authority to determine what information/ideas are
correct and what are incorrect. This will then promote self-censorship, suppress open
discussions and discourse, and place a mouth gag on any contradicting point of view. As such,
it will provide the government-nominated authority with the power to endanger our democratic
### values including intellectual freedom, freedom of expression and the very fundamental right of political Communication. It is a reminder of “ignorance is strength” proposal directly out of Orwell’s 1984.

As such, it is my stance that the bill should not be approved, given the wide range of risks
involved in passing this bill. Establishing precise definitions for misinformation and
### disinformation is a formidable challenge given the landscape of growing scientific knowledge
and technological advances with increased complexities of financial conflicts of interest.
