To whom it may concern,

I am emailing you because I would like to voice my concern and disapproval of the newly proposed misinformation
bill. I don’t think it’s in the public’s best interest to suppress any information whether it be correct or incorrect.

I believe that misinformation should be argued against with facts, not censorship. Setting up a council which can
deliberate weekly with the public on matters concerning false information by providing facts is a far better
alternative and would also create some jobs.

I am in fear that this bill is a step in the wrong direction for democracy.

Kind regards,
Reuben Rudduck
