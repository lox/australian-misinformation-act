I believe this Bill could begin the erosion of democratic rights and freedoms we have built and
enjoyed over time.

We have always had information that could be considered questionable, but it has always been in
the domain of the individual to assess and act accordingly. Its never been for a government body to
decide and dictate what is misinformation and disinformation.

As a rational person, i can assess information that can be correct or incorrect,that would account for
the majority of the Australian population, so again why is this proposed legislation necessary.

We are all too aware of countries that have less than democratic principles who dictate the flow of
information, so when a government starts going down that path, what are the parameters and who
enforces them.

There’s a reason the American founding fathers enshrined freedom of speech in the US Constitution.
It’s the same reason that Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia in
1948 helped to draft, states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

If we are to learn anything from history, that is many people have suffered and died for the principle
of democratic rights and freedoms we take for granted today, just as my parents fought and suffered
in the second world war for those very same principles.

Thanks for reading.
