ACMA Submission:
# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
Aristotle:
He insisted that the Earth must be in the middle because earth (the element) always sought to
move toward its “natural place,” the centre of the cosmos. Even though Aristotle invented formal
logic, he apparently did not notice a certain amount of circularity in his argument. It took a
while, but in 1543 Copernicus made a strong case for Aristotle being mistaken. And then in 1610
Galileo’s observation that sealed the case for a sun-centred solar system.

The Vatican famously imprisoned Galileo and forced him to recant his scientific assertions that
the Earth revolves around the Sun to avoid being burned at the stake.

Under Stalin, the Soviet government supported the science of Lysenko, a pseudo scientist who
rejected basic principles in biology, because his theories supported the principles of Marxism.
This gave rise to Lysenkoism, a term used to reference the manipulation of the scientific process
to achieve ideological goals. This term seems more and more relevant today.

There’s the matter of society’s control over how science is conducted. Scientists, the normal
humans that they are, are just as susceptible to being swept up by the cultural currents and
politics of their society as anyone else. This would apply to any single entity determining 'Truth'.

“One thing I did learn in science is that to prove your theory, you have to have a control. How
can they prove that bones are millions of years old? My bible tells me the earth is not that old“.
Would questioning the Bible constitute misinformation or is the Bible untruthful? It is vitally
important to encourage differing opinions and beliefs and not have a single entity determine what
is false or misinformation, thus, not repeating the many political errors of yesteryear.

Conclusion.
There are problems with using law to restrict or prohibit certain types of public debate, including
but not limited to:

(i) the inherent imprecision of law for regulating complex and rapidly evolving social

debate;

(ii) the difficulties of enforcing legal restrictions on an activity that is international in scope;
(iii) the limited predictability of the consequences of restricting articulation of societal

activity;

(iv) inertia in the legislative process; and

(v) the susceptibility of legislators and regulators to inappropriate factors and influence.

Therefore, I submit that the Bill is not fit for purpose and should not be enacted.
