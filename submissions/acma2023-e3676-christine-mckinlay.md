If this Bill is passed, it will mean the end of free speech on digital platforms. Only those views, opinions and
### information approved by the Government of the day, will be allowed.

We know this well, because over the last 3 and a half years, any information or opinion which did not
### support the Government narrative, was labelled - "misinformation", - regardless of how factually accurate that information was. And now the Government wants to enshrine this process in law!

If this Bill comes into effect, it will stifle the free flow of ideas, information and thought, so necessary for
human progress and development. People need to be able to talk, discuss, exchange information and ideas
and debate freely, without the fear of massive fines or imprisonment, for saying something that somebody
else has decided is "misinformation". Remember that at one stage, saying that the earth was round was
regarded as "misinformation".

Under this legislation a handful of bureaucrats would get to decide what is true or false. What an absurd
and very dangerous proposition for society. Their decisions would be based on Government approved
'experts' and would be a reflection of the biases and agenda of the Government of the day. As we know, in
### the medical field, for example, there are many experts who have differing opinions. Under this law, the Government would choose those experts who supported their narrative and only allow those opinions to
be communicated    - to the great cost and detriment to human health. This has already been happening
### over the past few years but this legislation would make it even harderfor those voices that didn't agree with the Government's narrative, to be heard. Many eminent scientists and doctors who were vilified and de-platformed over this time, have since been vindicated and history will judge them very well.

Over the last 3 and a half years, most of the ideas or opinions which were labelled as "misinformation" or
conspiracy theories, have proven to be true. Here is an example of just four    -

1. We were told that Ivermectin was a dangerous horse-worming paste and it's use for Covid was banned in
Australia. We knew at the time, but it is more widely known now, that in fact, Ivermectin is a Noble
Prize-winning drug which has been used for decades in humans as is one of _the_ _safest_ human medicines        - far
safer than Paracetamol for instance. It was largely responsible for the eradication of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh,
India, along with Vitamin C, Vitamin D and Zinc. Uttar Pradish had an exceptionally low vaccination rate. The
use of Ivermectin has resulted in a 74% reduction in Covid deaths in Peru       - as a recently released
peer-reviewed study has shown. Numerous studies have shown that it has an up to 80% and higher,
effectiveness rate in treating Covid. In the case of Ivermectin, it was the Australian Government and it's Chief
Health Officers who were _spreading_ _dangerous_ _misinformation._ The use of Ivermectin would have saved
countless lives!! It would have stopped Covid in it's tracks, had it been allowed as a prophylactic and early
treatment!

1. The claim that the virus came from a lab in Wuhan was denounced as a conspiracy theory. We now
know, that this is indeed where it came from and that Fauci and scientists conspired to say that it
was a conspiracy theory.

1. We were told that the vaccine ingredients remained at the injection site. However, under a FOI
### document obtained from the TGA, we now know that the TGA knew in January of2021, that the
vaccine went to ALL organs of the body!! They even knew how much accumulated in the various
organs. We were deceived!

1. We were told that the Covid 'vaccine' was "safe" and "effective" and that anyone saying anything
### different was spreading misinformation. However, we know that it does not stop infection or transmission and that Pfizer did not even test it for transmission before releasing it It also does not

### who are now left disabled or with terrible medical conditions or who have lost their lives to the
Covid 'vaccine'.

### Would this ACMA body need to prove that what they have labelled as "misinformation" is actually false - or would they just get to enforce Government policy without accountability?

Under this legislation the Labor party would be sending us back to the Dark Ages when people who
### thought differently were persecuted, imprisoned or killed. It has always been those who have thought
'outside the square', who dared to go against the status quo, who have progressed society. This Bill would
### stunt human progress! On digital platforms we would be limited to Government approved 'truth' - a really sinister concept. Our society would be greatly diminished as a result!

This proposed legislation is _itself_ _a_ grave threat to the    - _"safety_ _and_ _wellbeing_ _ofAustralians,_ _as_ _well_ _as_ _to_ _our_
_democracy,_ _society_ _and_ _economy"._ It is Anti-Democracy! It is a cynical ploy to control the information that
Australians receive    - to ensure that they only receive information that supports and promotes the
Government's agenda    - just as they do in Communist China and North Korea and in other totalitarian
regimes.

Oh, and of course, politicians would be exempt from their own legislation    - free to spread misinformation
and disinformation at will    - with impunity.

Is this how you want your children, grandchildren and future generations of Australians to live      - under the
### control of the Government of the day, that decides what is true and false and what can be communicated on
digital platforms? Under such a law, there would never be any need to teach critical thinking in schools
because the Government would have already decided for us what is true and what is not true. Is this what
you want Labor's legacy to be??

I implore you, in the name of democracy, free speech, respect for human intelligence, thought and
expression    - and _human_ _development_ _and_ _progress_ _-_ to scrap this dangerous proposed legislation.
