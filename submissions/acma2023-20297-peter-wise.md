New ACMA Powers Submission.

Your new proposed powers are not putting Australia in the forefront. Just the opposite,
taking us back to serfdom.

Who defines misinformation, do we have a vote on it. No the bureaucracy decides. So you
are proposing to censor free speech at the whim of bureaucrats and politicians. I am quite
capable of deciding for myself what I want to listen to and believe. I do not wish to be
dictated to by the aforementioned people.

If I am able to vote then I can likewise discern what to listen to and believe.

The proposal smacks of a means by which government can silence opposition and criticism
and favour those media which will “kowtow to the party line “. This is not democratic, it is
tyranny.

I do not support this legislation. There is no argument put forward to justify it. We have
been doing just fine without such draconian measures.

Yours faithfully
