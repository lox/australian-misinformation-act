This bill if implemented would be detrimental to the Democratic way we in Australia have the privilege to live under.
It is totally discriminatory to give power to any organisation to shut down the right of an individual to express an opinion openly
,should they disagree .
In Australia we live by the Charter of Human Rights and this must not be forgotten or abused.

Our Government, which ever one happens to be democratically elected at the time, should not have total power over any media
to demand they eliminate certain discussions on their digital platforms, and certainly not be fined ridiculous fines by the
Government should they not do so .

This authoritarian approach will decrease trust in our governments. This will prove disastrous for our country and will foster
mistrust in the Government.
This is the reason I wish to make this public submission and It may be used publicly as I have been supportive of the Australian
Canberra Declaration for over 8 years and follow their Christian principals .

Please do not allow this Bill to be passed.
