Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Hello,

I think a great strength of western democracy is free speech and the ability to debate diverse opinions. Sometimes
facts are not so black and white and we need to openly debate the facts and openly contest if we have contrary
evidence.

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a
non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
