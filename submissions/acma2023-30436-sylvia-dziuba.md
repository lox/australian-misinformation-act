If it looks like communism, and if it smells like communism, it must be communism. I

should know; I grew up in it.

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

Disinformation) Bill 2023 is nothing, but another lever designed to censor the public

and take away free speech.

The bill is saying “We’ll keep you safe from harm”, but all it is is communism in white

gloves.

How do I know that?

Firstly, it proposes to give exemptions to the government, educational institutions

and news outlets.

Why is this wrong? These institutions should be held to the highest account, yet they

have been the largest sources of misinformation and disinformation throughout

history, but none more so than in the last few years.

For example, they have spread disinformation and, even worse, have withheld

scientific information regarding Covid-19.

The biggest lie being that the vaccines were going to ‘stop the spread of the virus’ –

which they didn’t.

Even more damage was done when these institutions misled the Australian public by

telling them the vaccines were “safe”. My friend’s mum, a healthy 38-year-old woman

whose heart stopped less than 48 hours after taking the jab, would beg to differ. So

would the thousands of healthy young men who will have to take medication for the

rest of their lives for Myocarditis and pericarditis.

We should have been told, we should have been aware of the pros and cons of

taking the vaccine. We should have had the right to make an informed decision. But

what did we get? Misinformation, disinformation, lockdowns, mandates and

coercions.

The only people that were providing scientific data at the time, are the very people

that ACMA, given the chance, will try to silence for good.

Why didn’t these institutions tell these young men that the mortality rate for men in

their age group is 0.1%? Regardless of health status. And for healthy subjects it’s

almost 0%.

We need people who are willing to defy the already restrictive social media platform

rules to challenge these institutions. Their voices cannot be silenced.

We know that, already, anyone who opposes the mainstream narrative is cancelled

and de-platformed, with these new rules, ACMA will have the right to put a final nail

in that coffin.
