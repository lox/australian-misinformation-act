Have your say – Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

I am not a social media user and I have no idea what is being talked about at any time or on
any subject. I choose not to listen at all, others may choose to listen or not to listen when
their interest takes them. Excluding the limited range of topics of conversation which are
illegal in the national interest, eg terrorism related, I do not believe that the Government
should have any more authority about what someone else is saying in a social setting than
any individual. We can get up and walk away from a conversation, or we can choose to hang
up or push the stop button. The government is not elected to have control over the
consciences or moral choices of those who democratically elected them. This Bill aims to do
just that.  Freedom of thought and speech underpins democracy.

What is truth? As is often pointed out to us we live in a post-truth world.  Whose truth will
we live by? Surely not a government’s? Many failures on many practical levels would seem
to render every government ineligible to also direct the consciences and moral choices of
the citizens that elected them in the first place.  This proposed law seems to me to be a sure
and certain way of wiping out democracy altogether and over the years that hasn’t worked
out too well for governments or peoplel

The error of government imposing truth on its people is most recently evident in the way
government tried so hard to drown out the voices of anyone who dissented from the
government line on Covid, who had an alternative truth to the government’s truth.
Hopefully one day we will know the extent of the hearts and spirits broken, the lives spoilt if
not ruined, lost even, and the fruitlessness of the government’s truth.

I think many of the Australian people are more cautious, more aware of what devastation
government unchecked could accomplish and this proposed toe-in-the-door legislation
would produce government unchecked for sure. No Ministry of Truth for us!
