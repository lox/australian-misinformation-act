How is it right to Stop us from having our freedom of Speech? So the Government can do and say whatever they
want. And if we oppose it. We can’t say anything? Yet this Government has the power to do anything they want?
Without opposition?

We are becoming like China. Which of course is what they want. I’m opposing this and hoping that you will put this
forward. And defend the Australian a People. We are the ones who are paying this Government wages. It’s Time
they defended the people like they should be. The Government Works for us.
