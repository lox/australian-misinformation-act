# 1 Summary
The scientific process relies on the testing of all available data and retaining the most credible model
based on an unbiased analysis of the results. Unless ACMA has perfect knowledge of the entire
universe, this bill will make science illegal.

Academia and all research similarly require access to any and all information available to select the
best model based on unbiased analysis. Unless ACMA has complete and perfect knowledge of
everything, this bill makes research illegal.

When people learn, they compare new information with currently held beliefs and test both to
determine if the new knowledge is worth retaining. This bill could prevent people from accessing
any and all information, making learning illegal.

Most teaching presents students with several models of the subject matter, as the history of the
development of knowledge is as relevant as the knowledge itself, and often understand why bad
ideas do not work informs the understanding of the good, so limiting what can be taught makes
teaching illegal.

Balanced journalism relies on the unbiased presentation of “both sides of the story.” While it has
been some time since we have seen that in the mainstream media, this bill will restrict explaining
“the other side”, making unbiased journalism illegal, turning it all into “propaganda”.

# 2 The ACMA bill

## 2.1 “The issue”
The opening statement on the web site for comment submission states that “Misinformation and
disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy,
society and economy” and then suggests a bill that would make Josef Stalin blush, eliminating free
speech, unbiased research or teaching of any kind, proposing giving censor powers to an unelected
bureaucratic body (appointed by the Labor Party) to silence any dissent, critique or even data that
would challenge any policy or position – the most direct attack on democracy, and providing clear
indication as to the motives behind this disgusting proposal. This statement and bill seems to
suggest that individuals do not have the ability to test information, compare opposing ideas and
make a personal judgement as to what constitutes “the truth.” In reality, democracy CANNOT
FUNCTION without the free sharing of ideas and information and therefore this assertion is patently
false, even creating the impression that this bill and associated materials has the objective to
deceive.

## 2.2 The premise
The Bill proposes to give powers to ACMA to “combat disinformation and misinformation”, new
words in the English language basically indicating “unacceptable information”, the question is “to
who?” For the idea of giving ACMA these powers, it logically follows that ACMA must have complete
and full knowledge and understanding of everything in the universe, which is a ridiculous premise.

## 2.3 The unaffected
It is curious that parties excluded from the provisions of this bill are:

1. The government and its organisations
2. The mainstream media

This gives a sole “license to lie” (propaganda) those that are to be held accountable by the media in
a democracy (government), and the mainstream media who is responsible for holding such
individuals accountable, indicating a coordinated framework for communist-style propaganda.

It precludes private individuals and independent media from questioning public issues, and coming
from a communist country I can assure you that this rings very familiar.

## 2.4 The empowered – and undermining democracy
ACMA is an unelected bureaucratic institution. That means that citizens have no say in who serves
on its management. As with all unelected bureaucratic institutions, this creates the opportunity to,
for example, the Labor Party to appoint individuals sympathetic to its cause, and for ACMA to then
wield power and silence opposition on behalf of the Labor Party even when such party is not in
power. This is a REAL threat to democracy, and the way autocratic dictators deny their citizens
access to information to control them.

## 2.5 Harm
Included in the definition of “harm” in the proposed Bill is:

(a) “hatred”, which is an emotion experienced within the mind of an individual. Pray tell how a

court and / or independent observer should examine such “evidence”.

(b) “Disruption of public order or society in Australia” – does this mean that demonstrations are

not allowed? Would exposing corruption then undermining the credibility of the
government be interpreted as a “disruption of public order or society?”

(c) “Harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State or

local government institutions” – this seems to confirm the comment on (b)

(d) “Harm to the health of Australians” – could include questioning the efficacy of experimental

gene therapies.

(e) “Harm to the Australian environment” – really? Information can do that?
(f) “Economic or financial harm to Australian, the Australian economy or a sector of the

Australian economy” – how can information do that? Certainly, any such occurrences would
be covered by Defamation Law?

If information is not true, and such information causes harm to any person or institution, such
individuals or organisations have access to the courts through defamation laws, where truth is the
most potent defence – where it follows that information that may be damaging to the reputation of
an individual or organisation, but which is true should be shared in the public interest if true.

# 3 Conclusions
The “harm” covered in the proposed Bill mimics that covered by Defamation Law. This raises the
question as to why this Bill is required – defamation law is well established in Australia. Some
potential reasons could be:

1. Establishing a bureaucracy that can continue to promote the agenda of the Labor Party only.
2. Since this bureaucratic institution in unelected, this body would continue to promote the

interests of the Labor Party even if an alternative party comes to power - a gross abuse of
power and public resources.

3. This same unelected agency could be used to censor all political opponents or challenges to

Labor policies or any information that could lead to a negative impact on the Labor Party.

4. As the unelected bureaucracy would be supported by public funding, challenging such body

would pitch opponents against ACMA with access to the entire revenue of Australia at their
disposal – a predetermined outcome.

5. The proposed censorship mechanism would make it impossible to report on political

misdeeds or corruption, removing all means of holding government accountable.

6. As the mainstream media companies are owned by the same companies that lobby

government (and sometimes pay “development fees”), the selective “license to lie” will have
predictable, atrocious outcomes.

There is no positive outcome of this legislation. This should NOT be allowed to pass, and the
individuals who developed, sponsored and supported this should be named so that voters can make
an informed decision with the next election. It is likely that this originated from outside Australia
based on the fact that at this time similar legislation is proposed for Canada, South Africa, the USA
and so on. In any case, the citizens and voters of Australia should be informed who in our
government do NOT govern in the best interests of Australia, but

If this is allowed to pass, it will send Australian to the Dark Ages, if not the Stone Age.
