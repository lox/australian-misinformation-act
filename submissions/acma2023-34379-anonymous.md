Submission on the New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation.

I do not agree that these powers are at all necessary. I have deep concerns on who is deemed the
arbiter of truth. I am absolutely in disbelief that Australia has come to this. What is proposed is
what one would expect to be enforced in countries of communist background, not a supposedly
democratic, free society.

Does our Government think that Australians are stupid?
that we cannot think for ourselves and discern what is information and what is misinformation?
Every person in Australia has the right to free speech and the right to express ideas and
information without interference of any Government body.

Anybody that thinks that these new powers are ok, have no regard for future generations and their
freedoms as Australians. Nobody in history that has ever tried to silence people has ever turned
out to be the good guy.

I completely reject this proposed legislation.
