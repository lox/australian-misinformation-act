A private man submission on the

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023

The proposal to monitor and surveil information on any platform, but particularly moreso in
the ever increasing digital platforms, is in itself an affront to the men and women of Australia.

The ACMA powers will strengthen and support the existing voluntary framework established
by the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (the voluntary
code), and will extend to non-signatories of the voluntary code.

A plethora of unlawful, immoral, unethical and unconstitutional issues are readily evident.

Why would the existing process and safeguards for authorising wiretap, surveillance,
warrants of electronic communications be made redundant at the stroke of a pen in favour of
providing widespread and broad powers to a non-elected public servant or private
contractor(s) without any further overview. The simple reply is that the existing processes
must be maintained and if anything strenghten to further limit the excessive government
overreach.

Whom decides what is misinformation and, or, disinformation? The fact that this proposal
allows someone [or something given the widespread use of artificial intellegence ] to classify
content as misinformation or disinformation, or erronous, or exagerated, or understated, or
overstated, or only partially true, or biased, or insulting, or any other classifcation for that
matter, is downright dictatorial.

Whom, or what, decides ? The Bill sounds like another big stick weapon in the government
arsenal to be used on the women and men.

Where does the Minister for Communications gain his moral or lawful approval to introduce
such a draconian Bill ? The simple answer is that the Bill is neither morally correct to impose
on the lives, thoughts and conversations of private men and women of this land. The Bill is
not lawful in any way shape or form and is totally repugnant to the Australian Constitution
and to Natural Law.

Regardless whether ACMA will have the power to request specific content or post removal
from digital platform services the mere fact that the existing voluntary framework will be
extended to non-signatories of the voluntary code is an affront of the highest magnitude.

No consent whatsoever is given to the introduction of this Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This Bill should be
removed and should never be allowed to see the light of day.

Sincerely.

A private man.
