Feedback on proposed ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation.

I am a 59-year-old senior English teacher. I have been a teacher for 15 years and before this I worked
in publishing as a journalist, writer, and editor. The proposed Misinformation and Disinformation Bill
concerns me immensely.

Over the last five years I have noticed a profound change in my classrooms. As an English teacher I
see my main role as facilitating students to develop critical thinking skills through rhetorical debate,
independent research, and good faith argument. An objective approach to argument is almost no
longer possible, as so many students are now too scared to express their opinions on many cultural
issues. The concept of free and fair speech has already been eroded to the point where robust
discussion in no longer possible. Students have separated into three distinct groups: there is a small
social justice cohort who are generally living with profound anxiety about issues such as climate
change, LGBT discrimination, and a perceived explosion of racism. There is a large, disengaged group
in the centre who are rarely invested in their culture, and there is a small, mainly male, group who are
angry and depressed and feel that society has left them behind. They are attracted to more
traditional ideas. Both the social justice group and the traditional group feel they have nothing in
common and see each other as enemies.

In the past, these divisions could have been dissolved where open and honest debate could occur,
where bad ideas are replaced by better ones. In my experience, telling somebody that they are wrong
never changes minds, but allowing access to other ideas, even if these ideas are potentially upsetting,
allows somebody to see the world in less polemical ways. However, because so many issues are
verboten, many teachers censor their classes and focus on more benign topics.

I know these kids and they have more things in common with each other than they think they have,
and it’s a shame they feel they can’t express themselves. Reading the Exposure Draft of the Bill, I fear
that these divisions will grow.

My main concerns are:

      - Whilst disinformation and misinformation are something that the Bill defines as false,
_misleading or deceptive, penalties for these do not apply to excluded groups such as_
‘professional news content’, ‘content authorised by the Commonwealth or a State,’
and ‘content produced for an educational institution’. I believe it is dangerous to
assume that news organisations, governments or even educational institutions are
not capable of issuing misinformation (which misleads) or disinformation (which
_causes actual harm). I can think of many examples where this can be shown:_
weapons of mass destruction, broken election promises, past school curriculum. I
fear this will create an ‘information elite’ who control what is and isn’t acceptable to
say in society. Citizens may self-censor out of fear of penalty, public debate will be
limited to acceptable speech and public trust will be eroded. Perhaps the Bill might
be fairer if it applied to every citizen, government organisation and media producer.
Otherwise, it could further cynicism in our community.

      - It seems the purpose of the Bill is to help avoid harm in the community, however
_harm is not defined in any concrete way: it is simply defined in a circular way where it_
is assumed that the reader knows what the term harm means. However, the idea of
_harm can range from a subjective feeling of being slighted to actual bodily harm. For_
instance, the Bill gives an example of misinformation that leads to ‘Harm of the
_environment.’ Again, harm to the environment could range from cutting lawns to_

irradiating oceans. Unless the definition of harm is something everyone can agree on,
I fear the term will be abused. Besides, serious harm, such as incitement to violence
and coercive abuse, are already illegal under the law.

      - Similarly, the term Hatred also needs to be defined. The Bill cites an example of
_hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race,_
_gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability. Many people_
may be uncomfortable around certain groups. I have often advised my daughters to
be careful around large groups of men at night. Will this equate to hatred?

Ultimately, I am concerned that the vague nature of the amendments will lead to selective application
of disinformation penalties, may lead to people self-censoring their opinions, may push already
polarised groups towards more extreme ideation, may create an information elite who could decide
what is and isn’t acceptable speech, and may further erode public trust in our institutions. I accept
that social media has created an environment where sensational, conspiratorial ideas flourish and
where facts and reason can be subsumed by raw emotion. I can also understand that government
finds itself in a dilemma where it must balance free speech rights against public order disruption, but
nowhere in history has censorship ever led to better outcomes for citizens and I worry that knee jerk
solutions to cultural issues may make things worse in the long run.
