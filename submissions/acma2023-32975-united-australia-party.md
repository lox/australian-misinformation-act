# Stop – You are going in the wrong direction. 


#### There was no time in in history where the people censoring free speech
 were the good guys – RFK Jr


The proposed Bill is a farce, an insult to the past generations that fought and sacrificed to protect the right
to free political speech.

The Bill should be abandoned in its entirety and recognition given to the real threat to democracy coming
from the censorship by foreign Tech Giants. These foreign entities have already interfered in our democracy
by censoring the proceedings of the Parliament and by censoring candidates at our last Federal election.

Just as we wouldn’t have free and fair elections if Australia Post refused to deliver election brochures for a
candidate – we can’t have free and fair elections if Facebook and You Tube are censoring the political
messages candidates.

Facebook, Youtube and the like are not publishers, they are platforms and should be subject to the same
rules and regulations as common carriers.

Therefore, the Bill should be scrapped and replaced will the following;

##### If it is lawful to say something on a soap box in the town square, it’s unlaw for a social media platform to censor it.
