# Misinformation and disinformation:

## Summary:

Misinformation less of a risk than information control in a democracy.

`o` While we recognise that misinformation is problematic:

       - Misuse of information control is widespread and historically inevitable.

       - Misinformation as a social construct is an unrealistic broken idea.

          - Replication crisis

          - Regulatory capture

          - Misaligned Institutional incentives

          - Illusion of experts

`o` Societal group think is a greater risk than perceived misinformation.
`o` Government can be accountable for promoting group think which results in

harm.

`o` If you are not seeing views you completely disagree with in your news feed

then the system is broken

`o` Mitigation is only possible with equal and opposite risk to publication.

       - i.e., unlimited liability for fact checkers

## Discussion:
Misinformation is a dangerous category to address as it easily removes dissenting voices
that should be listened to. Note diversity of thought is about listening to all voices
including ones you disagree with. Failure to do this inevitably results in harm.

The ideas behind misinformation draw heavily on the ideas of Social Constructionism
which, in today’s environment, has become and increasing flawed and dangerous
approach.

Social constructionism is a theory that suggests a statement or fact is deemed "true" when
it is widely cited, replicated, and accepted without disagreement. However, this approach
has become highly problematic in modern echo chambers and particularly in the realm of
science, primarily due to the scientific replication crisis, which is undermining the
fundamental premise of this theory. We simply can’t replicate the claims of significant
parts of peer reviewed science.

In the past two decades, problems caused by seeking reference to social constructionist
arguments have been amplified by inherent flaws ingrained within the systems and
institutions of scientific research, which serve as the gate keepers of this social construct.
We have seen this in both widely recognised regulatory capture and the perverse
incentives for research. If the institutions can only be funded by supporting and
researching a specific narrative, they will not contest the underlying narrative and will
actively prevent others from doing so too.

Suppression of views that challenge the mainstream entrenches the current world view
resulting in stagnation, loss of trust and potentially extensive harms from group think.

Those responsible for setting policies which rely on a social constructionist supporting
arguments, may seek protection from accountability by pointing to the perceived
acceptance of the viewpoint at the time the policies were set. However, if the system is
actively suppressing voices, the system is no longer representing diverse viewpoints, it’s
an echo chamber. The wilful blindness to diverse points of view should be used to hold
the policy maker accountable when policies fail.

Misinformation is a very risky category to address as it often stems from some selfidentifying majority believing they are right and flow on institutional censorship easily
removes dissenting voices that should be listened to. Note diversity of thought is about
listening to all voices including ones you disagree with.

The reality is that other than in constrained contexts, it is risky to appeal to solid facts.
There are observations there are outcomes and there are interpretations. Information is
complex and interpretive; misinformation is often simply an interpretation of the
observations that does not suit a participant.

Disinformation is malicious misinformation may seem a much clearer case. It can be
framed as a deliberate misinterpretation of observations designed to shape public
opinion, sow confusion, undermine trust, or advance a particular agenda. It may involve
distorting facts, fabricating stories, selectively presenting information, or using persuasive
techniques to manipulate emotions and beliefs.

However, the line between misinformation and disinformation can be very thin. From the
perspective of AI "Classification" of information / misinformation, the outcome can be
highly sensitive to context. Correctly addressing "quality" disinformation can be further
challenging simply because of the way it has been interwoven with things we believe to
be “true”. The concept that one can successfully police the internet with AI without
causing off target impact is naïve, more likely it will result in disenfranchising the public
and risks chilling dissenting views which overall is net harmful to democratic society.

## The illusion of experts

Another failure of social constructivism is reliance on “experts”.

All experts and expert communities live in an information bubble, the sheer amount of
information in most fields creates an a constantly changing information horizon beyond
which individuals and groups cannot see combined with an overwhelming amount of new
information, which cannot be assimilated. The result is most fall back on what they think
they know.

The field of AI for instance is hugely diverse and multidisciplinary. Globally publishing rates
in AI stand at ~1300 papers a day and 350 AI patent applications a day. The large AI groups

themselves have openly stated that tracking the field is impossible. Hence one can expect
most views to be based on dogma.

## Mitigations

Building the framework for dictating one's own particular truth, is a recipe for eventual
civic collapse, because we will group think ourselves into bad ideas, as has happened time
and again in the past. Even if the tool can be effectively used, eventually it will be misused.

If a government insists on pursuing this path, then a semblance of balance in such a system
can probably only be achieved if there is equal or larger sanction placed against the fact
checkers and their respective organizations. In this way if information is incorrectly
suppressed and results in harm then the organization and accountable person can be
financially sanctioned to the same or greater extent. This would bring balance and
restraint to the process and reduce the temptation of people to use the tool for political
purposes.

In a healthy system, encountering diverse voices, even those considered unconventional
or extreme, is vital. The presence of differing perspectives in our news feed allows us to
gauge the health and robustness of our societal discourse.
