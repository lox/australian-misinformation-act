# I do not believe misinformafion or disinformafion pose a threat to the safety and/or wellbeing of Australians. However I do believe that the government trying to introduce a new law to allow a single ‘unelected’ body to make our decisions is a significant threat to the autonomy and right to free speech of ALL Australians.
 We are all enfitled to our opinion and our inherent right to debate and discuss topics and mafters that are of concern in today’s society. No single organisafion (and certainly not one funded by the government) have the right to decide what is ‘truth’. We, the people, pay the government their exorbitant salaries and it is fime they started listening and working for us, instead of trying to undermine and take away one of our basic rights – freedom of speech!
