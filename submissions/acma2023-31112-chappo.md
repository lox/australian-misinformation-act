I believe that the proposed communication legislation amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 is a direct attack on Australia’s freedom of speech.

The bills very subjective definition of “misinformation” will give the government arbitrary power to
determine what misinformation is. This can suppress legitimate criticism and the questioning of the
government decisions (such as the voice), science, climate change, immigration policies, agricultural
policies and gender dysphoria.

The protection for the government, mainstream media and approved organisations will lead to an
imbalance of differing voices and viewpoints particularly for independent media and non political
parties.

I call on the government to reject the communication legislation amendment (Combating
Misinformation and Disinformation) bill 2023, as it will threaten freedom of speech in Australia.

I hope the government can listen to the voices of its constituents, and protect the individual rights of
free speech for all Australians.

Thank you.

Regards
