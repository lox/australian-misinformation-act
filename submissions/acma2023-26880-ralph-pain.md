Feedback to an exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-yoursay/new-acma-powers-combat-misinformation-and-disinformation

This exposure draft is a precursor to the proposed introduction of new laws to provide the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with powers to combat
misinformation and disinformation. It appears that the new laws are intended primarily for
reducing harm that may arise from the promulgation of false information.

In my view, there are two main approaches for reducing such harm. One is to identify and
limit false information. The other, in contrast, is to encourage any opinions to be advanced so
that truth can be discovered through debate.

This exposure bill is founded on the first of these two approaches. I object to this approach
for the following reasons.

**General reasons:**

First, freedom to speak allows opinions to be challenged and provides ingredients for
creativity and for synthesising new ideas. In this way, freedom to speak is a foundation for
the processes of democracy and science. Further, freedom to speak is essential for
withstanding the ever-present tendency of a few to impose autocracy or totalitarianism.

However, laws against misinformation or disinformation necessarily inhibit freedom to
speak. Even though there may be an intention declared in Schedule 2, Clause 7 (on p53) that
these laws will be regulated in a manner that "has regard to freedom of expression", in my
view, good intentions can only yield such freedom in the complete absence of laws against
misinformation or disinformation.

Second, we have no need for laws against misinformation or disinformation, because we
already have laws against causing harm, inciting violence, discrimination, defamation, and
libel.

**Particular concerns with the draft:**

Schedule 1

Clause 7 definition of misinformation and disinformation (p12)

_7 (1)(a). My focus here is on the term 'false'. A difficulty arising from including the term_
'false' in the definition of misinformation and disinformation is that truth or falseness is an
opinion. At the time that an opinion is designated as true or false, it cannot be known whether
that opinion will later be considered true or false.

Further, since opinion may be influenced by personal interest, there is a risk that laws
enabling opinions to be designated as misinformation may enable the interests of some to be
imposed over the interests of others. This raises the risk that the interests of the more
powerful may prevail over the interests of the less powerful.

However, this exposure draft goes even further than merely carrying such a risk, and leaves
no question as to whether the interests of the more powerful may prevail over the interests of
the less powerful. This is because, as shown in Clause 6 (page 11), any service specified by
the minister is excluded from the proposed law. Further, in Clause 2 as discussed below, a
number of powerful groups are specifically excluded.

Clause 2 Definitions

`o` Definition of excluded content for misinformation purposes (page 5)

The list of excluded content does not define the content. Instead it defines those producers of
the content who are excluded from the laws under discussion. In particular, those excluded
include professional news media organisations, educational institutions accredited by
government, and the government itself.

We do not need to rely solely on philosophy or ethics to understand that opinions imposed by
government authorities may turn out to be false. We can turn to history. Indeed, we can see
this with recent events during the declared pandemic. It is salient to observe over these years
that opposing opinions have often been censored, and those in authority have often been
vociferous in labelling opposing opinions as misinformation or disinformation.

Some of the many opinions that have been imposed by those in power in a number of
countries have been:

1. The covid virus is definitely not produced in a laboratory involved in enhancing gain of

function

2. The virus is highly dangerous
3. The virus does not discriminate, and there is no way of knowing in advance who is

vulnerable. It can kill young, fit, healthy people as readily as those with fragile immune
systems

4. It would be too difficult to focus protection on only those vulnerable who wished to be

protected

5. There are no existing prophylactics or early treatments for reducing the effects of

infection. In particular, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are useless and even
dangerous for humans. Ivermectin is merely a horse de-wormer

6. Natural immunity following infection is less effective than vaccine-induced immunity
7. Vaccine-induced immunity is the only available way to control the risk of harm. (Use of

supplements such as zinc and vitamins D3 and C was underemphasised)

8. Masks are effective against transmission
9. Only short-term lockdowns of 2 or 3 weeks are needed
10. The spike protein component of the virus particle is non toxic, which means that

vaccinations that introduce just the spike protein will be safe

11. The gene-based mRNA and DNA covid injections are safe, even for children and

pregnant women

12. The injected material remains in the muscle near the site of the injection, where an

immune response will be mounted. The material will not spread to other parts of the body

13. An injection into the main immune compartment of the body, which bypasses the mucosal

membranes of the upper airways, can provoke immunity against a respiratory virus

14. The spike protein is relatively stable against mutation, and so a vaccine that introduces it

will provoke immunity (in the form of IgG antibodies) which will remain effective even if
other components of the virus particle mutate. Thus, a course of at most two injections
will give enduring immunity

15. The injections will stop transmission of the virus. So, by accepting the injections a person

can be confident that they will not infect vulnerable people. Those who do not accept the
injections are selfish and risk becoming Grannie Killers

16. The injections will save an injected person from severe illness and death.

Many opinions once imposed by those in authority have turned out in hindsight to be false.
And many of the opinions of those who challenged the authorities have turned out to be true.
Nevertheless, opinions that challenged the authorities were restricted and labelled
misinformation or disinformation.

Furthermore, the consequential harm of those imposed opinions has been significant both at
national and personal levels:

a) Mass lockdowns slowed economic activity, which necessitated historically-high short
term monetary expansion. Now we have inflation, increasing interest rates, and
impending recession

b) Mass lockdowns caused social isolation, leading to mental illness, and may have led

to harms from lack of normal care

c) Underemphasis of enhancing our immune systems and failure to treat early symptoms

led to unnecessary health risks for individuals

d) Mass vaccination failed to prevent the spread of the virus
e) The population now carries the inherent harms of a medical procedure. The nation

suffers high excess deaths at a phase in a pandemic cycle when we would expect
_lower than normal deaths_

f) The opinion that the injections would prevent transmission led to vaccines being

mandated for employment, leading to loss of income, and hardship in many cases.
Vaccine passports were used to prevent access to services. The adoption of this
opinion also brought many Australian citizens close to believing that unvaccinated
people should be kept in indefinite isolation in camps. Such camps were actually
constructed in some states

g) Despite the proportion of those vaccinated in the population being high, covid is still

being recorded as the cause of death in many instances

Clause 21 Self incrimination p24

Under the Common Law, we have the privilege to refuse to answer questions that may
incriminate ourselves. My understanding is that this privilege was established during the 12th
and 13th centuries. A concern with forcing people to provide evidence that may incriminate
themselves under compulsory interrogation and threat of penalty is that it gives an incentive
to exert pressure, which may lead to conviction of innocent people. Some Star Chamber
confessions in the 17th century were exacted in this way. I object strongly to its removal.

**Conclusion**

This exposure draft carries proposed legislation for enhancing the power of government to
censor opinion.

However, we can see from the recent past that censorship of opposing, or dissenting, opinion
has allowed government authorities to impose actions founded on their own opinion, much of
which has turned out to be arguable if not false. This has led to harm.

In my view, any attempt to identify and limit dissenting opinion carries a risk of harm if the
authorised opinion turns out to be false. One could take the view that laws should be
introduced to prevent governments and other authorities from making false statements or
taking action based on false information. However, since it is often not clear at the time
which statements and what information are true, I feel a better way to reduce the risk of harm
is to enable and bolster the freedom to speak, so that we can work to seek truth through
debate, together.
