12 To provide material for Australians considering making a submission on the proposed legislation to

13 [Information.Integrity@infrastructure.gov.au.](mailto:Information.Integrity@infrastructure.gov.au)

14 **PART 2 – RECOMMENDATIONS**

15 1. That the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

16 _Disinformation) Bill 2023 in it’s current form be abandoned all together based on review and_

17 resultant PART 3 – CONCERNS.

18 a. This serves to ensure ordinary Australians continue to have the ability to share and

19 discuss amongst each other important issues of the day including publishing the

20 results and conclusions of their own research for wide distribution on social media.

21 2. That the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

22 _Disinformation) Bill 2023 be repurposed to expand ACMA powers over regulated/licenced_

23 corporate and Government owned media to ensure misinformation is NOT disseminated to

24 prevent future catastrophes such as the recent COVID Intervention that caused widespread

25 serious harm affecting all ordinary Australians in one way or another.

2 **1.** **Government assuming role of Guardian over the majority of adult Australians**

3 **a)** Forcing social media technology companies to remove content under threat of penalties

4 is to censor information otherwise available to Australians.

5 **b)** Denying access to content implies a majority of adult Australians do not have the

6 capacity to determine information validity in accordance with advice provided by the e
7 Safety commissioner (refer Source 1) to make rational decisions.

**How can I tell if information is true?**
Look out for content that seems very one-sided.
**Ask yourself these questions:**
Is it from a trustworthy source, known for being honest about information?
Does the headline match the content?
Are different views included, to give the content balance?
Do the quotes make sense and match the rest of the story, or do they seem to be missing the
wider context?
Does the content seem to be unbelievable or ‘too good to be true’?
Is there enough evidence and reasoning in the story to justify the claims or conclusion?


8 **c)** Government makes policy and law with the implied consent of the majority in our

9 representative democratic system. Australians fund through escalating public debt

10 multiple Government departments and agencies with budgets totalling in the $billions

11 including but not limited to ASIO, AFP and Homeland Security as well as State/Territory

12 Police that have more than adequate resources to monitor the miniscule number of

13 Australians unable to assess information reasonably that may lead to an act causing

14 _serious harm. Constant surveillance, search and seize powers as well as indefinite_

15 detention without trial are in place ready to be conducted against Australians.

16 **d)** The NSW Trustee and Guardian make clear when guardianship is justified.

If a person's decision-making ability is impaired due to disability, age, mental illness or injury
they may need to have a guardian appointed to make healthcare, lifestyle and medical
decisions on their behalf


17 **e)** If Australians as a population are assumed unable to assess uncensored content in

18 making lifestyle decisions, how can they be trusted to vote for competent politicians?

19 **f)** **SUMMARY STATEMENT 1 – There is no imperative for the Government to intervene in**

20 **the ability of the majority of Australians to make informed decisions by censoring**

21 **information in effect acting as a Guardian on the assumption of mentally**

22 **compromising conditions (illness, injury etc).**

2 **discussions to address purported risks of ‘harm’**

3 **a)** Harm to the integrity of democratic processes – Zero justification:


Resource 3a – Extract CTHGOV Guidance Note: Bill justification

Problem:
Harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory
or local government institutions
Harm:
Misinformation undermining the impartiality of an Australian electoral management body
ahead of an election or a referendum


4 `o` The impartiality of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has not been a

5 consideration in 123 years since Federation,

6 `o` It is unfathomable to foresee impartiality becoming an issue should the AEC maintain

7 the historical levels of dedication and professionalism unless;

8 - **the AEC dramatically alters processes permitted for expediency under recent**

9 **legislative changes to scrutineering, emergency powers afforded the**

10 **Commissioner and questionable provisions in regards to mail in ballots**

11 **(names need not be correct).**

12 - **In which case the public reporting on instances of observable lax**

13 **performance would not qualify as ‘misinformation’.**

14 **b)** Harm to public order or Australian society – Zero justification:


Resource 3b – Extract CTHGOV Guidance Note: Bill justification

Problem:
Disruption of public order or society in Australia
Harm:
Misinformation that encouraged or caused people to vandalise critical communications
infrastructure


15 `o` There is no demonstrable nexus between disruption of public order or Australian

16 society and vandalism of critical infrastructure,

17 `o` Vandalising public or private infrastructure is a prosecutable criminal act with

18 punishments that already act as deterrent,

19 `o` It is inconceivable to foresee firstly for what purpose would a person concoct

20 misinformation and secondly for another to vandalise critical infrastructure with the

21 intention to disrupt Australian society.

22 `o` Vandalism and destruction of Government infrastructure is a crime under robust

23 terrorism laws through which numerous generously funded Government agencies

24 constantly conduct surveillance and monitoring of the Australian people thus

25 essentially negating the threat.

Problem:
Harm to the health of Australians
Harm:
Misinformation that caused people to ingest or inject bleach products to treat a viral infection.


2 `o` There are almost no words to address the absurdity of this justification except to

3 state it is not the responsibility of Government to impose draconian restrictions on

4 the entire Australian population to protect a handful of idiots from themselves,

5 `o` If this did occur without manipulation the numbers would have to be less than 10

6 which is entirely negligible out of a population in excess of 26 million.

7 `o` It is noteworthy whole of Government COVID Intervention has coincided with an

8 increase in excess deaths of over 10% (2022) and Australians dying and thousands

9 damaged, some permanently, by injection of as yet not fully TGA approved

10 experimental pharmaceutical products. Ironically the intervention imposed through

11 hyperventilating Government officials, politicians and regulated corporate / GOV

12 owned media presenters threatening Australians with job losses and crushing social

13 restrictions until injected that given COVID symptoms were nothing more than

14 seasonal influenza with mortality past life expectancy it could reasonably argued the

15 marketing campaign itself constituted 3 years of unending misinformation.

16 **d)** Remaining harms of ‘hate incitement’, irresponsible water usage and questionable trade

17 practices are all covered by existing laws energetically pursued by well-funded

18 Government departments and agencies. – Zero justification.

19 **e)** **SUMMARY STATEMENT 2 – Examination of the justifications for this Bill yielded zero**

20 **imperatives with the flimsiness and lack of anything credible pointing to ulterior as yet**

21 **undisclosed motives by Government.**

2 **does not contravene existing laws through general censorship.**

3 **a)** The structure in place to facilitate Australia’s representative democratic model is that

4 Government relies on implied consent (there is no express consent as per direct

5 democratic models) maintained by keeping Australians informed through Government

6 websites and regulated corporate / GOV owned media. Refer Graphic 1.

7 **b)** Australians in our free society openly discuss and debate important issues affecting

8 them, including Government policy and law, in public places (bars, clubs etc) and on

9 social media. Additionally on social media, Australians privately communicate with family

10 members and close friends.

11 **c)** **SUMMARY STATEMENT 3 – ACMA is a regulatory body primarily focused on**

12 **regulating corporate media through a licensing system to maintain standards and**

13 **adherence to codes and is NOT a suitable agency to censor legitimate discussion**

14 **already policed for security risks by existing well-resourced Government enforcement**

15 **agencies.**

2 **and disinformation by Government in collusion with GOV owned and ACMA regulated**

3 **corporate media, hereafter referred to as ‘GOV coordinated media’, equivalent to the**

4 **effort during the COVID Emergency period (18 March 2020 – 17 April 2022) that has**

5 **been proven beyond reasonable doubt to have caused long term harm to the health**

6 **and wealth of ordinary Australians.**

7 **a)** The greatest peacetime catastrophe to cause harm to Australians was COVID

8 **Intervention imposed through a Government and GOV coordinated media marketing**

9 campaign that clearly met the meaning of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’.

10 - ‘deceptive’ is the most apt descriptor for COVID era information dissemination.

11 - Central to the initial stage of the deceit was politicians, Government officials and

12 Government appointees/contractors speaking hysterically in press conferences and

13 interviews in collusion with an unquestioning GOV coordinated media of a deadly

14 pandemic on now highly discredited modelling contrary to evidence based

15 information published on Government websites and in obscure health

16 documentation about the actual benign effects of the Sars-COV-2 virus. Symptoms of

17 contracting the Sars-COV-2 virus were published by Government alongside those of

18 seasonal cold and flu and with mortality statistics confirming the average age of

19 death fluctuated in the 80’s above life expectancy rendering widespread deaths

20 impossible. A majority of Australians busy with work and family rely on GOV

21 **coordinated media rather than conducting their own research hence gave implied**

22 consent for the devastating COVID Intervention measures largely unaware of the

23 factual material published obscurely by Government.

24 - The second stage of the deceit involved continued omission of the actual effects of

25 the Sars-COV-2 virus as well as a cessation of the deceitful hysterical discussion on

26 the discredited modelling (April 2020). Discussion moved to implying there remained

27 an emergency pandemic by stating the injection into the vast majority of Australians

28 experimental pharmaceutical products not fully approved by the TGA was required

29 NOT to remedy seasonal cold and flu symptoms and prevent deaths of the already

30 frail elderly but to have the brutal COVID Intervention measures lifted. Refer

Measures may include:

-    Minimise cases in the community through ongoing low-level restrictions

-    Lockdowns less likely but possible

-    Ease restrictions on vaccinated residents (TBD)

-    Restore inbound passenger caps at previous levels for unvaccinated returning travellers
and larger caps for vaccinated returning travellers

-    Introduce new reduced quarantine arrangements for vaccinated residents.

2 The serious harm to ordinary Australians caused by misinformation that facilitated the COVID

3 **Intervention by Government in collusion with corporate and GOV owned media** cannot be

4 understated and future occurrences must be prevented as an absolute priority.

5 The motivation for the entirely unnecessary COVID Intervention should be subject to a Royal

6 Commission. It is indisputable the proponents being people in senior positions in Government and

7 the executive, banks, corporate Australia and the medical industry were also the overwhelming

8 beneficiaries in terms of a massive wealth transfer of private and public funds.

9 - $400billion typed into the Exchange Settlement Accounts of banks by the RBA

10 Governor through Quantitative Easing and Term Funding Facility to be repaid from

11 public funds.

12 i. Noteworthy is $188billion (TFF) of the eye watering transfer taken from public

13 funds was lent to banks at 0.1% and 0.25% that is now being lent back to

14 Australians at 6 to 7 % ensuring increased profits on 30 year mortgages etc.

15 - International pharmaceutical companies in receipt of at least $17billion in unwanted

16 experimental products – Annual tenders covering fully approved vaccines averaged

17 at around $130million, quite the increase in profit.

18 - The medical industry in general,

19 i. Aspen Medical received in excess of $1billion for services including a

20 temporary hospital in Canberra that was never needed.

21 ii. Suppliers of PPE much of which has expired and been wasted (over

22 $300million in waste in WA alone).

23 iii. Suppliers of COVID testing kits.

24 - Much of Corporate Australia that remained fully operational during COVID

25 **Intervention while thousands of small to medium businesses were shutdown.**

26 i. Corporate Australia that did closedown had the capital to reopen and

27 benefitted from the demise of many small businesses that did not reopen.

28 Sample of Serious harms to ordinary Australians of COVID Intervention

29 - Pharmaceutical product death and injury (some permanent)

30 `o` It is noted the majority of Australians rejected the products until Corporate Australia

31 in cooperation with Government and a military commander threatened livelihoods.
