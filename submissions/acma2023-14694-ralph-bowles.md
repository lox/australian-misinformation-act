# Comments on the Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation
 Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

As an Australia citizen, I have serious concerns with this draft Bill.

I object to the general principle of the Bill, that our Government or governments are
to be given the role of final arbiters of ‘Truth’ with power to censor and control what
is accessed by citizens.

I object to the general strategy of the Bill, that the best method of dealing with the
search for truth from misinformation is to control the sources of information that
people can access – in other words, to limit their freedom to make their own minds
up.

I am not convinced that the problem of ‘misinformation’ is the way this Bill depicts
it. Specifically, I believe that the Governments of Australia, who are excepted from
the provisions of this proposed legislation, have a track record of being
misinformation spreaders themselves.

I want to address three areas of concern that are noted on the ACMA website
information and the Fact Sheet 1.

_1._ _That misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and well-being of_

_Australians._

_2._ _That misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to our democracy, society and_

_economy._

_3._ _That misinformation (alleged) about Covid has resulted in lower levels of trust in_

_doctors, health officials, and other authoritative sources._

Let me take up these three concerns to challenge the faulty thinking behind this Bill.

  - “Misinformation” is not countered by government censorship or control but

by the free exchange of ideas.

  - The real threat to democracy does not come from citizens that are mistaken

but from authoritarian governments in the thrall of bad ideas or captured by
vested interests.

  - The way to rebuild trust in governments, health officials, and other

authoritative sources is not by draconian and authoritarian censorship but by
freedom, debate, and engagement.

In short, this Bill approaches this issue from the authoritarian political tradition, not
from the liberal freedom tradition behind our institutions.

While the Bill is framed in the language of keeping us all safe (which has ever been
the pretext for government control), there is an iron, authoritarian fist inside that
glove of ‘concern’.

**1.** **What is the Problem of Misinformation?**

In societies there has always been disagreement about truth, ideas, facts,
interpretations, and judgments. Where is the empirical research evidence that a
pluralistic intellectual exchange of views, beliefs, and ideas is harmful to our society?

The best antidote to ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ is the free flow of
information and debate in a truly free public square. This will force everyone who
wants to promote ideas to compete on a level playing field of knowledge, and even
governments cannot rig the game to squelch disagreement with their views.

How often in history has the truth been first proposed by a loner or outsider,
despised by the ‘authorities’ and powers that be, even censored and persecuted,
until finally the truth wins out over government suppression and community
rejection?

In a pluralistic society, now powered by the internet, people can share all sorts of
ideas, knowledge, views, opinions. Much that is shared will be wrong or unpleasant,
but through the democratisation of information exchange, knowledge can get past
powerful entrenched gate-keepers who have vested interests in maintaining their
own version of ‘truth’.

The control of the beliefs and ideas of a society by censorship will not lead to more
truth but will actually prevent the clarification of ideas. Think of Lysenkoism.

The paradox of the emergence of truth through the allowance of discussion and even
incorrect views is lost on the commissars of control that are behind this Bill.
Misinformation is best dealt with by good information. Mistaken views are best
challenged by full and open debate.

I am on the side of John Stuart Mill about how to deal with other ideas that differ
from our own, a.k.a. ‘misinformation’:

“He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His
reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if
he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not
so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either
opinion... Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries
from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by
what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons
who actually believe them...he must know them in their most plausible and
persuasive form.”

We are heirs of long political struggle to win the right to be free of the imposed
control of authoritarian governments.

**2.** **The Real Problem of Misinformation Behind this Bill**

‘Misinformation’ and ‘Disinformation’ have always been with us in societies. Why
then did they start being talked about in the last few years? Fact Sheet 1 points to the
answer. During the Covid years, our Government revoked many of the freedoms of
citizens under the rationale of dealing with an emergency. There was a government
narrative and policies that shut people in homes, forced people out of jobs, damaged
mental health, propagandized a climate of fear, and coerced people to take a medical
treatment that had no long-term safety data. Medical privacy and many other civil
protections went out the window.

Thousands of Australians objected and disagreed with their governments.

But the Governments had a problem. They could control their own media and had
willing colleagues in mainstream media, but social media was a worry. There were
dissenting voices heard on these platforms – not just cranks, but distinguished
scientists and doctors who were otherwise censored.

In many societies like Australia a secret censorship started to be detected on social
media outlets. People knew it was happening, but the agents were hidden from
view.

Then came the Twitter Files, which revealed how the Pharmaceutical and
advertising industries, in alliance with their friends in the U.S. government, had
been working behind the scenes to suppress and censor the open forum of social
media. This has been called the Censorship Industrial Complex.

The freeing up of some social media, so that people could get a second opinion from
that of the government and mainstream media, posed a big problem for the forces of
authoritarian control of the narrative.

Now this is where your draft Bill comes from: a clever strategy to take back control
of the narrative, to make sure that Australians don’t hear what the government
doesn’t want them to know.

The new strategy from the Commonwealth is to combat free and open
communication by threatening draconian fines on social media platforms and even
proposing to call individuals in for some interrogation and intimidation. This whole
Bill has an Iron Curtain feel to it.

This draft Bill looks like another attempt to get control back for political and
industry interests, this time by penalising the platforms by legalized censorship.

This Bill claims to be about rebuilding trust in our institutions and authorities. This
brings me to the question of why the Government has the right to claim our trust.

The last few years have demonstrated how unworthy of the role of censor are our
governments. During the Covid years, the governments of Australia were the
Godzillas of misinformation, issuing edicts that soon were revealed to be incorrect,
and using their power to inflict coercive and harmful regulations on the population.

The Covid 19 vaccines have caused a huge number of serious adverse effects, and
the excess deaths of Australians began to rise with the roll-out – but you won’t hear
this correlation on the mainstream news or from government health officials.

Why should I trust this Federal Government? Through their agency the Therapeutic
Goods Administration, the government has an immense conflict of interest between
their duty towards citizens and their entanglement with the Pharmaceutical
industry, which almost totally funds the TGA that regulates the industry.

The same Pharmaceutical industry is one of, if not the biggest, sponsor of
mainstream news media. No surprise then that the problems with the coerced and
rushed Covid vaccines are only now being discovered by many citizens. It was only
through social media, in the free exchange of ideas, that world-leading scientists

could voice their alarm and escape the censoring of government and their allies in
corporate media.

It is not surprising that the terms ‘misinformation and disinformation are now rising
in use. They are buzz words used by governments that want to suppress sources of
information that threaten their power or the influence of their business allies. Dissent
is now called ‘misinformation’ and labelled dangerous.

This Bill sets up a censorship culture where the Government monitors the narrative.
This is the classic profile of totalitarian and authoritarian polities. The Bill indirectly
controls the expression of beliefs by punishing platforms, but it also envisages a
system of tribunals that can call citizens to account for their beliefs.

This Bill exempts governments from its scope, but there is a strong case that
Australian governments have been guilty of repeated misinformation and maybe
disinformation. It gives them coercive control over the narrative that may challenge
them or point out that the Emperor has no clothes.

If the Commonwealth Government is concerned about people not trusting them,
then it should hold a Royal Commission about how the governments responded to
Covid 19 pandemic. It should open up the channels of discussion and allow freedom
of discourse.

**Conclusion**

Is Australia a pluralistic society where there are many different views and beliefs or
is the government to be the arbiter of ‘Truth’?

Citizens of Australia do not need the Government to tell them what to believe or
what views to hold, or how to sort out truth from error. In a free society we can
make up our own minds, and we will be helped by hearing a range of views. It is
always good to get a second opinion, despite what this Government says.

It is a good thing that we can disagree and have different views, even to the
government’s policies and views.

This proposed Bill is a brazen and shocking attempt to curtail the free expression
and sharing of ideas, and to impose a government censorship regime. It has no place
in a free, pluralistic and democratic society. The Albanese Government should be
ashamed of itself for bringing it forward.

The government that can police information can thereby control information and
squash discussion that displeases them and challenges their ‘truth’ (ie. their
narrative).

This Bill is Orwellian. It has been said that ‘misinformation is the word they use to
shut you up.’

Please throw this Bill into the garbage can where it belongs.
