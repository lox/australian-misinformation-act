    "Notable Quotes": [
      "This bill is nothing other than a poorly concealed effort to shut down and control any voices that would otherwise unveil the lies, propaganda, and manipulations of the state and its various apparatus of control.",
      "The censorship regime that will be effectuated by the powers in this Bill will prevent the public from alerting their fellow members of the community to valid information that may not yet be known to the state and its agents.",
      "This is an ill-conceived bill whose primary purpose is to establish a ‘ministry of truth’ that will ensure that no opposing voices to the political apparatus can utilise public spaces or any other effective digital communications platform to speak."
