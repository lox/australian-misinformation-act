RE: COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT

I’m writing to voice my absolute objection to the proposed bill as noted above.

If there is one thing that is essential to a democracy it is free speech. There is no doubt that so called
“Misinformation” & “Disinformation” are prevalent, this is to be expected and history has shown us that
information from both the public and governments fall into this category. So why would the public
accept a bill that allows governments and councils along with government funded media to be exempt
from this legislation? We don’t!

All censorship will do is breed greater distrust of our government by the people. Free speech, even if
against your own beliefs, is part of a healthy discussion. No single person, government, or organization is
always correct, so through free and uncensored speech or media we can use our own discernment and
intuition to make our own choices. There is no place for government in dictating what we can and can’t
say, read, or believe. There is no doubt that a miniscule percentage of incorrect information may be
taken by some to be true and potentially acted upon in a damaging manner, but the vast majority of
Australians would not. Nothing is more dangerous than the abuse of power by government. This whole
bill is far overreaching, and I'm actually appalled by the proposal.

Article 19 of the universal Declaration of Human Rights of which Australians played a part in creating
states:

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers.

This proposed bill in its current state does not conform with this article and is need of abolishment or
major amendment.

Yours faithfully
