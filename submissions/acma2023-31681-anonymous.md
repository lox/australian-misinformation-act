Thank you for this opportunity to make comment to this bill as an Australian citizen.

Below are my arguments that I wish to raise against legislation proposed by the Labor Party aimed at
regulating misinformation and disinformation.

**Freedom of Speech Concerns: My view of the legislation is that regulating misinformation and**
disinformation could infringe upon freedom of speech rights. They may contend that defining and
identifying misinformation can be subjective, potentially leading to the suppression of legitimate and
differing viewpoints.

**Selective Enforcement: Governments could use the regulation as a tool to silence political opponents**
or viewpoints that they disagree with for example “Exclusions” page 5, it is noted that “Professional
News Content” is to be excluded from this bill. They are still regulated which I understand, however,
in this new age of information sharing they too should be held accountable for “Misinformation and
Disinformation” set by any department which would include ACMA. The reason being is across the
globe we see one central influence that time and time again directs attention, this being economy, or
more frank terms “Money”. This of course equals power and the more power given to one central
corporation, institution or individual the more we see genuine freedoms removed. Simple examples
of this include the sugar industry which once was tainted as “Healthy” and the cigarette industry,
which now is very heavily linked to cancer.

**Chilling Effect on Political Discourse: My argument that strict regulation of misinformation and**
disinformation could have a chilling effect on political discourse. Look now with the VOICE to
Parliament, Individuals and organizations have become hesitant to engage in public debates or
discussions for fear of inadvertently running afoul of the Government narrative. Sky Channel and the
IPA have disclosed Labor’s dishonesty with what was previously said about Treaty, and the backlash
received from Government is disingenuous, Facebook have limited posts from IPA on these current
issues even though are factually correct.

**Potential for Abuse: I have concerns about the potential for the legislation to be abused for political**
purposes. The Labor Party, as the proposer of the bill, could exploit the regulations to suppress
criticism or dissent against their policies and actions.

POWER! It needs to be brought to the attention that providing this level of power to “The Minister”
could undermine the freedom of speech we still enjoy in Australia. This found on page 11 spells the
possibility of such being given the authority to silence a digital platform basically through his or her
opinion under the banner of “adequate protection for the community” is something that needs
heavy consideration when debating this bill. What could be seen as “satire” by some, but perhaps
something more by a minister leaves the door wide open. A single opinion without any consultation
is not democracy. This is also covered on page 9 and page 11 when it comes to “Digital Service”
which the minister could also determine as per Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. Open provisions of power unregulated
handed over to a single person given ministerial privilege not only to restrict, but to provide
exclusions to ones he or she sees fit.

**Impact on Media Freedom: Critics may argue that the legislation could negatively impact media**
freedom and investigative journalism. They might suggest that the threat of legal consequences for

publishing potentially misleading information could deter journalists from pursuing important stories
or exposing corruption.

**Enforcement Challenges: Sceptics might argue that effectively enforcing such legislation could be**
extremely challenging. They could point to the difficulty in distinguishing between genuine
misinformation, honest mistakes, and deliberate disinformation campaigns.

**Unintended Consequences: There's a concern that attempts to regulate misinformation and**
disinformation could lead to unintended consequences, such as driving such content underground,
making it harder to track and counteract. On page 53 it is noted that “Will readily accommodate
technological change” and “Encourages the development of technologies relating to digital platform
services”. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the reason we are having this bill is due to the evolution of
technology, isn’t it? So how does encouraging more technology going to fix the issue? Let’s face it,
95% of all social media and fact checkers are going to be from overseas, and they do not have
Australia’s best interest.

**Innovation and Technology Challenges: Many contend that lawmakers, including the Labor Party, do**
not fully understand the rapidly evolving landscape of digital communication and social media
platforms. This could lead to ineffective or outdated regulations that fail to address the root causes
of misinformation and disinformation.

**Global Nature of the Internet: Given the global nature of the internet, I question the effectiveness of**
national-level regulation in addressing a problem that transcends borders.

Emerging circumstances. 50. - This is what we can see perhaps a “what if” things are not evolving to
plan. This clause appears to open up the availability for swift action if things are getting out of hand.
Question is, what would this be used for? Where a minister appears to be given extra powers, so
would ACMA. Where would that decision come from? Say the public are frustrated with things and
putting forward these frustrations across social media where they do have somewhat have a voice,
who is to make that decision? Does it remain in Australia, or does it extend to a global organization
such as the United Nations? Would the UN (and its affiliates) influence misinformation and
disinformation if this bill is passed? Information has been left out here which needs to be addressed.
If the topic in question is good for social media one day, but not once either the government in
power or the organization attempting to change international law outside of Australia, but the
citizens of Australia disagree.

“Fact Checking” - On page 30, we see the wording of “supporting fact checking” but there is no other
context to this. We cannot just restrict people’s expression just because someone or organization
disagree with them. Our future generations deserve the right to question things no matter where
they come from, mainly due to blunders listed earlier on sugar and cigarettes. Other concerning
points related to this part of the bill include “using technology to prevent or respond to
misinformation or disinformation on digital platform services”. We have already understood that
Artificial Intelligence has its issues and needs to be monitored. Relying on technology to monitor
discussion will be subject to the input of that system from the introduction of such a thing all for the
sake of convenience and quite frank laziness. Any restriction put on these social media giants or
monetary fines will be passed onto the third-party fact checking organizations, while our freedom of
expression is compromised. Clarity needs to be addressed here, for example ACMA intends to
publish “misinformation or disinformation on digital platform services” (Page 26). Who is to decide
what becomes misinformation or disinformation outside the minister involved? Are we relying on
technology and employed “fact checkers” to decide?
