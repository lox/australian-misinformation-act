I object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 and it's attempt to censor free-thought & free-speech on
Australian Internet social media sites.

A single point of view is dangerous. That it cannot be questioned is a sign of radical tyranny.

I object to unelected & unknown individuals at ACMA determining what is 'misinformation'
& 'disinformation', and that differences from their unaccountable opinions will be subject to
costly legal action. This is an Orwellian bill and will have a chilling effect on free political
debate in Australia and could even lead to an authoritarian state without any effective
opposition (similar to various Communist regimes). Debate is essential to democracy and the
right to protest is fundamental.

It is insightful to see that the Federal government has explicitly excluded itself from the
provisions of the bill (thus demonstrating its understanding of the negative effects it would
have on free-speech in parliament). In other words, the instigators of the bill want to take
away the public's right to free debate, whilst retaining it for themselves. Power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely. This bill is anti-Australia. It is unacceptable in any free
democratic society and it would be detrimental to robust, healthy Australia.

It's time to stand for personal liberty and freedom of speech. Debate and an enquiring mind
are essential components to development and without them, society and the people within
that society become stagnant, living under an oppressive regime with diminished quality of
life of the people subjected to tyrannical controls.

Stop the censorship. Stop cancel culture. Stop the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
