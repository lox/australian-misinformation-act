Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’.

The internet can be used to promote all kinds of information, some of which is clearly untrue. However, the answer is
not to make the government the arbiter of truth and certainly not to censor those it disagrees with. The answer is open
and honest debate.

It is every Australians right to freedom of speech and conscience. The proposed bill will remove freedom of speech
and conscience.

This bill represents complete government overreach and authoritarianism.

I strongly reject the proposed "Misinformation Bill".
