**“MISINFORMATION”**

Legislation intended to eliminate “Misinformation” must first establish what is “Correct” information.
Second, who has the ability to satisfy this criteria for everyone must also be determined?

Establishing what is correct, traditionally is a process of common sense for most. Apart from our innate
sense of gullibility or alternatively, paranoia, assessing the right balance of the correctness of any given
information is not an impossible exercise for most.

If social networks allow manipulation through 'selective disclosure' of information, then that loophole
rightly ought to be addressed, but only so far as the social networks involved are concerned, rather than
using the scatter gun solution of limiting free speech to everyone.

**“DISINFORMATION"**

Any Legislation seeking to control “Disinformation” must, by definition, first be able to establish that the
given information is false. Who exactly satisfies this criteria for everyone is the puzzling mystery?

However, if any information is ultimately proven to be false it must also be established if the error was
deliberately propagated to deceive.

The killer where the critical legislation of “Information” is concerned, is the certain detrimental effect it will
have on free speech.

Policing such legislation, besides creating an expensive legal nightmare, would likely prevent many
ordinary people from speaking out where they rightly should be able to express their views, no matter how
inadequately they may be equipped to do so.

The last piece of legislation that ever should be enacted in this country, is law that prevents any free flow
of any individual's most cherished thoughts and their ability to publicly express them.

That is what Free Speech means in a democratic society. It is our most prized possession!
