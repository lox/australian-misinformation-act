I wish to submit a protest of Government censorship on social media as follows:

 - Australians live in a democracy where the people have the freedom of speech
and thought, and Government should be protecting these freedoms not
suppressing them.

 - This Bill undermines democracy and will stop debate or opinion.

 - I object and protest that Australian Government Bill to label any truth telling or
opinion/debate as misinformation and disinformation is something I would
expect in Communist China not in Australia.

 - Limited speech is far more dangerous to society than the consequences of false
claims.

 - Putting social media in charge of misinformation/disinformation censorship is
an open invitation to a one-sided opinion on their ‘truth’ which may not actual
truth. Example: during all information re: COVID was censored and controlled
by Government ‘experts’ to suit their own narrative, and medical experts in the
field of infectious disease nor scientise all were censored and silenced – just
like the Chinese Government in China.

 - Freedom of speech is enshrined in the universal declaration of Human Rights!
