## New ACMA powers to combat ‘misinformation and disinformation’ 


## Submission on exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 SUBMISSION.

# “

## Article 19 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

I am most perplexed by the actions of those in crafting this legislation and

advocating for these ideas. It appears that their decisions, influenced by financial
incentives, may have negative consequences not only for others by also for
themselves. This legislation has significant implications for life in Australia and those
who contribute to its creation will inevitably be bound by the limitations it imposes.
It is important to recognise the potential long-term effect of such legislation, as they
may result in silencing not only the present but also future generations.

## Lobbying.

# “

## Lobbying means any attempt to influence the decision-making of a government or opposition representative in the exercise of their official functions on behalf of a third party, for a fee or other reward.

Lobbying has become the crack in democracy, opening the door for

conflicts of interest, corruption, and compromised individuals to influence
policy-making. Lobbying allows powerful interests to exert undue influence on
decision-makers, often to advance their own agendas at the expense of the public
good.

We must contribute as ordinary taxpayers, but lobbyists, acting as

intermediaries for corporations or special interest groups, wield significant influence
by financially supporting politicians who deliver on their set objectives, which
prioritise corporate power and profits. This disconnect undermines democracy,
exacerbating the gap between political interests and the welfare of the people they
are meant to serve.

This proposed legislation has made its way to Australia through this crack.

This legislation silences debate—silencing any opposition to the atrocities and
human rights violations committed and about to committed upon the Australian
population to meet the demands of lobbying giants, the UN, the WEF, the WHO
and their pharmaceutical partners who wish to advance their goals unchallenged.

Currently, 178 Nations are being led into a dark and inhumane future led by

these organisations and masters of the manipulation of language. This future
includes the sexualisation of children, citizen capture through the Digital ID, CBDC,
surveillance and smart cities to name a few, in order to secure complete power and
control over populations.

We need more debate on these, any many more alarming issues, not more

censorship in order to protect Australians from these lobbying giants and their dark
minds.

## Democracy.

Examining democratic principles is crucial as they form the foundation of a

just society. Democracy ensures political equality, empowers citizens to participate
in decision-making, protects individual rights and freedoms, embraces diversity and
pluralism, promotes transparency and accountability, and upholds the rule of law.

By understanding and upholding these principles, we can foster a society

that respects human rights, ensures representation and participation, encourages
open dialogue, and safeguards against abuses of power. Examining democratic
principles allows us to critically assess the fairness, legitimacy, and effectiveness of
laws, policies, and institutions, ensuring that our societies continue to thrive as
democratic countries.

## Democracy is a form of government in which power is vested on the people, who exercise it either directly or through elected representatives. It is a system that emphasises the principals of political equality, majority rule and protection of individual rights and freedoms. In a democratic society, citizens have the right to participate in decision-making processes, express their opinions and hold their government accountable. 
 Democracy ensures that citizens have the right to participate in the political process, including the ability to vote in free and fair elections and engage in peaceful protests or demonstrations. It upholds individual rights and freedoms, safeguarding principals like freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and the press. Democracy values diversity, fostering a society where different perspectives, beliefs and interests are included, allowing for open expression and debate.
 It allows for a pluralistic society where various opinions and ideas can be freely expressed and debated, whether in person or online.

In a democracy, the people serve as the vital checks and balances that hold

our government accountable. A government with the power to censor its critics
risks escaping scrutiny and accountability for any potential wrongdoing.
Throughout history, instances of government censorship have been associated with
abuses of power and the suppression of opposing voices. When authorities control
information and limit free expression, the potential for atrocity and corruption
becomes pervasive.

A healthy and thriving democracy depends on the collective power of its

citizens to question, challenge, and hold those in power accountable. Looking
back at history, we find that those who engaged in censorship were rarely on the
right side of justice. Protecting the right to oppose and preserving free expression is
crucial to ensuring transparency, preventing abuses, and upholding the principles
that underpin a fair and just society.

Democracy thrives on the principles of government accountability and

transparency, ensuring that public officials remain answerable to the people. It
fosters freedom through oversight, checks and balances, and the right to access
information, all aimed at preventing abuses of power and corruption. However,
this proposed legislation, which concentrates power, shuts down democracy and
accountability. This legislation seeks to consolidate authority, it threatens to
undermine the democratic process, impeding our ability to hold those in power
accountable and diminishing the core values that uphold a democracy.

This legislation hinders the democratic right of questioning, seeking

alternative perspectives, and holding the government accountable when doubts
arise or information feels inconsistent. The ability to critically examine, validate, and
challenge government actions and narratives is vital for upholding democratic
principles. It ensures transparency, encourages robust public discourse, and helps
prevent the consolidation of power. Restricting the ability to question and seek
alternative perspectives risks undermining the democratic process and inhibiting
the public's ability to hold those in power accountable.

## The Manipulation of Language.

Lobbying giants have misleadingly influenced perspectives around this

legislation by portraying it as a measure to protect public safety. By using fear
tactics and appealing to people's concerns about safety and well-being, they seek
to manipulate the public mindset and divert attention from the broader
implications for democracy.


-----

Under the guise of safeguarding the public, they obscure the fact that this

legislation may curtail free expression, limit access to diverse information, and
grant excessive and consolidated powers to control the flow of information.

The misleading portrayal conceals the erosion of democracy, allowing

lobbyists to advance their interests while veiling the true impact on individual rights,
transparency, and democratic accountability. Being vigilant and critically examining
the legislation is essential to see through these manipulative tactics and preserve
the core principles of democracy.

## “Misinformation" and "Disinformation.”

This is not merely about silencing opposition; it is about suppressing

objections to egregious acts. This involves men undergoing medical treatments to
chemically ‘chest feed’ and potentially harm infants, dismembering a child in the
womb up to the point of birth, performing castrations on children without parental
consent, and jailing parents who object as per the legislation already enacted in
Melbourne.

These atrocities are the distressing realities that are steering us towards a

previously unthinkable darkness, led by individuals with the sickest of minds.
Tragically, our complicity in these crimes against humanity cannot be ignored, and
it is imperative that we confront and address these issues to protect the values that
define us as human beings.

The objective here is clear: to silence individuals with a conscience that

are speaking out. Industry experts are witnessing misleading data being presented
to the public, while young adults share their stories of regretting being allowed to
transition genders at a young and impressionable age. Those who have suffered
vaccine injuries are also silenced.

These voices are not misinformation; rather, they represent inconvenient

truths challenging those seeking to manipulate information to control public
opinions. The attempt to suppress these voices underscores a concerning need to
control perspectives and limit access to diverse points of view, ultimately affecting
the beliefs and choices of the masses to increase power and control of these
sickly minded lobbyists.

The act of silencing opposition is deeply concerning and presents a grave

threat to the principles of democracy and human rights. This legislation stifles
objecting to these atrocities, and critical issues are brushed aside and genuine


-----

concerns are dismissed. The disregard for parental consent, the pursuit of extreme
measures without regard for human dignity, and the absence of open debate on
critical matters raises serious ethical and moral questions.

The lack of accountability and transparency of these actions casts a shadow

on the democratic process and the protection of basic human rights. As we move
forward, it is crucial to acknowledge our role in addressing these issues, for turning
a blind eye or remaining complacent makes us complicit. It is our collective
responsibility to speak out against this disastrous legislation.

## Masters of Manipulation.

The use of the terms "misinformation" and "disinformation" are manipulative

when their true intent is to obscure inconvenient truths. These labels are often
wielded to discredit these opposing voices or alternative viewpoints that
challenge the prevailing narrative. By labelling information as false or misleading,
those in power can avoid addressing facts and maintain control over the narrative.

In reality, genuine information may be portrayed as misinformation to

dissuade public scrutiny and discourage critical thinking. This manipulation of
language erodes trust in the flow of information and threatens the very essence of
open and honest discourse in a democratic society. It is essential to be vigilant
against such tactics and ensure that the pursuit of truth remains at the heart of
public discourse.

## What is Truth?

Truth is not a static concept; it emerges through the contestation of ideas

and free debate. In a dynamic and democratic society, truth is discovered through
the collision of diverse perspectives, the exchange of knowledge, and the
challenge of assumptions. Through open dialogue and respectful discourse, ideas
are tested, refined, and validated, leading to a deeper understanding of complex
issues.

Embracing the richness of different viewpoints fosters a culture of critical

thinking, intellectual growth, and a continuous quest for truth. It is through the
freedom to debate, questioning, and exploring that society advances its
understanding and reaches closer to the ever-evolving truth.


-----

Silencing this process is inherently anti-democratic, as it obstructs the very

essence of democracy—freedom of expression, and the right to engage in
respectful debate and disagreement. Embracing and valuing the plurality of
opinions nurtures a society that upholds democracy and a person’s fundamental
right to decide what is true.

Protecting the space for genuine debate is essential to preserving the

integrity of democratic discourse and cultivating a society that thrives on the
pursuit of truth through the collective power of ideas.

## Facts and Politics.

The banning of facts solely based on political convenience has already been

a concerning trend that undermines the principles of democracy. When posts
containing accurate information are censored or restricted due to their mismatch
with a particular political agenda, it jeopardizes the credibility of the information
dissemination process.

Over time, many posts that were banned have been proven to be entirely

factual, highlighting the manipulation and the suppression of inconvenient truths.
Such actions raise serious questions about the extent to which political motivations
will influence the access to accurate information. Promoting open discourse is
essential to ensuring an informed and democratic society where truth prevails over
political agendas.

## Governments Dictating Truth.

The notion of the government determining absolute truth and coercing

digital giants to adhere to it raises concerns about the erosion of democracy. In a
democratic society, the pursuit of truth is an essential function of open debate
and free expression. However, giving the government unchecked authority to
dictate what constitutes truth undermines the diverse perspectives and critical
thinking that forms the basis of a democracy.

Such a path leads to a dangerous outcome where citizens are forced to

accept a singular version of truth, stifling independent thought and inquiry. This risk
of facing repercussions for expressing opposing views could ultimately limit
intellectual freedom and hinder the democratic process. Preserving a healthy
democracy requires maintaining space for robust debate and allowing citizens to


-----

weigh multiple perspectives, enabling them to make informed decisions and
uphold the principles of democratic discourse.

This path leads us into to a dangerous future where the freedom to believe

and think independently becomes restricted. With attempts to control
information and stifle opposing views, individuals may find themselves in jeopardy
merely for expressing different perspectives or questioning prevailing narratives. A
society where critical thinking is discouraged, and diversity of thought is suppressed
threatens to erode the very foundations of democracy.

This legislation undermines democratic principles such as political equality,

individual rights and freedoms, diversity, and accountability. Its potential to grant
the government unchecked authority over information dissemination raises
concerns about its impact on democratic processes and the free exchange of ideas.

Without the ability to freely believe and think, the essence of an open and

democratic society becomes at risk, and the danger of sliding into an oppressive
reality looms. Vigilance in preserving freedom of thought and expression is
essential to prevent such a chilling future.

## The Dangers of the Paradox. 

 The Australian Government to Exclude Itself and Its Partners from Promoting Misinformation and Disinformation that the Government Itself Defines.

Excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the
following:
(b) professional news content;
(c) content produced by or for an educational institution
accredited by any of the following:
(i) the Commonwealth;
(ii) a State;
(iii) a Territory;
(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a
Territory as an accreditor of educational institutions;
(d) content produced by or for an educational institution
accredited:
(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a
foreign government as an accreditor of educational


-----

institutions; and
(il) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable
Australian educational institution;
(e) content that is authorised by:
(i) the Commonwealth; or
(i) a State; or

This legislation raises concerns by potentially allowing the government to

selectively determine what qualifies as misinformation, leading to potential
censorship or suppression of opposing voices. This raises significant concerns
about its compatibility with democratic principles.

By the Government excluding itself and its partners, the news media and

educational institutions, from the regulations and at the same time allowing itself
to define what qualifies as misinformation is paradoxical. It undermines the core
tenets of democracy, such as accountability, transparency, and equal treatment
under the law.

The government granting itself the authority to determine what content is

exempted from regulation creates a power imbalance and huge potential threat
for abuse, as it enables the government to control the narrative, manipulate public
opinion, and suppress opposing voices. In a democratic society, it is crucial for
legislation to be fair, impartial, and subject to checks and balances to ensure the
protection of individual.

By exempting its own content, the government gains the authority to define

and spread what it deems misinformation without being subject to the same
regulations and scrutiny. This creates a power imbalance and undermines
principles of accountability and transparency. The exemption raises fears of
political manipulation, narrative control, and suppression of opposing views.

Democracy relies on the free flow of information, diverse perspectives, and

open debate. When a self-regulatory body assumes the authority to determine
the veracity of information, there is a potential risk to freedom of speech and the
pluralistic nature of democratic societies.

A self-regulatory body with significant powers to determine truth may

concentrate too much authority in one entity, stifling opposing voices or
alternative viewpoints. Restricting the ability to question and seek alternative
perspectives risks undermining the democratic process and inhibiting the public's
ability to hold those in power accountable.

## We have been warned.

# “

## Something like 1 9 8 4 could actually happen, this is the direction that the world is going in at the present time…. There will be no loyalty except loyalty to the party, but always there will be the intoxication of power… If you want a picture of the future, imaging a boot stamping on human face forever. The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one, don’t let it happen, it depends on you.
 George Or well’s final warning of his terrifying masterpiece,  1 9 8 4

The moral drawn from this dangerous nightmare scenario is clear – we

must not let it happen. The responsibility to safeguard democracy lies with each
one of us to protect the core values that define us as free individuals. The future's
fate depends on our collective determination to defend and uphold the principles
of democracy, ensuring that the intoxication of power does not dictate our destiny.

Once we allow this level of control to be exerted over the people, we risk a

bleak future where freedom and our fundamental rights will be lost forever. Once
this legislation is in place, there will be no way to escape it, making it imperative
that we take action to prevent its implementation. Once such controls over
information and speech are enabled, it permanently stifles opposition and hinders
the free flow of ideas, dissolving democracy.

Preserving democratic principles and safeguarding freedom of expression is

essential to avoid falling into a situation where opposing voices are silenced, and
critical thinking is curtailed. It is our responsibility to uphold the values that define
democracy and prevent the entrenchment of a system that inhibits our ability to
question, debate, and hold those in power accountable.


-----

## The End of Democracy?

These very act of composing this legislation does not reflect the actions of a

democratic government; instead, they resemble those of a regime seeking to exert
control over information, opinions, and data. Industry experts and reputable leaders
in the field are being labelled incorrect as they courageously expose the truth. This
becomes a major concern for manipulative lobbyists with insidious agendas.

These tactics employed to suppress opposing views and muzzle the truth are

characteristic of regimes rather than democratic entities, and it is crucial to be
vigilant against such efforts to protect the essence of democracy and safeguard the
integrity of open discourse to prevent the abuse of power.

Some examples of countries that have implemented or proposed measures

targeting online content and information control include China, Russia, Iran, North
Korea, and Vietnam. These countries have been known to restrict freedom of
speech, censor opposing voices, and exert control over online platforms to shape
narratives and maintain political control.

Legislation that belongs to non-democratic countries has no place in

Australia, a country founded on democratic principles and values. Australia upholds
the fundamental rights of its citizens, including freedom of speech, freedom of the
press, and the right to access diverse sources of information.

Importing legislation from non-democratic countries would be inconsistent

with the democratic fabric of Australian society. It is essential to maintain the
integrity of democratic institutions, protect individual liberties, and foster an
environment that encourages open dialogue, diverse perspectives, and
accountability. Any proposed legislation should align with democratic principles,
ensuring that Australia remains a beacon of democracy and upholds the rights and
freedoms of its people.

## A Grim Future.

“Our objective is not to win a debate; our objective is to come to power. A
new concept of warfare is conquering a country from within. You conquer a
country by capturing the organisation that operates inside the country, then
they will like us, then they will support us, then we become their leaders, then
we can betray them. We don’t have to win debates then, because if anyone
disagrees with us, we (remove) them.”


-----

The grim reality we now face is manipulation of the very institutions that

uphold democracy in this country. The objective is not to engage in meaningful
debate but to seize power through deception and control. By infiltrating and coopting organisations and our government from within, the aim is to gain support
and trust, only to betray those who believed in the cause.

Opposing views are being stifled, and opposition is systematically removed

through this legislation, allowing a manipulative agenda to advance unchallenged.
Such a reality is deeply troubling as it plays out in our reality. Vigilance and a
commitment to upholding democratic values are crucial to safeguard against such
nefarious schemes and preserve the true essence of democracy.

## Conclusion.

In any democracy that relies on open debate to hold its government

accountable to its citizens, censorship has no place. Deliberately hindering this
process should raise red flags, as history has shown and predictive novels have
warned about the dangers of such actions. Preserving the space for free and robust
discourse is essential to safeguarding democratic values and ensuring the active
participation of the people in shaping their society's future.

We are facing a grim reality of our own making, where our actions are

leading us to our own detriment. By allowing measures that stifle opposing views,
restrict information, and erode democratic values, we are effectively undermining
our own freedom and well-being. Instead of fostering an environment of open
dialogue and accountability, we are paving the way for a society where critical
perspectives are suppressed, and individual liberties are compromised. It is crucial
to recognise this perilous path we are on and work collectively to ensure that we
protect and preserve the principles that have long defined us as free and
democratic beings.

In conclusion, the proposed legislation represents a fundamental departure from
democratic principles. It raises significant concerns regarding the potential for
misuse, as it grants the government unchecked authority to define truth and
establish itself as a self-regulatory body controlling information and narratives to
mitigate accountability. A government with the power to censor its critics risks
escaping scrutiny and accountability. Such an imbalance of power poses a
substantial risk of limiting access to diverse perspectives and stifling the pursuit of
truth to consolidate political control. Preserving the essence of democracy requires
us all to play our role in upholding the right to free expression, enabling citizens to
engage in robust debates, preventing abuses of power and corruption, ensuring
that public officials remain accountable to the people.
