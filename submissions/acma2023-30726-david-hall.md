Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the

_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and_

_Disinformation) Bill 2023)_

I totally oppose the proposed new powers, or any power that would limit freedom of

speech.

It is obvious since the Covid 19 pandemic that our Constitutionally guaranteed rights

to free speech, to choose what medicine (or experimental medicine) we may or may

not want in our bodies, and our ability to have freedom of movement and freedom

within our careers, has been restricted. It is also obvious that all, or most of, the laws

and restrictions that were put in place had no positive impact on the control of the

disease. This is clear from the outcomes experienced by countries like Sweden and

groups like the Amish who didn’t impose such draconian and intrusive measures or

didn’t partake of the vaccinations.

The Commonwealth now wants to take things a step further and to determine what

we can and cannot say by holding the social media platforms accountable for

freedom of speech.

The so called ‘fact checkers’ at the social media platforms were proven not to check

facts during the Covid pandemic, but to instead just enforce the opinion of their

masters. This is totally unacceptable. They actually blocked access to websites like

www.c19vaxreactions.com which contain factual information, because it didn’t agree

with the narrative of Governments. They have proven themselves to not be impartial.

Who makes the decision as to what is misinformation anyway? Many things that

were thought to be misinformation have turned out to be proven to be true over time.

People once thought the earth was flat.

Australia already has laws in place to protect people from hate speech or threats, so

we do not need to introduce these new powers.

I also believe there is too much potential for corruption due to the ability of big

businesses, like pharmaceutical companies, to influence media and individuals so

that we end up with only ‘information’ that is approved of by the people that hold the

money and therefore the power.

Sincerely
