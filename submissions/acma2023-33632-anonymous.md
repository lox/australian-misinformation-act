Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA)

Dear ACMA,

We write in response to ACMA's request for feedback on the proposed Communications

Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

The Universal declaration of human rights proclaims that all human beings are born FREE

and EQUAL in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all rights and freedom set
## out, so with that statement passing this bill of 'Combatting misinformation and disinformation' goes against all human rights for free speech.

God gave us FREE WILL- free to think for ourselves and free to stand up for what we believe

is right. No one            - not a single person, a Corporate Government, or one of their departments

can silence anyone who wish to express their own opinions, if what they say is untrue, it is

up to the wider community to decide if it is right or wrong.

Free speech in a democratic society is our RIGHT!

It is obvious to all that Western Governments are parroting from the same propaganda at
## the same time, by the unelected UN, WHO, WEF and Global Cabal, ordering our government

on how to suppress and punish their citizens.

We don't want a one world government!

If this bill is passed this will be a downhill path to Fascism and Dictatorship.

The amendments to this bill should be discarded in its entirety.

Regards
