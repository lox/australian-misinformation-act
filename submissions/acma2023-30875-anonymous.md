**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**
**2023: Exposure Draft Feedback**

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the exposure draft of the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, which was
requested of the public on 24th June 2023.

I’d first like to say I’m writing this as a concerned citizen, and the views outlined in my submission
are entirely my own and I share no affiliation with any organisation.

In my submission, I will focus on the following problematic aspects of the bill as I see them: 
a) **Determining what is the truth - The Australian Federal Government determining what is**

truthful information on digital platforms.

b) **Legalisation of the truth - Any information not aligning to the government’s determination**

of truthful on digital platforms will be deemed illegal.

c) **Exemptions - Australian Governments, and government recognised media outlets**

(professional news content) will be the only entities exempt from this law.

d) **Responsibility for Enforcing the law - The responsibility of the monitoring and censorship of**

information is to be outsourced to the digital platforms themselves.

e) **The Scope - The new laws would apply to a broad range of ‘platforms’ including search**

engines, news aggregators, social media and podcast services

**Is there a Problem that need fixing?**
First, we should ask ourselves the question, is there an existing problem for the Australian people
that this law seeks to address and if so, how much of a problem is it?

This law is primarily targeting social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter.

So, how serious of a problem is misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms for
the Australian people?

According to Edelman, a global communications firm who study influence of trust across society,
stated in their annual “Trust Barometer” 2023 titled “Australia on a Path to Polarisation: Edelman’s
_Trust Barometer 2023”_

In the section: 
_“In Australia, No News Source Trusted” (page 15)_

**_Social Media’s trustworthiness is only 25%._**

So, this law seeks to address potentially un warranted trust in social media by curtailing freedom of
expression and speech for every Australian on a digital platform, despite 63% of the Australian
population already not trusting Social Media.

Based on this alone, it appears that the vast majority of Australians already successfully deal with
this issue without the need for government intervention or involvement.

This is how a mature free country operates.

So again, is there an existing problem with misinformation and disinformation on the social media
platforms for the Australian People? It doesn’t look like it, as the Australian public seems to be
astute in determining misinformation and disinformation already.

In Edelman’s Trust Barometer 2022, it cited –

**“A majority of Australians (55%) say their default tendency is to distrust**
**_something until they see evidence it is trustworthy.”_**

https://www.edelman.com.au/trust-barometer-2022-australia

This is also how Australia’s judicial system works, by evaluating all available evidence (not just one
view) before making a judgement.

The Australian people should be afforded this same right.

**Legalising what is the truth (with exemptions for some)**

I believe that in a free country, such as Australia, all should be equal under the law, without
exception.

However, this legislation seeks to exempt the following from the new disinformation and
misinformation laws, allowing lies and embellishments without challenge or prosecution 
  - Government agencies,

  - professional news content

  - authorised electoral materials

  - satire

All other bodies and materials would fall under this law, which is based on subjectivity and
definitions so broad that they literally could be applied to anything, opening the door for the
potential to be abused by the Governments or the digital platforms, current or future.

To quote the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 – Guidance Note

_The key distinguishing feature between misinformation and disinformation_
_in the Bill is intent. Disinformation is intended to capture ‘misinformation_
_that has been disseminated with the intention of deceiving another person’_

https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/commu
nications-legislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-anddisinformation-bill-2023-factsheet-june2023.pdf

As stated in the guide, the key is intent. There is no mention of requiring any supporting evidence
to determine intent or even what is the truth.

In Australian law the matter of intent is often contentious.

An example of this is the difference between Voluntary Manslaughter (killing with intent but
without premeditation) and Involuntary Manslaughter (causing a death unintentionally).

The courts require proof to determine intent, this proposed law does not. So, without
accompanying proof how can intent possibly be determined fairly? It can’t.

Subjectiveness also applies to the bills’ definition of harm.

  - Simple things like having an opinion on immigration could be seen as racial ‘hate’.

  - An independent economist warning of an impending market crash could be classified as

‘talking the market down’ which could be seen as potentially causing economic harm to the
Australian economy.

  - Or how about someone telling the age-old joke ‘How do you tell if a politician is lying, their

lips are moving!’ This could be chosen to be seen as a comment and not satire, which could
be seen as harmful to Government and undermining our democracy.

  - Even Australian political opposition parties could be blocked on digital platforms for

opposing government policies on such things as health, economy, the environment, or any
other topic if it is not deemed “authorised electoral content”

There are existing laws that cover these issues, but they are tried in an Australian court and require
the burden of proof.

This proposed law seeks to curtail our existing freedom of expression and freedom of speech
without the requirement of proof by sidestepping Australia’s legal processes.

If the government and the media are truly serious about combatting misinformation and
disinformation, then it would not be seeking to make it legal for itself to lie.

In Edelman’s Trust Barometer 2022 it cited –

_“Moreover, a majority of Australians believe that journalists (65%),_
**_government leaders (61%) and business leaders (61%) are actively trying to_**
**_mislead them by saying things they know are false or grossly exaggerated”_**

https://www.edelman.com.au/trust-barometer-2022-australia

Recently, the Australian Federal Government had an opportunity to lead by example with respect
to outlawing misinformation and disinformation during The Voice to Parliament referendum
campaign, but chose not to.

As reported by The Guardian newspaper on 10 July 2023

# Parliament decided to allow lies during the campaign

_The federal parliament passed up an opportunity to ban misinformation_
**_and disinformation during the voice to parliament referendum campaign. In_**
_January the parliament’s joint standing committee on electoral matters_
_rejected calls to do this._

_The committee said “the forthcoming referendum is not the right time to_
**_establish a truth-in-political-advertising regime”._**

_But the same committee recommended in June (2022) that Australia adopt_
_federal truth-in-political-advertising laws that would apply to all future_
_federal elections and referendums._

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/10/voice-toparliament-referendum-politicians-campaigns-lies?trk=public_post_commenttext

I can’t think of a more important occasion that truthful information be mandatory then voting on
proposed changes to the Australian constitution, which is the highest law of the land.

Information and views posted on digital media, including social media sites, pale into insignificance
compared to changing the Australian constitution.

As the Government didn’t see the need for legislative truthfulness to be applied to the Voice to
Parliament referendum campaign, I can see absolutely no justification for these new laws at all.

At all times, elected members of governments should be striving to provide the most accurate and
truthful information to their constituents. This approach would encourage the Australian people to
turn freely to their government for the truth. This is how trust is built and democracy prospers.

Forcing a Government approved view on the people is not the way.

How does truth win in this environment? It doesn’t, the only winner would be distrust.

As Charles S. Lauer once said – “Leaders don’t force people to follow, they invite them on a
journey.”

**Responsibility of Enforcement the Censorship**

In this law, the Australian government will not have direct control of the policing of misinformation
and disinformation on the digital platforms.

The digital platforms themselves will be self-governing and they will determine what is the truth.

This presents the very real possibility that in order to remain compliant with the Australian
Government’s official standing on a given topic or topics, the digital platforms will censor more
heavily than the government intends or has flagged. In effect they will likely err on the side of
caution out of fear of falling fowl of the law, leading to the over-censorship of legitimate views and
options that will not be easily prevented.

This is not a positive outcome for a free and informed Australia, and the suppression of views and
opinions is anti-democratic.

We have been given assurances by the Communications Minister Michelle Rowland who said "the
_government has no intention of stifling freedom of speech"_

But I feel that this is exactly what this law will do, either directly or indirectly.

It would appear that the government is seeking to outsource the policing responsibilities to the
digital platforms, in order to allow it to say that they are not “stifling freedom of speech"

When determining what is the truth for Australian citizens, international corporations will become
judge, jury and executioner.

**The Scope**

The scope of this law is very large, encompassing a broad range of digital ‘platforms’ including
search engines, news aggregators, social media and podcast services. This proposed law is so
pervasive, that it even encompasses private messaging!

These platforms are the digital equivalent of books and newspapers found in the last century.

This sort of law, where it attempts to legitimise a single source of truth through the control of the
media has been used exclusively by what we would categorise as Totalitarian or Authoritarian
Governments.

Below are two examples from history (current and past), but sadly, there are many more.

The 2022 New York Times article “Russia Strengthens its Internet Censorship Powers” it states the
following: 
_The process, underway since 2019, represents the start of perhaps the_
_world’s most ambitious digital censorship effort outside China......_

_“This is something the world can copycat,” said Laura Cunningham, a_
**_former head of State Department programs on internet freedom._**
**_“Russia’s censorship model can quickly and easily be replicated by other_**
**_authoritarian governments.....”_**

_Russia is using the censorship technology to gain more leverage over_
_Western internet companies in addition to other strong-arm tactics and_
_legal intimidation. In September, after the government threatened to_
_arrest local employees for Google and Apple, the companies removed apps_
_run by supporters of Mr. Navalny ahead of national elections._

**_Roskomnadzor, the country’s internet regulator overseeing the effort,_**
**_can now go further. It has threatened to take down YouTube, Facebook_**
**_and Instagram if they do not block certain content on their own. After_**
_the authorities slowed down Twitter this year, the company agreed to_
_remove dozens of posts deemed illegal by the government._

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/russia-internetcensorship-putin.html

And from the BBC’s historic article “Nazi control of Germany.” It cites

_Josef Goebbels was appointed Minister of Propaganda in 1933._

     - _Goebbels controlled the media and arts, making sure that Germans_

_were fed Nazi ideology while censoring other information. . . ._

     - _Any media that conveyed anti-Nazi ideas or even other ways of life,_

_were censored. Censorship of newspapers, radio, cinema and the_
_theatre was enforced. Only books which agreed with the Nazi point of_
_view were allowed. All other books were banned and many were_
_publicly burned from May, 1933._

https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zn8sgk7/revision/3

Though the technology differs in the examples, digital/physical, this bill shares very similar aspects
to both of these examples. The main thrust is Government control of the flow of information in the
media, while stifling dissenting information and views that deviate from the Government’s
approved information.

This law opens the door for a government to legally produce propaganda, weaponizing official
information without challenge.

I believe we have seen a glimpse of this sort of behaviour by an Australian Government already with
its handling of Robodebt.

As reported in the Guardian Newspaper article, from 7 July 2023 titled: 
**“How the Coalition collaborated with ‘friendly media’ to silence Robodebt**
**victims”**

     - Alan Tudge’s office planned to use sympathetic outlets such as News Corp

to counter reporting on scheme, royal commission report reveals

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/how-thecoalition-collaborated-with-friendly-media-to-silence-robodebt-victims

This law would have made the Government’s actions legal, meaning there would be no recourse for
lying, the coverup or the damage done to innocent individuals and no voice from the people of
Australia.

Obviously, taken to extremes, this sort of behaviour would potentially jeopardise Australia’s
democracy and democratic process, just as the Australian Human Rights Commission has warned in
a submission dated February 2023 to the parliamentary inquiry into foreign interference through
social media  –

**“There is a real risk that efforts to combat online misinformation and**
**_disinformation by foreign - actors could be used to legitimise attempts to_**
**_restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce ideological_**
**_conformity in Australia”._**

In closing, for the reasons stated above, I would argue that Australia should never be following the
lead of either of these countries policies.

This bill is an attack on both our democracy and on our human rights.

Having full and unfettered access to a variety of information sources should not be a privilege, but
remain a right. It allows Australians the ability to exercise their free will and independence.

This is regressive legislation that allows for the suppression of Australians to be informed on topics
important to them. Being exposed to a variety of viewpoints and not just from some Government
approved list is how we as a society grow and mature.

Who in their right minds would have ever thought they would see the day where an Australian
Citizen would need to be granted permission from their Government to state a belief in public and
not have it removed on the basis that the view is not shared by the Australian Government!

Please, do not pass this bill into law, I believe it will be a massive mistake.

Thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback in regards to this proposed bill.

Yours Sincerely
