Good evening,

Today, I write to underscore the fundamental importance **of** **free** **speech,** opinion, and proper discourse as essential
pillars of a thriving democracy. I am a single mother to **anmson** and very fearful of his future,
civil/human rights as an Australian living in this country with this 'Disinformation Bill'.

This Government should not be able to propagandize the Australian people.

Vitality of free speech is paramount and our human/civil right.

Australians have lived and thrived without censorship since the advent of the internet. Yet here we are in 2023 as a
multicultural democracy forced to defend itself against the governments paid to govern for us, not over us.

History has taught us that when free speech and opinion are suppressed or silenced, the foundations of democracy
crumble, leaving room for authoritarianism and tyranny to take hold.
Therefore, as responsible citizens of this great democracy, it is our duty to defend and uphold these liberties not only
for ourselves but for future generations.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter

Regards

Mark Freeth
