To Whom this concerns,

I disapprove!!!

Too much of my hard earned income, that is stolen from me as taxes, already goes to sustain a
bloated government. I DO NOT want my taxes being used to implement this Orwellian policy and pay
for its upkeep. Nobody has the right, under the constitution, to restrict free speech. Nobody has the
right to choose what I consider to be misinformation or disinformation. You should be educating the
public on how to think critically, rather than brainwashing and propagandizing, so they can make
their own informed decisions on what is true and false. It should not be in the hands of unelected
bureaucrats, with vested interests, to decide what is misinformation and disinformation. I DO NOT
GIVE MY CONSENT!!!

Yours Faithfully,
