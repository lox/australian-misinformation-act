Dear Sir/Madam

**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill**
**2023**

Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the Committee concerning the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023
(the Bill).

I am strongly opposed to this Bill and indeed any similar legislation that is intended to limit access to
free expression of opinion and belief on digital platform services.

I can understand that the government and its authorities may wish to restrain information which is
clearly false and/or misleading and which, in the government’s view, is detrimental to the Australian
community at large. However, there can sometimes be a very fine, and often quite subjective, line
between what is deemed to be “false and misleading” and what is just information that is contrary to
the government’s stated position on a particular issue.

For me, the question on misinformation will always come down to: who gets to decide what is and
**_what is not misinformation?_**

ACMA’s report “A report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms’ disinformation and
_news quality measures” (ACMA, 2021) referred, by way of a case study, to the pandemic and the_
varied and often contrary information that was available during this event and the clear frustration
that government authorities had in convincing the public to comply with its mandates and edicts.

However, it concerns me greatly, for example, that news reports on the origins of the virus as
published during the pandemic by respected investigative journalists, such as Sharri Markson, may
well have been shut down under the proposed Bill if she had tried to publish her findings on a digital
platform rather than through a mainstream news service. Her findings were regularly discredited by
several news outlets, including the ABC, because the content did not conform to the accepted
government narrative at the time. It is only now becoming apparent that Sharri Markson’s sources,
reports and conclusions appear to have been true and correct. I am also aware of others who
published similar findings on digital platforms, and these may well have been removed under this
proposed Bill.

There are two things that the Committee should consider in its review of the Bill. Firstly, that most
Australians are quite able to make their own decisions on matters that affect them directly, and
secondly, Australians will generally source information that confirms their strongly held beliefs and
convictions, one way or another and quite apart from the “official government” line. Digital
platforms certainly make this process much easier these days, but Australians have always been able
to come to a rational view on issues affecting them either through the media or in their local
communities. Outlets such as the ABC traditionally were an important source of information but
sadly, in recent years, even this outlet is now perceived to be merely a mouthpiece for government
and thus many Australians have felt the need to look elsewhere.

I am very concerned that the Bill proposes to make use of digital platform industry codes to
administer the government’s controls on what information is allowed to be made available to the
public. The threat of heavy penalties would almost certainly force digital platform service providers
to curtail anything that risks raising the ire of government and thus will potentially skew information
more towards the government’s position. For example, I have already detected a bias in search
engines towards the “Yes” case in the run-up to the Voice referendum.

The main problem with the proposed Bill is that it potentially strips Australians of their basic right to
freedom of opinion and the freedom to express that opinion. I remind the Committee of Article 19
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of which Australia is a signatory: “Everyone has
_the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without_
_interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless_
_of frontiers.” The proposed Bill will potentially cut right across this basic freedom._

The Bill potentially has far-reaching consequences. It could be used to restrict free debate and the
sharing of ideas on a wide range of issues including, for example, politics, religion, ethics, views on
the environment, history etc. – indeed anything that the government deems to not be within its
accepted narrative.

I am very concerned about the open-ended nature of the proposed Bill and its potential to be
misused by a government seeking to control its people, such as we saw during the pandemic. The
government would only need to hint to the digital platform industry that it was concerned about a
particular view being expressed on social media and the Code would be adjusted accordingly. The
offending view, along with any associated information, would disappear from the platform and the
matter is dealt with – quietly and efficiently.

This Bill will not serve this nation well and I believe that the Committee should recommend that it be
rejected.

Thank you for your consideration of this submission.

Yours respectfully

James Beckwith
