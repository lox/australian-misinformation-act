Dear Sir/Madam

**Re:** **the** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment** **(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)**
# Bill 2023 (Cth)

I am writing to express why the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023, which is currently under consideration, should not proceed. The draft
legislation is an unacceptable threat to freedom of speech, access to information, and the democratic
principles that underpin our society.

The broad and vague definitions of "misinformation," "disinformation," and "serious harm" in the
proposed bill, coupled with the expansive regulatory powers granted to the Australian Communications
and Media Authority **(ACMA),** pose a grave risk to fundamental rights and liberties.

The proper solution to bad speech is not less speech, it is more speech. Attempts at censorship never
work, they in fact serve to legitimise the material which the Government has attempted to censor
amongst those disinclined to accept authority. A much better approach is to counter misinformation
with free and open discourse which will allow the truth to rise to the surface. Legislation which stifles
open discourse, curtails the dissemination of diverse opinions, and impede the free exchange of ideas is
counterproductive.

Further, the bill's potential to lead to self-censorship among online platforms is particularly concerning,

as platforms may opt to overly monitor and restrict content which is not misinformation to avoid severe
penalties. This approach not only undermines the principles of free expression but also hampers the
public's access to a variety of viewpoints and information sources.

Moreover, the bill vests ACMA with significant authority to determine what content falls under the
purview of "acceptable communication" and what constitutes "misinformation" or "disinformation."
Granting such power to a regulatory body carries the inherent risk of politicisation and undue influence
over the dissemination of information. This has the potential to undermine the foundation of a healthy
democracy by limiting the public's exposure to critical perspectives and alternative narratives. The
Labor members who may support this Bill may be perfectly happy for ACMA to have these powers, but

I doubt they would be happy for ACMA to have these powers while a future conservative Coalition
government is in power, I know I would not be.

Additionally, the imposition of heavy fines, such as those stipulated in the bill, could disproportionately
affect smaller online platforms and news outlets, potentially stifling innovation and competition in the
digital space. The resultant concentration of control over information dissemination could further

consolidate power in the hands of a few dominant entities, undermining the diverse ecosystem of ideas
and viewpoints that is essential to a vibrant democracy.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is not the appropriate solution to
misinformation. It should be withdrawn and not revisited.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I hope that you will take into account the
potential ramifications of the proposed legislation and prioritize the preservation of our fundamental
rights and democratic ideals.

Sincerely,
