Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation Bill 2023,

Dear Officer,

Please find my submission below as my feedback to a draft of the Communications Legislation
_Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I confirm that my_
submission can be made public.

I am a year old Australian, born and bred. I was educated within this great nation as a librarian
many years ago. I am strongly opposed to this legislation being passed as I believe the passing of
this bill would seriously impinge upon and negate all Australians’ right to their Freedom of Speech.
Giving the Australian Communications and Media Authority (an unelected bureaucratic entity) the
sole authority to be the arbiter of truth feels like a retelling of George Orwell’s “Ministry of Truth”
and more akin to the Chinese Communist Party’s control over its citizens than the democracy that
Australia is supposed to be. It is a lack of openness from Federal and State Government public
officers that has me concerned about limiting any further freedom of information and speech for
the Australian people. During the last 3 years or so I have discovered much of the Government
messaging about the Covid pandemic, governmental accountability and subjects such as the
proposed referendum on the Voice to be lacking either in truth or in actual details. There have
been many facts about Covid and the treatment and management of it that were initially deemed
to be “misinformation” or “disinformation” but now have been shown to be factual e.g. The lab
origins of covid 19 or the use of Ivermectin as an early treatment (Government and main stream
media messaging maligned this Nobel Prize winning and essential medication as horse worming –
incoherently an untruth) or the effectiveness of wearing masks. Definitions of what is
“Disinformation” and “Misinformation in the wording of this Bill, and similarly the terms “false,
misleading or deceptive” are not actually defined within this proposed bill. Who will be considering
and judging what is to be deemed to be the truth? Again, during the last 3 years of Covid
management the Australian public were told to “trust the science” – yet no qualifier was
established and any dissenting or opposing voice was ignored or censored!

Australia subscribes to the International Human Rights Treaties and was a principal signatory to
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, as such Australians have a right to:
_Hold opinions without interference,_
_a right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive and impart information and_
_ideas of all kinds, either orally or in writing, through any media of choice._

I note with interest in the draft of this proposed bill that the Australian government, main stream
(compliant) media and professional media journalists are exempt from this bill. Thanks to a
Freedom of Information request by Senator Alex Antic last December 2022 Australians have
already been subjected to heavy censorship when it was revealed that the secretary of the
Department of Home Affairs, Michael Pezzullo, had referred 13,636 posts on social media for
censorship, of which 4,213 posts were related to Covid – many of which proved later to be factual
information. While the government, both State and Federal refuse to investigate the increased
mortality rate in Australia, especially amongst working age people (ie those that were mandated
and coerced to take and untested vaccine), nor agree to conduct a Royal Commission into the
handling of the Covid 19 pandemic by the Australian governments (Federal and States), this very

opposition and at worst, hide its mishandling of the Covid pandemic.

If this bill being introduced with the vain excuse of protecting Australians from misinformation and
disinformation, then include the information that has been and will be disseminated by the
Australian governments and main stream media, about the pandemic and about the Voice
referendum. As an intelligent adult I want the right to read, hear and view all types of information
(bar that which is criminal, eg offensive material such as paedophilic and racially abusive content)
– even that which I do not agree with, so that I can personally make up my own mind on a subject
– I am not a child and resent a government treating me like one.

Even though this Bill states that it will be placing the restrictions and make the responsibility of
what is acceptable and what is not on the digital platforms themselves it is perfectly obvious that
this whole process will restrict Australians’ Freedom of Speech so that they will need to comply
with the rules of each digital platform, the misinformation and disinformation codes and standards
as ruled by ACMA, without any meaningful way of challenging this – in other words, this Australian
government is well on its way to creating the Ministry of Truth.

I ask that you do not proceed with the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and that you instead protect Australian’s right to_
Freedom of Speech. I do NOT want the government, be they State or Federal to become the
arbiter of truth and instead you need to defer that truth to the public, of whom you are supposed to
serve. In case you have forgotten, I have outlined the oath that each public officer takes in order to
take office – with some side notes on how the Australian governments have failed the people they
serve.

The Seven Principles of Public Office:

1. Selflessness: Act in terms of public interest – The public is interested in what is causing the

above normal mortality rates of its people! How dare politicians try to cover it up!
2. Integrity: avoid obligations to people or organisations that might try to influence their work

inappropriately – not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or material benefits for
themselves, family or friends and declare any conflicts of interest – i –
was advertising and was
found guilty of corruption and several politicians have commercial links to
pharmaceutical/mask making businesses.
3. Objectivity: must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best

evidence and without discrimination or bias – Instead, media campaigns for Covid smeared
those who were opposed to government covid messaging; The public was told to “trust the
science” and government messaging in blind obedience, with gaslighting, ad nauseum
advertising, while providing no scientific evidence and dismissing and smearing
experienced, world leading doctors and scientists and anyone who opposed this view.
4. Accountability: Must submit themselves to scrutiny by the public for the decisions and

actions they take: Again, government officials refuse to investigate the excess mortality
rates we are now witnessing in Australia and used the lame excuse that they are baffled by
this excess when it has occurred predominantly to the working age population of this
country (who were coerced and mandated into taking multiple innoculations that have
shown to be neither safe nor effective.) The Department of Defence, Government and
Pharmaceutical companies
) were given carte blanche to administer an inadequately, untested and unsafe product
all while being provided with no liability for any harms they may cause.
5. Openness: Public officers should act and take decisions in an open and transparent

manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and
lawful reasons for doing so. Accurate and truthful Covid information was withheld.
Ivermectin was made out to be a dangerous horse wormer despite it being proved that this
medication WAS and is effective against Covid, is an essential world class medication and
won a Nobel prize, yet government messaging, along with the compliant main stream, so


-----

ministers have ignored emails, phone calls, letters, protests and cease and desist orders
because they opposed government messaging.
6. Honesty: Public officers should be truthful – PM Albanese has been caught out telling the

public on several occasions on media appearances and in Parliament that the Uluru –
Statement from the Heart is a 2 minute, one page read and told Ben Fordham on 2GB
news that the Voice would NOT lead to a Treaty, despite Albanese also stating many times
that the Uluru Statement would be implemented in its full extent. Contrary to Albanese’s
flippant and untruthful claims, and thanks to Freedom of Information, the Uluru Statement is
at least 26 pages long with many more to accompany it in notes, and most clearly states
that the Voice WILL be followed by Treaty and Truth. Albanese has deliberately withheld
any meaningful discussion nor given the public any information as to the real meaning or
any resulting repercussions of The Voice. Similarly, Covid information other than
government messaging about the vaccine program was withheld or deemed to be mis or
dis information.
7. Leadership: Public officers should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour and treat

others with respect: Premier McGowan called members of the public “drop kicks” and told
them “to grow a brain” while displaying many times his irritation whenever anyone
questioned him about anything! Meanwhile, in Victoria, Daniel Andrews had his police force
shoot Melbourne residents with rubber bullets and threw elderly ladies to the ground.
Melbourne became the longest locked down city in the world, and Mark McGowan refused
to let Western Australian residents to return to their home state. Throughout the Covid
pandemic State and Federal government endeavoured to instil a permanent state of fear
onto the public through public messages on main stream media. They have mismanaged
this crisis, have refused to address the devastating shortcomings, have created an
unmanageable cost of living crisis, created a crisis of mental health conditions and
destroyed our health system– one that is now responsible for many needless deaths,
including my mother!

To the present Prime Minister Albanese and members of the Australian Parliament, both Federal
and State: I believe that on several occasions many of you have failed to honour your oath of
office as a publicly paid servant of the people. You have failed to uphold the law and the human
rights of the Australian people. You have destroyed the Australian economy and allowed outside,
unelected private corporations, including the World Economic Forum, The World Health
Organisation, The United Nations and other corrupted Corporations to influence your decision
making. My trust in the Australian government has been eroded over the past few years as a
result of the censorship and the overreach you have been practising and as such, I therefore
vehemently oppose this Bill.

Gillian Oats
