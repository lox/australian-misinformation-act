Dear Sir/Madam,

I write in concern regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, which I would like to be considered as a published submission. All other details that are
required to meet the Digital Service Standard for accessibility are noted in my signature below.
In his book, "1984," George Orwel depicted a totalitarian government that determines what "facts" are allowed to
be believed via its "Ministry of Truth." If established, the proposed Bill will effectively establish such a "Ministry of
Truth" in our nation, which is a decisive anti-free speech bid. The people in a democratic nation need to be guided
on HOW to think, not WHAT to think, but providing such guidance is not the role of the Government but of
educational institutions. Additionally, as parents are the primary educators of their children, this Bill will undermine
parental authority, which is yet another hallmark of dictatorial governments.
Accordingly, I urge you to express your concerns against this proposed Bill in order to protect free speech.
Yours Faithfully,
