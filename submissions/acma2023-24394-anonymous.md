Dear Minister for Communications,


I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed new ACMA powers to
combat misinformation and disinformation. I do not consent to these powers, and I
believe that they would be a serious threat to free speech and innovation in Australia.

The proposed powers are unprecedented in their breadth and scope. They would allow
the ACMA to censor any content that it deems to be "misleading" or "inaccurate." This is
a dangerous precedent, as it would give the government the power to control what
information people are allowed to see and hear.

The proposed powers would also give the ACMA too much power over digital platforms.
This could stifle important innovation in the digital economy. Digital platforms are
essential for the free flow of information and ideas, and they should not be subject to
government censorship.

Finally, the proposed powers would be ineffective in combating misinformation and
disinformation. The most effective way to combat misinformation is through education
and awareness. By teaching people how to identify and evaluate information, we can
empower them to make informed decisions. Government regulation is not necessary,
and it would be ineffective in addressing the root causes of misinformation.

I urge you to reject the proposed new ACMA powers. I do not consent to these powers,
and I believe that they would be a serious threat to free speech and innovation in
Australia. I also believe that these powers are a tip of the wedge into an Orwellian
dystopia, where the government controls what information people are allowed to see
and hear.

Sincerely,
