# No to the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

The right of Australians to express their views, opinions, and the active involvement in
forming our democratic freedom have been the cornerstones of our society since the
formation of this country. The freedom of speech and diversity of religions and cultures have
shaped our wonderful land and have contributed to the fact that we are one of the most
desired places to live and raise children in on earth. Many new migrants have found a new
home here in the 20[th] and early 21st century, as they deeply appreciated our legal system
and stability, but also the ability to express themselves freely, which is not a matter of fact in
all countries of this world.

The recent attempt of our government to introduce a bill that would give government
bureaucrats the right to decide what type of information is being broadcasted across our
media channels including an observance and evaluation of social media channels and any
publicly voiced opinion is a violation of our basic democratic freedom that has dominated
this country since its foundation.

As Christian I am concerned that this could mean that we are no longer able to express our
religious views freely and potentially no longer be able to worship freely in public places as
our views might not be the approved views of the government.

I was born under communism in Europe in the 1960s and have seen as eyewitness how
imposing of a government opinion on all people led to brain washing and the carving out of
democratic and eventually human rights. I have seen communism collapsing in 1989, and we
all should be grateful for our generation never to experience that society that brought
countless suffering to many nations of this world.

As Australian father I say no to this Bill for the sake of our children and all following
generations and reject hereby the introduction of a law that moves our country into an
undemocratic direction. Australia should remain a place that respects individual freedom,
and diversity of political opinions and views.
