{ SEQ CHAPTER \h \r 1 }Submission on the Communications Legislation
**Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**
To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts:

l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This proposed Bill would undermine free speech, which is a fundamental human
right, not one given to us by the government. Determining what qualifies as so-called
‘misinformation’ is subjective and entrusting a government agency to decide truth
raises concerns. ‘Truth’ is established by debate and open discussion. Therefore, no
one body of people should be allowed to determine the truth without debate.
Censorship leads to more harm than letting people hear different opinions and then
decide for themselves. We should be allowed to explore information and decide what
is true without having information hidden from us. The Bill would grant excessive
control to authorities and would lead to censorship, which is unacceptable.
Authorities have already shown that they will use censorship against the people in
self-serving ways. Freedom of speech must be guarded at all costs!

Sincerely, Cathy French
