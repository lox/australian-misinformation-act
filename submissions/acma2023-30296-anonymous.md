# Proposed new ACMA powers: ‘Have Your Say’ Submission

## To Whom it May Concern

 Firstly, thank you for allowing Australians to have their say on such important Legislation. And thanks also for your patience with this ‘essay’; these are weighty, complex matters that need due consideration.

 I truly believe it would be a serious mistake to give new ‘Powers’ to ACMA, especially along the lines of censoring so-called ‘misinformation’. This would be an anti-freedom, anti-democratic escalation of Govt power and control.

 I’m assuming seeking more powers for ACMA has partly, or largely, been precipitated by the last few years of Covid and the globally mandated medical treatments. And these in contrast to volumes of independent, medical and scientific opinion contrary to the MMN (see below).

 It seems clear that MSM is already heavy-handed enough, through (largely) nameless ‘fact-checkers’ and ‘experts’ in censoring, cancelling and slandering any contrary scientific and medically-evidenced online opinion. There is abundant evidence that Western governments globally have already colluded with MSM to ‘manage’ ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’. 

 Concluding this submission I have included supporting references and online links. These include authoritative and important evidence for the main points of this submission. Please do read them, the last is a link to a video.

 Before continuing, some abbreviation keys for brevity:

 MSM = Mainstream Media & Social Media.

 NCIM = ‘Non-Corporately Invested Media’ (my own term), or ‘Independent Media’, is a more accurate term than ‘Alternative Media’, or ‘non-MSM’.

 RCT = Random Control Trials

 MMN = Mainstream Medical Narrative

 There are literally 1,000s of highly qualified doctors, scientists, medical professionals, epidemiologists, etc, who, during the C-19 pandemic, have been very vocal re their counter-opinion against mainstream medical governance

## pronouncements nationally and internationally. Many have lost certification and important positions in hospitals and medical institutions, just for voicing their medically-evidence-based opinions re Covid-19 treatments. Their willingness to sacrifice their valued professions reflects their utter conviction.

 Science flourishes best when constantly questioned and challenged. The most effective medicines and treatments have endured years, even decades of such purging questioning, and re-questioning of premature conclusions. Such questioning has produced the most certain efficacy and safety.

 May I put forward a personal and illustrative example. 2 years ago I was on the Sunshine Coast on a family holiday, and experienced a sudden, acute attack of abdominal pain, to the extent I attended ED 3 times in 2 days, becoming so de- hydrated I was admitted to hospital for 6 days. While in hospital, I received 3 varying diagnoses of my condition; a bit of a mystery. One strong opinion was from a Specialist, so certain of his diagnosis, he offered to short-track me into surgery to remove my gallbladder. He was quite insistent. I declined until further testing was more conclusive.

 Subsequent testing showed my gallbladder was fine, yet I could’ve easily lost it there and then! Seemingly case-solved, from a ‘highly qualified specialist’.

 Upon returning to, I consulted with a Gastroenterologist, who after a  (2[nd]) Endoscopy, and a Colonoscopy, concluded I’d probably contracted a severe bacterial infection (there had been a sewerage spill in the car park of our holiday accommodation). Upon reflection (I try to be intuitive about what I experience in my own body) I believe that this 4[th] ‘medical expert’ was correct, and the first 3 doctors had diagnosed incorrectly. Seeking a ‘second’ opinion on serious medical treatments is often critical to the best outcome.

 Informed medical consent, bodily-autonomy and medical-info freedom should be a given in a free and democratic society. I was happy to hear from each ‘medical expert’ of the 4 above, but I had to decide for myself which medical treatment I would undertake.

 I also believe that it is very evident that there has been decades long, undue influence from the ‘giant corporate medical industrial complexes’, specifically ‘Big-Pharma’, on international and national medical governance bodies

## globally. For example, upon WHO, The US FDA, CDC, our TGA, and other very influential medical institutions.

 is an example of an individual medical authority who wielded huge influence on Covid medical responses, not just in the USA, but globally. There are tranches of evidence to demonstrate fraudulent and corruptive connections between him and Big-Pharma. Robert F. Kennedy Jr (nephew of the late JFK) has written a comprehensive book on this, The Real Anthony Fauci. RFK Jr has subsequently been maligned, slandered, labelled, and ostracised, even by his own family. He is now running as a Democrat Candidate for the upcoming 2024 US Presidential elections! He has successfully led litigation, class actions, against multiple Pharmaceutical companies, to the tune of $100s of millions. In so doing he has delved deeply into their corruptive influences on medical and other governance, globally. 

 Another complicating factor is, a handful of international, mega-Investment companies (eg, Black Rock), or their subsidiaries (they have been busy undertaking M &A for decades) have majority/controlling shares ownership of ‘Big-Agri’, ‘Big-Food’, and ‘Big-Pharma’ companies. They also have majority/controlling ownership of most major MSM international media outlets. It is simply a business decision, and responsibility to share-holders, for MSM to support the MMN, consequently supporting their own investments. In this and myriad other ways ‘oligarchs’, and NGOs like the WEF, have wielded undue, commercial, anti-democratic influences on 100s of international leaders.

 Hence, an Emergency Use Authorisation mass vaccination program was pushed heavily as, ‘the only safe way out of the pandemic’, and ‘safe and effective’. The truth is, these could never have been actually scientific statements, when C-19 vaccines were developed and rolled-out in less than 12 months. In the history of major pharmaceutical trials, the previous shortest duration of scientific trials, proper RCTs, before roll-out has been 7 years! It’s a known fact the independent RCTs are required to scientifically observe potential short, medium and long-term ‘adverse effects’. And the C-19 trials were conducted by  and like companies, themselves, not independently! Knowing that there would potentially be tens of $billions of profit; 100s of $billions for a global roll out, over several years! A stupendous conflict of interest!


-----

## So our Australian/State Chief Medical Officers, and others globally, all in sync parroted the same highly emotive phrases: ‘Safe and effective’, ‘the only safe way out of the pandemic’, ‘this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated’, ‘Trust the science’. Truthfully, none of these statements could possibly be ‘scientific’. They were purely slogans, advertising, promotions to represent the experimental ‘vaccines’ as the only course of effective treatment. ‘Trust the science’, is more of a religious statement of faith, than actual science! And undue fear was the foundation of the globally coordinated C-19 response.

 Any alternative, even medically-evidenced treatments, were treated with contempt. For example, Ivermectin, was not only labelled ‘horse-medicine’, it was banned for ‘off-label’ prescription as a C-19 treatment in Australia and many other countries. It turns out there are around 80, independent, peer- reviewed clinical trials internationally (USA, India, African nations) showing that it works as a ‘protease inhibitor’, slowing down the multiplication of C-19 virus in human cells, giving our natural immune system time to develop natural immunity against the whole virus, not just against the ‘spike-protein’.

 But ‘vaccinated C-19 immunity is better than natural immunity’ (another slogan) … for the first time in virological history! Not to mention, Ivermectin has been one of the safest and effective medicines ever, proven from over 50 years of use as an anti-parasitic, saving 10s of 1000s of lives in developing countries. ‘Horse medicine’ !?

 I realise the ACMA proposal will be about more than medical information, but clearly C-19 and the mandated vaccines, and the huge swell of protest has precipitated the ‘need’ to give ACMA new powers. This questioning of the MMN was not from a fringe-minority, but a ‘minority’ of many 1000s of doctors and scientists.

 And medical-statistical fact now shows us that Covid-19 had a case/fatality rate (CFR) not much higher than seasonal flu, and among people under 18, significantly less CFR than seasonal flu. Yet, globally, the MMN and Big-Pharma continues to push for C-19 vaccination of children, youth and pregnant women? 

 Bureaucracies globally have already wielded enough power and slander against authentic, medically-evidenced science for the past few years. The last thing

## freedom of information and speech needs in Australia is another bureaucratic layer to censor, cancel and malign NCIM. ACMA would also potentially be corruptively influenced by Pharma-$Billions$ already dished out to the WHO  and other major NGOs, major hospitals and medical training facilities, even many governments.

 The second highest fund source of the WHO is, The, also one of the largest investors in Big-Pharma. That’s massive conflict of interest. There are many such 21[st] Century ‘oligarchs’.

 ‘Wealth and power corrupt’. ‘Absolute wealth and power corrupt, absolutely’.

 By now some readers of my submission will be thinking, ‘it’s because of people and views as contained here, that we need more ACMA powers!’. Cancel another, ‘conspiracy-theorist’. However, amid the 80+% (my approx.) of nonsense that is ‘conspiracy theory’, the balance is conspiracy and fraud reality, smoke-screened by a plethora of often ridiculous theories. History is riddled with such conspiracy-reality, and not just in developing countries.

 One of the Govt Ministries of USSR was, ‘The Ministry of Truth’. Required reading for every ‘comrade’ citizen was the magazine, Pravda, meaning, ‘Truth.’ With hindsight we know this was Stallinist ‘truth’ that the Communist Dictators wanted all citizens to believe was truth. And we know it wasn’t objective truth, but manipulative, invested-in-the-Party, ‘truth’! Propaganda!

 Australia is meant to be a ‘free-democracy’. Freedom of speech. Freedom of information. Freedom of expression. Freedom of belief and religion … all within the framework of reasonable civil, moral and criminal law, of course.

 However, the winds of social and ideological change and pressure are threatening our ‘free-democracy’. Most Australians are educated enough to make their own medically informed, and other significant decisions. Medical consent is a vital part of freedom. ‘Informed Consent’ and ‘bodily autonomy’, has been violated in the roll-out of mandated C-19 vaccines. The MMN of the past few years has potentially violated the post-WW2 ‘Nuremburg Code’; which are internationally binding laws!

 Please do not allow ACMA to become the ‘Pravda’ of Australia.         (Supporting reference pages following)

 These are literally a small fraction of evidence contradicting the MMN and MSM. All of these should rightly have been headlines on the 6pm news, or front page of national papers. ACMA does not need more powers to censor!

 Dept of Health NSW, the last 2 weeks of 2022, actual data of C-19 hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths. Early in the pandemic, Australians were re- assured that ‘fully-vaccinated’ was defined as 2 shots. That rapidly changed to, ‘boosters every 4-6 months’. In Australia, as mandates relaxed, uptake in boosters dropped dramatically. Considering this, these medical-statistical facts are telling. There is a significantly disproportionate representation of hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths, in people who took 4 or more shots. Very low representation of non-vaccinated. For relevant summary see bottom part of graph page 4, and page 5.

 The number of doctors, scientists, epidemiologists etc who spoke up contrary to the MMN were not a fringe minority, but a significantly large minority. Examples: The Great Barrington Declaration. Signed by nearly one million concerned citizens, over 16,000 Medical and Public Health Scientists, and over 47,000 Medical Practitioners. There are many other such medical and scientific bodies and alliances globally. To ignore, and even censor and remove such vast medical consensus would be scientific insanity.

## “Ah, ‘conspiracy-theory’, fringe-journalism …” I hear someone thinking:

 The Weekend Australian, 29-30.07.23. Special coverage, Covid cover-up. Fauci implicated. ‘Science was silenced’, and this by the highest individual Govt medical official in the US! Many more pages of articles not here included. This is the sort of independent journalism mostly reported by NCIM, rarely in MSM (see following pages)

 Judge orders White-House to stop censoring free speech. So, ACMA is seeking such powers, as this American judge has ordered the Biden admin to cease, from such unconstitutional censoring!

 Note: ‘Children’s Health Defense’ (CHD) was pioneered by RFK Jr after he saw first-hand corruption in Big-Pharma and its hard-push for an ever-burgeoning multiplication of ‘scheduled vaccines’ for young children, amongst plethora other layers of corruption. Not ‘anti-vaxx’, but anti vaccine abuse against children in particular. 

 Are NCIM, like CHD, the sort platforms of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ ACMA seeks new powers to combat? Generally I have found that info on these NCIM platforms, much better researched and referenced and objective-science based than most content in MSM, executively directed to follow the MMN. On Wikipedia, every second doctor is a ‘conspiracy-theorist’, examples, Dr Aseem Malhotra, Dr Peter McCullough (Texas, cariologist), Dr Robert Malone, etc.

## Dr Melissa McCann, Covid Vaccine Injury Class Action, Australia

## 28 min video, an excellent summary of how Australian medical governance just followed lock-step with WHO and US Covid response strategies, that we now know, from medical-statistical evidence, were largely misleading, fear- mongering, vested in ‘commercial science’, and a failure! Dr McCann’s Class Action is not filed lightly. She had 650 pages of evidence to propagate her case, and she has put her medical credentials and career on the line. As have 100s of other courageous doctors, health professionals, scientists, lawyers, and politicians nationally and internationally.

 Again, what is referenced here is the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of factual, scientific and medical evidence, most of which can only be found on NCIM, and mostly already excluded and censored from MSM

 Conclusion: Please, NO NEW, ‘PRAVDA’-LIKE ACMA POWERS TO COMBAT ‘MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION’.

 Quoting the most positively influential leader in human history:

# “When you know the Truth, the Truth will set you free!”
