**I Danuta Hulajko totally object to the proposed Legislation  Draft**
**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023**

**Article 19 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:**

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes_
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart_
_information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers._

I am most perplexed by the actions of those in crafting this legislation and advocating
for these ideas. It appears that their decisions, influenced by financial incentives,
may have negative consequences not only for others by also for themselves. This
legislation has significant implications for life in Australia and those who contribute to
its creation will inevitably be bound by the limitations it imposes. It is important to
recognise the potential long-term effect of such legislation, as they may result in
silencing not only the present but also future generations.

**What is Democracy?**

Examining democratic principles is crucial as they form the foundation of a just and
inclusive society. Democracy ensures political equality, empowers citizens to
participate in decision-making, protects individual rights and freedoms, embraces
diversity and pluralism, promotes transparency and accountability, and upholds the
rule of law. By understanding and upholding these principles, we can foster a society
that respects human rights, ensures representation and participation, encourages
open dialogue, and safeguards against abuses of power. Examining democratic
principles allows us to critically assess the fairness, legitimacy, and effectiveness of
laws, policies, and institutions, ensuring that our societies continue to thrive as
democratic and inclusive spaces.

**Democracy is a form of government in which power is vested on the people, who**
exercise it either directly or through elected representatives. It is a system that
emphasises the principals of political equality, majority rule and protection of
**individual rights and freedoms. In a democratic society, citizens have the right to**
participate in decision-making processes, express their opinions and hold their
**government accountable.**

Democracy ensures that citizens have the right to participate in the political process,
including the ability to vote in free and fair elections and engage in peaceful
**protests or demonstrations. It upholds individual rights and freedoms,**
safeguarding principals like freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and the press.
Democracy values diversity, fostering a society where different perspectives,
**beliefs and interests are included, allowing for open expression and debate.**
It allows for a pluraristic society where various opinions and ideas can be freely
expressed and debated, whether in person or online.

  - A belief in shared power: based on a suspicion of concentrated power
(whether by individuals, groups or governments).

Democracy promotes accountability and transparency by holding public officials
accountable, establishing check and balances, and ensuring access to information to
prevent abuse of power and corruption.

Democracy promotes government accountability and transparency, ensuring that
public offficials are answerable to the people. It involved the freedom for oversight,
checks and balances and access to information to prevent abuse of power and
corruption.

This cannot occur in the face of this legislation. We are the people checks and
balances, freedom to share ideas. This proposed legislation doesn’t shut down, it
shuts down democracy. 'This cannot occur in the face of this legislation. We are the
people checks and balances, freedom to share ideas. This proposed legislation
doesn’t shut down, it shuts down democracy'

This legislation poses a significant threat to the fundamental principles of democracy.
It undermines the essential role of the people as checks and balances on those in
power and restricts the freedom to share ideas and engage in open discourse. By
limiting the ability to question, challenge, and express alternative viewpoints, this
proposed legislation not only stifles individual freedoms but also erodes the very
essence of democracy itself. Instead of promoting a vibrant and inclusive democratic
society, it risks shutting down the very foundation upon which democracy thrives.

**How this proposed legislation will promote injustice?**

The proposed legislation has the potential to promote injustice within society. By
granting powers to regulate and control information, there is a risk of perpetuating
systemic injustices and inequalities. The legislation may disproportionately impact
marginalized communities, as their voices and perspectives are more likely to be
silenced or marginalized. Moreover, if the enforcement of the legislation is biased or
selective, it can further reinforce existing power imbalances and hinder efforts to
address social injustices. To prevent the promotion of injustice, it is crucial to ensure
that the legislation is designed with principles of equity, inclusivity, and social justice
in mind. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact on
marginalized groups and a commitment to addressing systemic biases and
inequalities throughout the legislative process.

**Similar legislation in countries around the world that would have similar**
**legislation and how they are not democratic countries.**

There are countries around the world that have implemented similar legislation
aimed at controlling information and stifling dissent, and many of these countries are


-----

not considered democratic. In such countries, the legislation is often used as a tool
to suppress freedom of speech, limit access to diverse viewpoints, and curtail the
ability of citizens to question those in power. These regimes use such legislation to
manipulate narratives, censor critical voices, and consolidate their control over
society. By restricting information and suppressing dissent, these countries
undermine the core principles of democracy, such as transparency, accountability,
and the protection of individual rights and freedoms. It is essential to safeguard
democratic values and remain vigilant against the erosion of these principles,
ensuring that legislation promoting information control does not undermine the
foundations of democracy.

**What countries specifically would have similar legislation ?**

While specific countries can vary in terms of their legislation and approach to
controlling information, some examples of countries that have implemented or
proposed measures targeting online content and information control include China,
Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Vietnam. These countries have been known to
restrict freedom of speech, censor dissenting voices, and exert control over online
platforms to shape narratives and maintain political control. It is important to note
that the extent and nature of the legislation may differ across these countries, but
they share a common goal of exerting control over information flow and limiting the
ability of citizens to freely express themselves.

Several countries around the world, such as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and
Vietnam, have implemented legislation aimed at controlling information and stifling
dissent. These countries are known for their authoritarian regimes and have been
criticized for suppressing freedom of speech, curbing access to independent media,
and tightly controlling the flow of information. In these countries, the legislation
serves as a tool to manipulate narratives, censor critical voices, and maintain
political control. The restrictions imposed on information and the suppression of
dissenting views undermine the fundamental principles of democracy, including
transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights and freedoms. It
is crucial to recognize the dangers of such legislation and ensure that democratic
societies uphold the principles of open dialogue, freedom of expression, and the right
to access diverse sources of information.

This legislation can be seen as undemocratic as it undermines key democratic
principles. By allowing the government to define and exempt its own content from
regulation, it erodes political equality, citizen participation, and the protection of
individual rights and freedoms. This raises concerns about censorship, suppression
of dissenting voices, and hindering the diversity of opinions. Additionally, the
legislation compromises transparency and accountability by limiting public scrutiny of
the government's information dissemination. Overall, the legislation undermines
democratic values and poses a risk to the free exchange of ideas and the integrity of
democratic processes.

This legislation can be considered undemocratic due to several reasons. Firstly, it
undermines the principles of political equality and citizen participation by granting the
government the authority to define and exempt its own content from regulation. This
gives the government a privileged position in shaping the information landscape and
potentially stifles diverse viewpoints and public discourse.

Secondly, democracy thrives on the protection of individual rights and freedoms,
such as freedom of speech and assembly. However, this legislation raises concerns
by potentially allowing the government to selectively determine what qualifies as
misinformation, leading to potential censorship or suppression of dissenting voices.

Additionally, democracy values diversity and the inclusion of different perspectives.
However, by excluding itself from the legislation, the government may curtail the
pluralistic nature of society, hindering the free expression and debate of various
ideas and opinions.

Furthermore, democracy relies on accountability and the ability to hold the
government responsible for its actions. By exempting its own content, the legislation
may erode transparency and hinder the public's ability to scrutinize and challenge
the government's dissemination of information.

In summary, this legislation undermines democratic principles such as political
equality, individual rights and freedoms, diversity, and accountability. Its potential to
grant the government unchecked authority over information dissemination raises
concerns about its impact on democratic processes and the free exchange of ideas.
This legislation raises significant concerns about its compatibility with democratic
principles. By excluding itself from the regulations and allowing the government to
define what qualifies as misinformation, it undermines the core tenets of democracy,
such as accountability, transparency, and equal treatment under the law. Granting
the government the authority to determine what content is exempted from regulation
creates a power imbalance and potential for abuse, as it enables the government to
control the narrative, manipulate public opinion, and suppress dissenting voices. In a
democratic society, it is crucial for legislation to be fair, impartial, and subject to
checks and balances to ensure the protection of individual rights and the integrity of
the democratic process.

**Is democracy even possible if a self regulatory body is claiming what is or isn’t**
**true.**

The question of whether democracy is possible when a self-regulatory body
determines what is true or false is a complex one. Democracy relies on the free flow
of information, diverse perspectives, and open debate. When a self-regulatory body
assumes the authority to determine the veracity of information, there is a potential
risk to freedom of speech and the pluralistic nature of democratic societies.

In a democratic system, it is generally preferred to have a range of independent
institutions, including the judiciary, media organizations, fact-checkers, and civil
society, playing a role in evaluating information and holding those in power
accountable. A self-regulatory body with significant powers to determine truth may
concentrate too much authority in one entity, potentially stifling dissenting voices or
alternative viewpoints.

However, it's important to note that combating misinformation and disinformation is a
pressing concern in the digital age, as false information can spread rapidly and have
detrimental effects on individuals and society. Striking the right balance between
addressing harmful content and preserving freedom of speech is a complex
challenge.

One approach to mitigating the potential risks to democracy is to ensure that selfregulatory bodies are transparent, accountable, and subject to checks and balances.
It is crucial to have mechanisms in place for independent oversight, public scrutiny,
and opportunities for appeal or redress. Additionally, fostering media literacy, critical
thinking skills, and promoting a diverse and vibrant media landscape can also
contribute to a healthy democratic discourse.

Ultimately, finding the right balance between addressing misinformation and
disinformation while upholding democratic values requires ongoing dialogue,
collaboration, and an iterative approach to shaping regulations and policies.

It appears that this legislation to prevent asking questions and looking for alternative
perspectives when looking to validate and hold the government accountable when
things arent feelign or sounding right to the public. this is a democratic right.'
This legislation seems to hinder the democratic right of questioning, seeking
alternative perspectives, and holding the government accountable when doubts arise
or information feels inconsistent to the public. The ability to critically examine,
validate, and challenge government actions and narratives is vital for upholding
democratic principles. It ensures transparency, encourages robust public discourse,
and helps prevent the consolidation of power. Restricting the ability to question and
seek alternative perspectives risks undermining the democratic process and
inhibiting the public's ability to hold those in power accountable.

The government is excluding itself from this legislation, what questions does this
raise ?
excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the
following:
(a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of
entertainment, parody or satire;
(b) professional news content;
(c) content produced by or for an educational institution
accredited by any of the following:
(i) the Commonwealth;
(ii) a State;
(iii) a Territory;
(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a
Territory as an accreditor of educational institutions;
(d) content produced by or for an educational institution
accredited:
(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a
foreign government as an accreditor of educational
institutions; and
(il) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable
Australian educational institution;
(e) content that is authorised by:
(i) the Commonwealth; or
(i) a State; or

This legislation appears to have the potential to silence individuals who genuinely
ask questions and seek information. By imposing regulations and potentially
censoring certain content, there is a risk of discouraging open inquiry and
suppressing those who express legitimate curiosity or skepticism. Silencing
individuals who are genuinely seeking answers undermines the principles of freedom
of speech and the open exchange of ideas, which are essential components of a
democratic society. It is crucial to foster an environment where people feel
empowered to ask questions, challenge prevailing narratives, and engage in critical
thinking, as this is vital for the health of democratic discourse and the pursuit of truth.
In the context of this proposed legislation, concerns of potential oppression arise as
it grants significant powers to regulate and control information dissemination. There
is a risk that such powers could be utilized to suppress dissenting voices, restrict
freedom of expression, and perpetuate a one-sided narrative. If the legislation is


-----

misused or selectively applied, it may contribute to an oppressive environment where
alternative viewpoints are silenced and critical thinking is stifled. Safeguarding
against oppression requires careful consideration of the legislation's potential impact
on marginalized communities, minority voices, and individuals seeking to question
and challenge prevailing narratives. It is crucial to ensure that any regulations
enacted uphold democratic principles, protect fundamental rights, and foster an
inclusive and equitable society.

**This proposed legislation will be very biased**

The proposed legislation carries a significant risk of being biased due to several
factors. Firstly, by granting certain powers to regulate and determine what
constitutes misinformation or disinformation, there is a potential for subjective
interpretation and bias in decision-making. This subjectivity can lead to the selective
targeting of specific viewpoints or ideas that are deemed unfavorable by those in
power. Secondly, if the legislation lacks clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms,
it increases the likelihood of biases seeping into the enforcement and
implementation processes. This can result in unequal treatment and the suppression
of dissenting or minority perspectives. To uphold democratic values, it is crucial to
ensure that the legislation is drafted with transparency, inclusivity, and checks and
balances in mind, mitigating the risk of bias and protecting the diversity of ideas and
opinions within society.

While the proposed legislation aims to tackle misinformation and disinformation,
there are some potential risks associated with its implementation. These risks
include:

1. Freedom of speech concerns: Introducing new laws to combat misinformation

and disinformation can raise concerns about potential infringement on
freedom of speech. Striking the right balance between addressing harmful
content and protecting individuals' rights to express their opinions can be
challenging.

2. Overreach and censorship: There is a risk that the legislation could be

misused or applied excessively, leading to unintended consequences such as
censorship or the stifling of dissenting voices. Care must be taken to ensure
that the powers granted to regulatory authorities are used judiciously and in
line with democratic principles.

3. Effectiveness and enforcement challenges: Regulating online content can be

complex and challenging due to the global and rapidly evolving nature of
digital platforms. Ensuring the effectiveness of the legislation and its
enforcement across diverse platforms, including those based outside
Australia, can be a significant hurdle.

4. Potential for unintended consequences: Any new legislation can have

unintended consequences or create loopholes that malicious actors could
exploit. It is essential to carefully consider the potential impact of the
legislation on various stakeholders, including digital platforms, content
creators, and the wider public.

5. Regulatory burden on digital platforms: Imposing additional obligations and

requirements on digital platforms to combat misinformation and disinformation
may create a significant regulatory burden. This burden could potentially


-----

disproportionately affect smaller platforms or hinder innovation in the digital
space.

To mitigate these risks, it is important for policymakers to engage in thorough
consultation, consider diverse perspectives, and ensure transparency in the
legislative process. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the legislation's impact will
also be necessary to make adjustments and improvements as needed.

The risks to freedom of speech in the context of legislation aimed at combating
misinformation and disinformation can include:

1. Overbroad regulation: There is a risk that the legislation may be drafted in a

way that is overly broad or vague, potentially encompassing legitimate speech
and restricting individuals' right to express their opinions. Unclear definitions
and criteria for identifying misinformation or disinformation can lead to the
unintended suppression of valid speech.

2. Chilling effect: The fear of potential legal consequences or regulatory scrutiny

may lead individuals, journalists, or platforms to self-censor or refrain from
discussing controversial or sensitive topics. This chilling effect can undermine
open dialogue and limit the diversity of ideas and opinions in public discourse.

3. Lack of transparency and accountability: If the legislation grants excessive

power to regulatory authorities without adequate checks and balances, there
is a risk of decisions being made without sufficient transparency or
accountability. This lack of transparency can undermine public trust and allow
for potential abuse of power.

4. Selective enforcement: There is a risk that the legislation may be applied

selectively, targeting specific viewpoints or marginalized communities. This
can result in unequal treatment and a suppression of voices that challenge the
status quo or hold dissenting opinions.

5. Impact on independent journalism: Measures aimed at combating

misinformation and disinformation may inadvertently place undue burdens on
journalists and media organizations. Excessive regulation can impede
investigative reporting or limit the ability of journalists to fulfill their role as
watchdogs and hold those in power accountable.

Balancing the need to address misinformation and disinformation while safeguarding
freedom of speech requires careful consideration and clear safeguards within the
legislation. It is essential to uphold principles such as proportionality, transparency,
accountability, and respect for human rights to mitigate the risks to freedom of
speech.
