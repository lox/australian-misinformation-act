Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

It is my Will and right as an Australian citizen to express my deep concern and strong opposition at the existence of the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. I firmly believe
that this bill is a direct violation of our freedom of speech.

Firstly, and of the utmost importance, is that no authority, body, organization or person possesses the wisdom to discern
what is true or untrue. New information emerges constantly, contradicting previously accepted facts. I provide you with
a list of instances where authorities and expert consensus have been proven false or misleading over time. These
instances demonstrate the fallibility of determining what is true and what constitutes misinformation.

It is disconcerting that proponents of bills like this claim to champion truth while disregarding the concerns raised by
experts. Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious
reservations about the scope and application of this bill via his personal Twitter account. His scathing rebuke highlights
the challenges in implementing such legislation, further calling into question the government's claim to be on the side of
truth rather than censorship.

The proposed delegation of legislative power to private entities, like the creation of Misinformation Codes, infringes
upon the constitutional principles. This delegation unconstitutionally abdicates the legislative power of Parliament by
granting authority to private entities and statutory authorities, such as the ACMA. Such arrangements undermine the
principles of responsible governance and thus, is unconstitutional.

Additionally, the proposed bill violates the implied constitutional freedom of political communication, as the test of
misinformation encompasses matters highly contested among political parties, interest groups, and scientific
investigations. Limiting legitimate discussion on these matters unreasonably curtails the implied constitutional freedom
of political communication.

Australia is a party to seven core international human rights treaties. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is
contained in articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as well as articles 4 and
5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), articles 12 and 13 of the Convention
on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). These
articles highlight the right every Australian citizen has to exercise freedom of expression.

Another concerning aspect of this bill is the creation of two classes of citizens: one made up of politicians, journalists,
and members of educational institutions, who have the power to spread information, whether true or misleading,
online, and the second group, which includes regular citizens who often possess extensive knowledge on various topics,
particularly industry insiders. This classification not only infringes upon the rights of ordinary people but also places
undue power in the hands of a select group, undermining the principles of our democracy.

I view the internet as the most powerful democratic tool that humanity has ever created, enabling regular individuals to
have a voice and participate in public discourse. However, this bill poses a significant risk to the free expression of
ordinary people, causing disproportionate harm to their ability to engage in meaningful discussions.

The imposition of excessive fines on digital services will lead to unprecedented restrictions on freedom of speech. Even
the most restrictive digital services of today will pale in comparison to the limitations that will result from this bill.

Additionally, this bill does not solely target provably false information but also targets information that may be deemed
misleading or deceptive. The freedom of speech is invaluable as it allows for open and honest discussions, enabling the
exploration of differing perspectives and the discovery of truth through debate.

The bill assumes that the government and its accredited media and educational institutions hold the sole authority to
determine truth, disregarding the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians. This lack of diversity in viewpoints
stifles the process of sense-making and hinders the exploration of all possibilities.

Furthermore, this bill poses threats and impositions on digital platform providers and ordinary users, infringing upon
their rights and potentially causing significant financial and personal harm. This style of government undermines trust,
cooperation, and the free flow of information, reflecting a style of government that is reminiscent of the Soviet Union
and stands in opposition to the Australian values of integrity and equality.

To conclude, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023
poses a severe threat to the freedom of speech of Australian citizens and undermines the principles of democracy and
free expression. I strongly urge you to reconsider this bill and ensure that the rights and voices of every Australian are
protected, including the voices and rights of your own children and their future generations.

Yours sincerely,

All Rights Reserved Without Prejudice
