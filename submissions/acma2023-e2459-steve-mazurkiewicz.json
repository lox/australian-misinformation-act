      "This Bill is a most egregious enabler of censorship over the freedom of speech.",
      "The Bill tries to ‘control’ an environment which cannot be controlled.",
      "The Bill, if passed in its current form, would allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) substantial, unilateral and discretionary authority to govern all forms of media.",
      "The current definitions of ‘Misinformation’, ‘Disinformation’ and ‘Serious Harm’ within the Bill are unworkable.",
      "If such law is allowed to pass, it will not only signal the death knell of the internet as a free marketplace of ideas in Australia, but it will signal to Australian citizens, and to citizens of the globe, that the Australian Government seeks total control of the dissemination of information within its borders."
