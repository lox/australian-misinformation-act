Dear Sir/Madam

Re: New ACMA powers to combatting misinformation and disinformation (the Communications
Legislation Amendment Bill 2023)

As an Australian Citizen I do not consent to the above Amendment Bill on the following basis

I was born in and I had firsthand experience of what a tyrannical corrupted dictator government

can do to its people, anyone who spoke against the government were arrested and a lot people
disappeared never to be seen again and, in most cases the entire family and for what? Just for
exercising their natural rights of opinion and free speech nothing more.

I am in disbelief that the beautiful country of Australia that I immigrated to in can even

contemplate bringing in such amendments and I feel the need to remind you that Australia is a
democratic country and as such, no Government or Bureaucracy including Corporations should have
the ability to restrict freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech.

Australia is party to several International Human Rights Treaties. One being the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 1.1, Article 19.1, Article 19.2 Freedom of
Expression, states –

Article 1 (1); of the ICCPR: “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right
they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their social and cultural development”.

Article 19 (1): of the ICCPR: “Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference”; and

Article 19 (2): of the ICCPR: “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression. This right shall
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,
either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of choice”.

The Bill cannot be allowed to pass, if it is passed, this would allow ACMA, unilateral and discretionary
authority to govern all forms of media. It would also cancel out Australia’s commitment to (ICCPR)
Article’s noted above. In fact, this type of censorship is already happening now with respected
Senators and Media personalities as you would well be aware of.

_President Ronald Reagan Stated: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction._
We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on for
them to do the same.

In conclusion to this Bill, I feel that Australia is heading down the path of communism and tyrannical
control, this Bill, would allow a single narrative being applied by the government of the day and or one
or more of its Bureaucracies, I urge that this proposed Amendment Bill be rejected and common
sense prevail for the sake of present and future generations.

Yours faithfully

Cecilia Genoveva Rojas
