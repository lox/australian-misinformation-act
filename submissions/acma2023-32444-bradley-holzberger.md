**Comments on Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

**Summary: I object to the passage of this legislation**

Please note that I believe granting ACMA, a government-appointed and controlled entity, the
authority to label information contradicting official government messaging as misinformation
or disinformation establishes a disturbing level of control over free speech which I consider
essential to the efficient operation of our democracy.

This becomes especially concerning given the observable the effects of bias and conflicts of
interest, leading to biased reporting within academia, biased media content and profit-driven
public policies. History amply demonstrates the bad consequences of authorities making
decisions without being held accountable or having to be transparent about their actions. We
must be cautious when policies, based on concealed public policy advice (eg health) are
determined by those in power without the requirement for empirical validation and logical
reasoning and support, effectively bestowing on the government the power to define what
qualifies as true information.

As a taxpayer and elector, I wish to see the basis of all decisions of public policy and welcome
those decisions, and their basis, being freely debated. I am most confident in making an
assessment on a complex issue when all sides of the debate are presented. I consider
Australians generally are best placed to sift information and weigh up the consequences and
judgements required.

My views are consistent regardless of which political party is in government.
