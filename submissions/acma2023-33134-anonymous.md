# Oppose this Bill

I have been hearing a lot about this bill and believe if the bill passes it will change free
speech in Australia for ever making it more like 1984's Ministry of Truth where the average
person cannot say anything against the narrative of the government of the day (as they are
exempt from this bill) and some media, so how do the people hold government to account
if they cannot say anything that they the Government/ACMA/Bureaucracy/Academia and
social/& other media platforms deem as mis/disinformation.

The public will want to know exactly who decides whether content is ‘misinformation’ or
‘disinformation’. The significant penalties associated with this legislation potentially places
substantial power in the hands of Government and Bureaucratic officials. A classic example
of this was during the Covid19 pandemic where the Health BUREAUCRATS were all powerful
as soon as lockdowns began, dissenting opinions were censored and the public were told
get the jab (I did to keep elderly relatives safe!!!) and everyone will be safe, as it turns out
being immunised didn't stop transmission or getting covid19.
Big Pharma is involved in this as well, the application of scientific disinformation for
opportunistic purposes, as we were told to follow the science; once again no one could
speak out against the science, or any of the imposed mandates (some of which are still in
place).

By all means keep the social media platforms (which I do not use but a lot of people do)
under control and by that I mean them not deeming a certain side of a policy/debate is
mis/disinformation because of their political leanings, I really think they are out of control
cancelling people they don’t agree with.
This also goes for free to air TV, Radio and Print that will not allow all sides of an argument
to be aired.

Are people so lazy that they want to spoon fed in a nanny state being told what to say, do
and think or what is or isn’t true, I don’t think this is the case for most people. Make up your
own mind search for the truth, don’t rely on what other people or entities say!

I oppose this bill because there are always two sides to every story and if there is no debate
then there is nothing to compel the burden of truth/facts to be revealed.

Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental principles in our democratic society.
