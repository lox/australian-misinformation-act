The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian people that it distrusts
the public but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is undemocratic and will
prove devastating for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that responsibility
away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its citizens from ideas.
Australians must exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them.

We are all prone to making mistakes. No one is able to be the sole source of truth, most definitely not a group of unelected
bureaucrats in Canberra. The thought that an unelected body has that level of discernment is a joke.

This bill should be laughed out of existence.
This is a very sad time in our life when we are robbed of free speech. Please reconsider.
