# I place this submission in rejection of the online Misinformation and Disinformation ACMA act. I realize that my efforts may never negate this Governments under hand agenda to take away our most important of freedoms, our freedom of expression. Our Forebears died for this most basic of rights. This proposed legislation blatantly removes our freedoms. All that I have just presented cannot be negated, unless of course those who value SPIN and DECEPTION as their preferred way of conduct, all to enable their destructive agenda.

 As is the Lefts trickery they state all they desire is to “Keep Australians Safe”, Ms Rowlands current Minister of Communications quote. Again, it’s a case of looking under the presented and then observing the obvious. The Key recommendations finalizing in the report consistently claimed supposed Covid misinformation as the driver of this proposed silencing deception. However as usual once again if one looks under the presented rock then there is so much more. – I quote - harm means any of the following: (a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability; (b) disruption of public order or society in Australia; (c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government, institutions; (d) harm to the health of Australians; (e) harm to the Australian environment; (f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy.

 This broad range they have presented covers virtually every aspect of our lives.

 So let us test briefly just one small segment of the above list, I could prosecute so much more but I’ll try to keep it very brief. The list is reminiscent of much of the Left-Wing State Speech Laws already in place, the Left this time however now wants to tighten the noose totally on the ‘only opinion outlet’ ordinary Australians have. 

 Let investigate – Currently and falsely Co2 emissions are being reduced to protect the environment, however true Science not current pseudo-Science informs us this reduction is not only massively destroying Australian prosperity but also plant growth. True Science not Political Science informs us that the most prosperous period Earth enjoyed had atmospheric Co2 levels nearly 4 times higher than the current. So, if we revisit the above section F and then try to reconcile it with section E, then we finalize that this prosecution is in huge conflict. One could not make up this lunacy if one tried. We are running out of base load power, we have already run out of cheap power, the NER has warned due to Government Policy in two years’ time we face blackouts. The Government through this legislation will make sure we are silenced and cannot comment.

 This leads us onto the pertinent question, who is going to adjudicate the Truth, every successful civilization gives all the right to voice their opinion and this legislation destroys that right. After perusal of all detail, it is unclear as to who has the right to deny our Rights. Is it the

# gifted to the mentioned that they will be able to inflict fines of $2.75 million to silence any views that does not suit a political agenda. 

 That power is so great that they can force online platforms to also hand over their records. We must wake up. You who adjudicate on this submission must do the same, why, for the sake of our country.
