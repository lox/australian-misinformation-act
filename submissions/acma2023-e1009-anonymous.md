As the granddaughter of a WW1 veteran of some frightful battles in France and Belgium, and the cousin of a soldier killed in
action in WW2, who fought to preserve our freedoms that were under grave threat at the time, I am now very concerned about
the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a grave violation
of Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how unelected
bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

It also makes a complete mockery of the sacrifice made by countless thousands of men and women who lie in war cemeteries
and unmarked graves, having died to protect the freedoms the Albanese government is so blithely attempting to legislate away.
That such a bill is even contemplated is utterly shameful and an absolute disgrace to all who are pushing for it to succeed.

Please reject this extremely dangerous bill.
