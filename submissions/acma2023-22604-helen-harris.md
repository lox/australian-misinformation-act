 To whom this may concern,

 My name is Helen Harris, I am a grandmother of 2 young boys and a mother of 3 sons.

 I am wrifing to you in the hopes that this lefter will make a difference in the concerns I have with the Legislafion that the current Government wants to implement, on disinformafion & misinformafion. My concerns are that it appears that the government will decide, what they feel is perhaps a hate speech, an in accurate comment, or a public comment, post, video or picture . That the government will give the power to Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).

 We as Australian cifizens are all slowly giving our fundamental rights of freedom to speak away. This appears to be happening in other countries. So, I am wondering if this is a GLOBAL Implementafion???? 

 We as Australian Cifizens have a right to quesfion, and demand transparency in all levels.

 I do not support this legislafion, I do not support anyone to have powers over my right to speak, post, or share with respect about concerns I have or, about issues that will /or perhaps affect mine, my children’s, my grandchildren’s or the people of this country. I do not support the totalitarian type of implementafion that this bill, to me seems to allow. 

 Thank you 

 Kind Regards 

 Helen Harris
