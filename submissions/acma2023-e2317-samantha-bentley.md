Good afternoon,
Thank you for taking the time to read my submission against the proposed changes to give ACMA
dangerous powers to "combat" misinformation and disinformation.

The Australian government and unelected bureaucrats have no right to regulate anyone's speech,
or dictate who and where we get our information from. We have seen more than enough cherry
picked "experts" wheeled out on mainstream media, sprouting whatever the government narrative
is that day. Where were the alternative views or debates? Instead you resort to name-calling
anyone that disagrees with the government narrative.

After all, the government and mainstream media    - who are unbelievably exempt from these
proposed changes, are the ones who peddled the most misinformation, and the qualified and
credible experts were censored for telling the truth from 2020 to present time, and possibly before
than that without the public really being aware. But we are aware now and we are paying
attention!

This is a disgusting and tyrannical change to ACMAs powers and we do not consent.

There are so many things wrong with censorship, as the small example following proves.

CENSORSHIP...AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC DEBATE.

How did you enjoy all those nationally and globally-televised, robust debates put on by public
health officials, and broadcast simultaneously on every major news station?

Wasn't it great hearing from the best minds in medicine, virology, epidemiology, economics, and
vaccinology from all over the world as they vigorously and respectfully debated things like:

     - Lockdowns
     - Mask wearing
     - Social-distancing
     - Vaccine efficacy and safety trials
     - How to screen for susceptibility to vaccine injury
     - Therapeutics, (i.e. non-vaccine treatment options)

Wasn't it great seeing public health officials (who never treated anyone with covid) have their
"science" questioned.

Wasn't it great seeing the FDA panel publicly grill the vaccine makers in prime time as they stood
in the hot-seat of tough questions about products of which they have no liability?

Oh, wait...you didn't see those debates?

No, you didn't...because they never happened.

What happened instead was heavy-handed censorship of all but one narrative.

With so much at stake, why are we fed only one narrative...shouldn't many perspectives be heard
and professionally debated?

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SCIENCE?

What has happened to the scientific method of always challenging our assumptions?

What happened to lively debate in this country, or at least in Western society?
