# Totalitarianism

A society living by and for continuous warfare in which the ruling caste have ceased to have any real
function but succeed in clinging to power through force and fraud.

This proposed legislation is obviously intended to attack our individual freedoms, which rest on a
foundation of freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of consciousness.

If it were to pass, it will permanently destroy Australia as an honest society. Already too many people
live in fear of saying any opinion counter to the Zeitgeist. This legislation will only endorse that
dilemma.

# “Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.” ― George Orwell, 1984
 Our current predicament is such that we are enslaved by:  (1) Technology as a Means of Control;  (2) Censorship;  (3) Individuality Versus State Control; (4) Truth, Happiness, and Materialism; (5) Dangers of Totalitarianism.
 “One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.” ― Aldous Huxley, Brave New World

# “Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.” ― George Orwell, 1984
