**Submission on Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**

**_Disinformation) Bill 2023_**

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
_2023 will conflict with the spirit of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political_
_Rights (New York, 16 December 1966), which came into force in Australia on 28 January 1993_
_(http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/ATS/1980/23.html) and states:_

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or
in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and
responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are
provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or
morals.

The legislation will be an undesirable departure from the Australian Government’s current approach:

“The right to freedom of opinion is the right to hold opinions without interference and cannot be
subject to any exception or restriction. The right to freedom of expression extends to any medium,
including written and oral communications, the media, public protest, broadcasting, artistic works and
commercial advertising. The right is not absolute. It carries with it special responsibilities and may be
restricted on several grounds. For example, restrictions could relate to filtering access to certain internet
sites, the urging of violence or the classification of artistic material.” https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and_protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-_

The Australian Government’s Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023 pretends its aim is to protect Australians from online harm. However,_
the bill defines harm as expressing "hatred against a group" based on "gender" and "sexual orientation".
And "hatred" is all based on individual offense, which is extremely subjective.

The proposed bill could crush freedom of speech online, giving government bureaucrats the power to
be the “thought police” for the internet, imposing massive fines against platforms that fail to remove
so-called “misinformation”, which, for example, will include any comment made that the radical
LGBTIQ+ lobby deems as “hatred”. Saying that a man (XY) cannot be a woman (XX) will very soon
have one censored by law. The proposed law will cover social media platforms, search engines, news
aggregators, web forums, video platforms like YouTube and podcasting platforms. Just about everything
on the internet is in the firing line of this new Australian “Ministry of Truth”!

George Orwell wrote the novel 1984 in which a totalitarian government determines what “facts” are
allowed to be believed via its Ministry of Truth.  The Federal Government desires setting up its own
“Ministry of Truth” here in Australia, with potential for abuse of its power, especially if . The


-----

Authority is said to be independent but if the Chair, Deputy Chair, Member and Associate Members of
ACMA are appointed on the advice of the Government of the day, there is potential for political bias.
The Government would be able to trample over freedom of speech by giving a government agency new
powers to combat what it deems to be ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ online. The Australian
Human Rights Commission has warned against giving any body the power to be “the sole arbiter of
truth” and senior public servants have said that the bill would capture content in addition to that which
was ‘intended to cause harm” (The Australian, July 13, 2023). Options should be considered, including
improvement of the voluntary Australian Code of Practice without giving ACMA more powers of
enforcement and punishment.

Important questions are who gets to determine what is misinformation or disinformation and what is
the truth? The past few years have shown us that many things declared as “fake news” one day end up
being proven truthful several months down the track. The Government hasn’t said how they will
determine what they believe to be false or not, but they have said that they will target anything that they
think is:

`•` hateful against the LGBTIQ community;

`•` disruptive to society;

`•` harmful to democracy;

`•` harmful to the environment; or

`•` harmful to the economy.

All of this is extremely subjective and open to someone’s interpretation.

As a person who upholds the values of freedom and family in Australia, I don’t want the government
regulating what we can and can’t say online on matters of public policy. I don't want Australia to drift
towards an Orwellian nightmare with its own “Ministry of Truth”. Controls must be measured and
arbitrators free of political interference. There should be better ways than censorship of this kind to
tackle online misinformation.

_Threats to freedom of speech, writing and action, though often trivial in isolation, are cumulative in_
_their effect and, unless checked, lead to a general disrespect for the rights of the citizen.  George_
Orwell, 1948
