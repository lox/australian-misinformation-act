“For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is
**_misinformation on the digital service if:_**
the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive.”

# Who gets to decide if content is false, misleading or deceptive? Would you trust your political enemies with this power?

‘News content’ and politicians are exempt from the proposal. There has been plenty of
incorrect information pushed by the media and government over recent years. What of
that?

“harm means any of the following:
hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race,
gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability;”

# What is ‘hatred’? What is ‘gender’? I hate children and young adults being sterilised and mutilated as part of so called ‘gender affirming care’. Will I get into trouble if I say this online?

“The digital platform rules may require a digital platform provider to make and retain
records relating to misinformation or disinformation on the service;
Measures implemented by the provider to prevent or respond to misinformation or
disinformation on the service, including the effectiveness of the measures;
The prevalence of content containing false, misleading or deceptive information provided
on the service.”

# Again, who gets to decide what is misinformation or disinformation? What if the digital platform has a different view of what is and isn’t misinformation or disinformation?
 The proposed reporting requirements would require each company to set up a whole new department just to comply with this legislation, assuming they didn’t just tell you ‘No!’
 This is totally unworkable and will make Australia a laughing stock.
