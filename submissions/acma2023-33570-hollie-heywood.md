This Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 has got to go the way of the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Legislation
that was abolished here in WA only weeks after it was passed. Abolished for the same
reasons too as they are, one: unpopular with the people, two: they infringe on the rights of
the people and three: they are vague in their writing which can lead to amendments in future
that would further restrict the freedom of living that every Aussie is accustomed, and has the
right to.

In the past couple of years, with only the voluntary code launched by DIGI being in place, the
censorship on social media platforms has been draconian to say the least. Deplatforming,
shadow banning and restricting messages on private chat pages were the norm for many.
This stifled the ability for people share information so all could have an array of input and
ideas to consume and then make an informed decision on the best course of action to take
for themselves.

In an article by Patrick Hannaford for Sky News, Justin Quill, an experienced media lawyer,
said the proposal was “the biggest imposition on free speech that I’ve ever seen in a piece of
legislation”.

I think this is a main point in this discussion – the ability for public to debate information and
ideas so they can properly think for themselves. The access to information must be free and
not restricted to censored information that is, supposedly, not misinformation or
disinformation. With time it could prove to be the opposite and show that the truth had
actually been censored.

Shining the light of inquiry into the darkness of an issue is the only way forward in a liberal
democracy like Australia. When there is no debate, the likelihood of the wrong actions taking
place without being challenged increases and this itself likely causes or contributes to
_serious harm._

As spelled out in the Exposure Draft under Schedule 9, Part 1, (2) Definitions, those who will
be excluded for misinformation purposes include the professional news media – which will
only lead to more of the same misleading information being shared with no ramifications for
those spouting it as we have seen over these past couple of years.

And educational institutions also exempt?

I ask, is it ok for people to possibly be taught things that are considered misinformation but
are just not able to come by it on social media or to share it themselves on those digital
platforms, and then have the institution they paid for the education from facing any
ramifications of their misconduct?

No way.

In conclusion, my views on the Exposure Draft Bill:

The definition of misinformation and disinformation – the definitions stated are fine – so long
_as they apply to all, including the professional media, the government at all levels and_
_educational institutions._

The definition of digital platform services and the types of services we propose be subject to
the new framework – if any one is to be subject, it must be all, including professional media,
_the government at all levels and educational institutions._

How instant messaging services will be brought within the scope of the framework while
safeguarding privacy – no, do not bring them within the scope.

The scope of the information-gathering and record keeping powers, which includes the
prevalence of false, misleading or deceptive information on digital platform services – not
_necessary, at a stretch, it could be a reporting system for users only to use and only the_
_content reported only be gathered for review purposes._

The preconditions that must be met before the ACMA can require a new code, register a
code or make an industry standard – if new codes, registration of codes or industry
_standards are to be implemented, it must include all professional media, the government at_
_all levels and educational institutions no matter the preconditions that would be in place._

How the digital platforms industry may be able to operationalise the Bill and various content
exemptions (eg professional news, satire, authorised electoral content) – it must apply to all
_or none and operate through a user reporting system only._

Appropriate civil penalties and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance – civil penalties
_must apply to all including professional media, the government at all levels and educational_
_institutions. And be more severe for those in higher in the authority hierarchy of (going from_
_highest to lowest): government (with personal liability rather than taxpayer funded),_
_professional media, educational institutions, social media platforms, the general public_
_(including independent media outlets.)_
