A submission to this inquiry, thank you,

I accept this opportunity to respond to this invitation for genuine submissions of truth,and sincerity,for evaluations in your
deliberations into this,EXTREMELY IMPORTANT subject matter. A very serious study of historical facts is paramount at this
juncture, by "ALL" minds- committed to a fair, just,and righteous resolutions;The archives are loaded with records of abysmal
failed administrations across many platforms, Governance of/for nations, by no means the least examples of these failures; The
ancient Greek- 500-350 years BC period,an excellent example of how much death and destruction was metered,and endured,
when FREEDOM OF TRUTH,EXPRESSION was oppressed,plus- there are many additional tragic examples since then.

The precedent, if enshrined now- 2023, doesn't bear contemplation, in the presence of a thermonuclear annihilation war machine
just waiting in the wings- to be ignited by one-some of the "Rules Based Order"distorted minds, displaying ample examples of
misinformation-disinformation to the masses globally, that could be a/the catalyst for such a nightmare "vaporizing event", Think
about it, psychopaths do command extremely high platforms!

Within the official department explanatory details, of the draft Bill,it explicitly exempts any government communication of any
level of government from being considered misinformation or disinformation, REALLY??, Seriously- a classic Foot n the Mouth
example of a psychopathic mindset! (it reflects upon the ancient Greek example to aT!).
The twentieth century,( most recent period example), and continues into the twenty first century, is one of the most terrifying
periods of recorded human history for the scale of death,and destruction; Serious research will reveal-for considerably long
periods leading up to these catastrophic regional,and global war events, FREEDOM OF SPEECH,and EXPRESSION OF
TRUTH were systematically oppressed/denied its rightful presence in open public forums, by the fanatical warmonger- austerity
culture freaks!,and solidly backed up by the same, generational-multinational media baron families of today, Again- plying their
style of "misinformation disinformation distortion" publication tactics fielding division/s conflicts between sovereign nations.
Sure- social media,and other platforms are distorted with various levels of trivia,( but basically harmless non threatening
information); When some of your political forbears outlawed genuine Divine principle discipline practices from the home and
classroom;Unfortunately, this was one of the primary catalysts for today's immature behavior across all age groups!). The
science,technology,know how, are capable of, and already do remove much of the chaff mixed in with the wheat, that is flying
throughout the networks,

Free Speech Expression is enshrined in the USA First Amendment of the Bill of Rights Constitution- abridging the Freedom of
Speech,or of the Press. The United Nations enshrine similar principle values also.
