**(Combatting** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023)**

Dear Officer,

I am genuinely alarmed by the proposed Communication Legislation Amendment Bill (the Bill) and as such I have
decided to submit my views through this email. I regard the consequences of the passing of this Bill (in it’s current
form) to be dire for our Australian democracy.

I believe that the proposed bill undermines the fundamental principles of free speech in Australia.

I am convinced that the only path for this bill to be passed as an effective and just law is with the adoption of a
number of considered changes.

I have included a summary list of the 14 recommended changes to the Communication Legislation Amendment Bill as
contained in the ACMA submission by the Maats Method and ASF organisations. I whole heartedly support these
recommended changes to this Bill.
In addition to the recommended changes listed within the attached ACMA submission the following as additional
reasons for not letting this Bill pass in its present form;

       - This Bill is a most egregious enabler of censorship over the freedom of speech. I am amazed that a Bill focused on
restricting free speech is being considered in this country. Only a dictatorship would dare to put censorship laws
in place as this legislation attempts to do.

       - This Bill goes against the notion (and intention) of free speech. I stand by the idea that Free Speech should be
unrestricted and that all comment and opinion should be brought into the sunlight and examined in a public forum
so that all possible feedback and scrutiny may be actioned on it, publicly.

       - This Bill tries to ‘control’ an environment which cannot be controlled. The world wide web is a place where once
submitted, digital information will remain in existence for an eternity with little prospect of ever being deleted or
recalled. Passing legislation which endeavours to control this reality is ill conceived and naive at best.

This communication to you has been made in good faith and is submitted to you at this time in order to ensure my
views are recorded in this matter.
Kind regards

Steve Mazurkiewicz

**Re:** New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the _Communications_

Dear Officer,

###### SUBMISSION

 Introduction

 The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the

Arts **(the** **Department)** have invited feedback on an exposure draft of the _Communications_

_legislation_ _Amendment_ _(CombattingMisinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023_ **(the** Bill).

This is a joint submission by Maat’s Method and Australians for Science and Freedom.

Maat’s Method is a dedicated human rights law firm. That is, we practice only in areas of law

which are corollary to, or influenced by, the obligations Australia holds under the various

international human rights treaties and covenants Australia is a signatory to. This submission is

authored by Peter Fam, our Principal who has particular expertise and experience as a specialist

human rights lawyer.

Australians for Science and Freedom **(ASF)** is a diverse group of Australian clinicians, academics,

lawyers and public intellectuals who united in growing disquiet at federal and state responses to

the COVID-19 pandemic. As a truly independent think tank, ASF creates and disseminates

information and opinions from across the professions about what ails our society and how to

rebuild Australian institutions. ASF promotes intellectual and personal freedom in public debate

and public policy, championing the application of classic scientific methods to the analysis of

scientific questions and the transparency, contestability and accountability of public decision­

making.

###### The Bill, if passed in its current form, would allow the Australian Communications and Media

Authority **(ACMA)** substantial, unilateral and discretionary authority to govern all forms of

media save those explicitly excepted from the Bill’s operation. Such law would render Australia’s

commitment to freedom of speech and expression nugatory. The Bill is also, frankly, a poorly

drafted piece of proposed legislation that does not do enough to define the key terms it is reliant

on to give it any utility. Apart from being unworkable, such amorphism also renders the Bill apt

for misapplication by nefarious or negligent future and/or current members of ACMA; or

###### Government more generally.

 In this submission, we focus on the following key points, with recommendations included:

A. What are Australia’s obligations with respect to freedom of speech and freedom of

expression?

B. What does the Bill do and why is it problematic?

C. Conclusion

Please note, we prefer to receive our correspondence via email. 2

###### A. Australia’s obligations with respect to freedom of speech and

 freedom of expression

1. Australia is a party to die seven core international human rights treaties.1 Mostly relevantly, this

includes the _International_ _Covenant_ _on_ _Civil_ _and_ _Political_ _Rights_ **(ICCPR).**

**Article** **19** **of** **the** **ICCPR** **-** **Freedom** **of** **Expression**

2. The natural and most obvious Article to focus on from within those agreements is Article 19 of

the ICCPR, extracted as follows:

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include

freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of

frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other

media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it

special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but

these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For die protection of national security or of public order _(ordrepublic),_ or of

public health or morals.

3. It is important to say something at this stage about the exception presented by Article 19(3)

above. The Bill, in its definition of ‘Misinformation’ at Section 7, incudes die qualifier that such

1 It is worth noting that the seven core international human rights treaties are merely modern distillations

of much older principles. Jurisprudentially, freedom of speech and freedom of expression, for example,

have been recognised as sacrosanct since the Magna Carta, and indeed, by many human societies for

thousands of years prior.

information is “reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”. We assume, therefore,

###### that Parliament will attempt to justify the clear encroachment on Articles 19(1) and (2) of the

ICCPR that the Bill allows by suggesting that it is compliant with Article 19 in general due to

the exception provided in Article 19(3). Such justification, however, would be a

misappropriation of the exception, and a dilution of the intent of Article 19 in general.

4. We will provide more detail on the function of the Bill below, but in brief, it allows ACMA the

power to, among other tilings, create Misinformation Codes’ and ‘Misinformation Standards’

which would apply to anybody who disseminates information publicly save for those explicitly

excepted from the Bill’s operation (mainstream/professional media and Government).

5. The exception in Article 19(3) above states that the right to freedom of expression “may be

subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law **and** **are**

###### necessary.. .for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or

morals” (emphasis added).

6. “Necessary” is a high bar. It is also a very specific phrase, referring to something that is _essential,_

and indeed, _absolutely_ _essential_ In order for the Bill to claim compliance with the ICCPR, and in

particular with Article 19, Parliament must justify why the Bill in its totality, and all of the

individual powers it grants to ACMA, are **necessary** for the protection of national security,

public order, public health or morals. This would mean that there are no alternative solutions

available to the problem Parliament is trying to solve. It would also necessitate a particular and

precise explanation of what that problem actually is, and how the onerous approach the Bill

proposes would resolve that problem. None of that has occurred.

**Recommendations:**

**1.** **Specific** **particularisation** **of** **why** **the** **various** **powers** **granted** **to** **ACMA** **by** **the**
**Bill** **are** **necessary** **for** **the** **purposes** **outlined** **in** **Article** **19** **of** **the** **ICCPR,**
###### including reasons as to why less onerous approaches are not sufficient.

**Other** **Relevant** **Articles** **in** **the** **ICCPR**

7. There are two other Articles from the ICCPR containing rights which the Bill threatens to

impede. First, Article 1 of the ICCPR contains the right of self-determination, often referred to

as the bedrock of human rights. That is;

Please note, we prefer to receive our correspondence via email. 4

-----

1. All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely

determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural

development.

8. In today’s world, freely pursuing one’s economic, social and cultural development is a process

intertwined with and dependent on digital platforms, and the internet generally. Most

individuals and most businesses use websites and social media platforms to share information.

###### “Social and cultural development” necessarily includes the interaction with, and sharing of, ideas

online. All of these processes have become integrated and intertwined. It would be a simplistic

and naive view to claim that restrictions placed on people and their businesses by ACMA with

respect to what they can and cannot post on the internet would not impede on their right to

self-determination.

9. Article 18(1) is also relevant:

1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This

right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and

freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private to

manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.

10. Freedom of thought necessarily entails the freedom to express those thoughts, and freedom of

conscience necessarily entails the right to have access to a broad range of information which

might inform that conscience. Forcing independent disseminators of information to comply

with codes and standards imposed from on high does not facilitate an environment where

freedom of thought and conscience are possible. Even Article 4, which states that “in time of

public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially

proclaimed, the States Parties to the present Covenant may take measures derogating from their

obligations under the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the

situation”,2 does not apply to Article 18, such was and is its import.

**Enforceability**

2 It is worth noting the care with which the drafters of the ICCPR, and its signatories in agreeing to it, included
very strict exceptions to the rights contained within, triggered only by events that were, without exaggeration,
existential.

11. There is an unfortunate impression in Australia that because the ICCPR and other treaties and

covenants have not been ratified into domestic law that they are totally meaningless. Such an

interpretation totally divorces Australia from its obligations under those instruments, rendering

the citizens of Australia without meaningful human rights protections. It also ignores the fact

that, as a nation, we have covenanted into those agreements, including agreeing to uphold diem,

and failing to do so renders our collective word meaningless in die international sphere.

12. Beyond that, die argument that the treaties and covenants are ‘meaningless’ is also an

oversimplification of die true state of play. The ICCPR, for example, requires signatory

governments to create statutory bodies with die power to oversee and ensure that Governments

comply with the rights and protections within. In Australia, the _Australian_ _Human_ _Rights_

_Commission_ _Act_ _1986_ _(Cth)_ created die Australian Human Rights Commission **(AHRC)** who as

one of their explicit statutory functions within that Act are obligated to, among other things;3

(e) to examine enactments, and (when requested to do so by the Minister) proposed

enactments, for the purpose of ascertaining whether die enactments or proposed

enactments, as the case may be, are, or would be, inconsistent with or contrary to any

human right, and to report to die Minister die results of any such examination; and

(f) to:

(i) inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to any

human right; and

(ii) if die Commission considers it appropriate to do so—endeavour, by

conciliation, to effect a settlement of die matters that gave rise to die inquiry...

13. The AHRC, therefore, has an obligation to examine die Bill to ascertain whether it is

inconsistent with any human right (we say it clearly is). In addition, Section 11 (f) arguably allows

the submission of complaints by people who might be affected by die Bill, if passed, on the

basis that their right to freedom of expression has been curtailed (for example). The AHRC, and

the Department, should be aware of this. There could be an avalanche of complaints given the

###### poor drafting of the Bill and the broad and unchecked power it purports to give to ACMA.

14. In addition, under the _Human_ _Rights_ _(Parliamentary_ _Scrutiny)_ _Act_ _2011_ all new Bills must be

accompanied by a Statement of Compatibility, which assesses die compatibility of the proposed

legislation with the rights and freedoms recognised in the seven core international human rights

treaties that Australia has ratified, including the ICCPR. Such statement should be publicly

released immediately given the gravity and proposed scope of the Bill, so that the public can

meaningfully consider whether the Department has paid appropriate mind to those rights. In

addition, the necessary establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights

should occur early and in a transparent manner for the same reason.

15. There is, within die Bill, an accommodation for, and an acknowledgement of, die implied

freedom of political communication that die High Court has held exists as an indispensable part

###### of die system of representative and responsible government created by the Constitution.4 As a

result, at several points, such as in die creation of Misinformation standards’ die Bill says that

ACMA;

.. .must consider:

(a) whether die standard would burden freedom of political communication; and

(b) if so, whether the burden would be reasonable and not excessive, having regard to

any circumstances the ACMA considers relevant.

16. If it is not already obvious, the above provides illusory protection. The framing of it, firstly,

renders ACMA die sole arbiter, at its sole discretion, of whether die standard (in this example)

burdens freedom of political communication, and in any event only forces them to “consider”

the possibility, rather than to ensure such a burden is avoided or mitigated in any tangible way.

###### In addition, ACMA is left to adjudge reasonableness based on “any circumstances [it] considers

relevant”. This is, all in all, hardly an effective protection of one of die only human rights that

our Constitution protects; albeit via implication. Thankfully, to die Bill’s credit, Section 60 does

exclude die operation of the Bill itself, as well as any rules, codes or standards created under it,

###### to the extent that "their operation would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied

freedom of political communication”. However, this is only die bare minimum, given the High

Court has emphatically recognised die existence of that right within our constitution. And,

problematically, the construction of Section 60 invites retrospective correction via litigation, as

opposed to ensuring ACMA pays appropriate mind to the right in die first place.

17. By way of comparison, it is worth examining die following extract from die Fact Sheet:5

**Code** **of** **practice** **registration**

Should die ACMA determine that stronger action is needed to protect Australians, it

could request that a section of the industry put in place a new and more effective code of

practice (than die existing DIGI voluntary code of practice, for example). Once the

ACMA is satisfied a draft code presented to it by industry meets a number of criteria, it

may register it which makes compliance with it compulsory for all digital services

providers in the relevant segment of die industry. This would include those providers

who chose not to sign up to a voluntary code.

18. The ‘DIGI voluntary code of practice’ **(the** **DIGI** **Code)** referred to above, which die Fact

Sheet somewhat ominously suggests that ACMA may find ineffective and subsequently replace,

is a current, voluntary code of practice which several of the largest social media companies in

Australia have already subscribed to. Interestingly, that Code does something which the Bill

does not do, which is to include explicitly, as one of its ‘Guiding Principles’, an

acknowledgement of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, as follows:6

2. Guiding Principles

2.1. Protection of freedom of expression: Digital platforms provide a vital avenue for

die open exchange of opinion, speech, information, research and debate and

conversation as well as creative and other expression across die Australian

community. Signatories should not be compelled by Governments or other parties

to remove content solely on die basis of its alleged falsity if die content would not

otherwise be unlawful. Given its subject matter, die Code gives special attention

to international human rights as articulated within the Universal Declaration on

Human Rights, including but not limited to freedom of speech. Signatories are

encouraged to, in developing proportionate responses to Disinformation and

-----

Misinformation be cognisant of the need to protect these rights.

19. The above extracted principle suggests a sound approach. By centering itself on the foundation

###### that the open exchange of opinion and ideas is vital to a democratic society, and that such

openness is vital to human rights protections, the DIGI Code is able to provide a much more

tangible approach to the control of online information. That is, that “signatories should not be

compelled by Governments or other parties to remove content solely on the basis of its alleged

falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful”. There is no such acknowledgement, and

no such attempt at reasonable mitigation of power, in the Bill; and it is concerning, to say the

least, that the Fact Sheet (and the construction of the Bill itself) suggests that the DIGI Code

may be deemed insufficient, in circumstances where the proposed replacement is woefully

drafted and befitting of corrupted and/or negligent application.

**Recommendations:**

**2.** **The** **Department** **and** **the** **AHRC** **should** **collaborate** **to** **ensure,** **as** **per** **the**

###### AHRC’s statutory function, that the Bill is compatible with Australia’s

 human rights obligations at international law;

**3.** **The** **Department** **should** **immediately** **release** **the** **Statement** **of** **Compatibility**

**for** **public** **scrutiny,** **and** **confirm** **the** **establishment** **of** **the** **Parliamentary** **Joint**

**5.** **Include** **Guidance** **Principles** **within** **the** **Bill** **that** **make** **clear** **the** **importance**

###### of freedom of speech and expression, and which force ACMA to

**acknowledge** **these** **rights** **when** **making** **decisions;**

**6.** **Follow** **the** **DIGI** **Code’s** **lead** **in** **ensuring** **that** **content** **producers** **should** **not**

###### be compelled by Governments or other parties to remove content solely on

 the basis of its alleged falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful.

 B. What does the Bill do and Why is it Problematic?

 The Bill’s stated Intention

20. The Bill has been released to the public for comment alongside a ‘Guidance Note’ and a ‘Fact

Sheet’. Both of those documents seek to justify the Bill’s existence by stating that

Please note, we prefer to receive our correspondence via email. 9

Liability is limited by a scheme approved under professional standards legislation


-----

“misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as

well as our democracy, society and economy”.7

21. There are also several comments made in an effort to mitigate any perceived overreach within

the Bill. For example:

a. “The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed

###### from digital platform services”;8

b. “the Bill is directed at encouraging digital platform providers to have robust systems and

measures in place to address misinformation and disinformation on their services, rather

than the ACMA directly regulating individual pieces of content”;9

c. “rules made under the Bill may require digital platform services to have systems and

processes in place to address misinformation or disinformation that meets a threshold

###### of being likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”;10

d. “the proposed ACMA powers will support the success of the voluntary industry code

currently in place”;11

e. “the proposed powers will only apply to misinformation and disinformation that is

reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”;1213and

f. “the proposed powers are designed to encourage digital platform services to be

accountable for improving and implementing measures to counter the spread of

misinformation and disinformation online (i.e. they have a ‘systems’ focus rather than an

individual content focus”.10

22. With respect to the interplay of the proposed powers that the Bill would grant to ACMA and

freedom of speech and expression, the Guidance Note states as follows:

8 Fact Sheet, page 1.

-----

The proposed powers seek to strike a balance between the public interest in combatting

the serious harms that can arise from the propagation of misinformation and

disinformation, with freedom of speech.

The Bill aims to incentivise digital platform providers to have robust systems and

measures in place to address misinformation and disinformation on their services, rather

than the ACMA directly regulating individual pieces of content. The Bill does not seek

###### to curtail freedom of speech, nor is it intended that powers will be used to remove

individual pieces of content on a platform. The proposed definition of misinformation

and disinformation is intended to provide guidance on the types of harms die powers

are designed to address. The concept of ‘serious harm’ is intended to ensure that the

ACMA’s use of its powers, and die platforms’ systems and processes, are targeted at

harms with significant implications for the community.

23. In brief, die Department wants to say that die Bill:

a. is necessary to protect Australians from misinformation and disinformation, which is

harmful;

b. allows ACMA powers which will only be used when and if necessary (being, in

circumstances where die industry does not adequately regulate itself); and

c. is targeted towards digital platform companies, rather than individuals.

24. All of the above may very well be a genuine expression of die intent of die Department in

drafting and proposing the Bill. However, problematically, there is a significant chasm between

those stated intentions and purported safeguards, and die wording and proposed operation of

the Bill itself.

**What** **does** **the** **Bill** **do?**

25. In brief, die Bill would enable ACMA three broad powers:

a. to gather information from, or require digital platform providers to keep certain records

about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation;

Please note, we prefer to receive our correspondence via email. 11

Liability is limited by a scheme approved under professional standards legislation


-----

b. to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to combat

misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could register

and enforce; and

c. to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation), should a code

###### of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and disinformation on

digital platforms.

###### The Bill places unacceptable restrictions on any Individual who posts content online

26. As noted above, there is a stated intention with the Fact Sheet and Guidance Note that the Bill

is aimed at ‘digital platform providers’ and not at individual content or posts. This, however,

despite misleading assertions to the contrary in the Fact Sheet and Guidance Note, is not how

the Bill actually works.

27. The Bill makes clear that “content is provided on a digital service if the content is.. .accessible

###### to end-users using the digital service”.14 In addition, a “service is provided to the public if.. .the

service is provided to at least one person outside the immediate circle.. .of the person who

provides the service”.15 The above definitions taken in tandem mean that an individual who

posts content online which is accessible to more than one other person is captured by the

various powers the Bill grants ACMA. That individual (any Australian citizen who posts

something online) would need to comply with any digital platform rules, or misinformation

codes or standards, that ACMA implements under the Bill. That individual would also be

subject to the severe civil and criminal penalties that the Bill implements if those

codes/standards are breached.

28. This approach is, quite frankly, an unacceptable and inappropriate imposition of executive

regulation on the citizenry of Australia. It is a flagrant dismissal of the rights to freedom of

speech and expression Australia has covenanted into protecting. It would render any citizen

who chooses to express themselves in a digital form subject to regulatory frameworks that have

###### not even been created yet, unilaterally imposed by ACMA, and not subject to meaningful

challenge. That is not the way a democratic society works. It would signal the end of the

###### internet as a free market of ideas and opinions and render criticism of Government, an essential

element of any healthy democracy, vulnerable to civil and criminal prosecution.

**Recommendations:**

**7.** **Amend** **the** **definition** **of** **‘digital** **service’** **to** **clarify** **and** **ensure** **that** **an**

**individual** **who** **posts** **on** **a** **social** **media** **platform** **is** **outside** **of** **the** **scope** **of**

**the** **Bill’s** **operation.**

###### The Definitions of Misinformation, Disinformation and Serious Harm are vague, and as a result

are not functional

29. The Bill is predicated on the idea that ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ are harmful to

Australians; and that Australians must be protected from it via Government regulation. It is

therefore essential to consider the definitions of these terms within the Bill, which in many ways

are at its centre.

30. The definition of ‘misinformation’ within the Bill is as follows:16

(1) For die purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is

_misinformation_ on die digital service if:

(a) the content contains information diat is false, misleading or deceptive; and

(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes; and

(c) the content is provided on die digital service to one or more end-users in

Australia; and

(d) the provision of the content on die digital service is reasonably likely to cause

###### or contribute to serious harm.

**(The** **Misinformation** **Definition)**

16 The Bill, Section 7(1).

Please note, we prefer to receive our correspondence via email. 13

-----

31. The definition of ‘disinformation’ within the Bill is functionally similar, except that it includes an

additional qualifier, being that “the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the

###### content intends that the content deceive another person” (emphasis added).17

32. The primary issue with these definitions is that they rely on an assessment that the impugned

information is “false, misleading or deceptive”. None of the terms “false”, “misleading” or

###### “deceptive” are defined in the Bill itself. This may be because what is considered “false or

misleading”, or what is considered truthful, is rarely straightforward. In science, for example,

there is no such tiling as 'truth'. There are only hypotheses, based on data and evidence, which

themselves are frequently subject to change. A collective and unchallenged scientific position is

rare         - and even then it will seldom be referred to as 'truth', but merely the best available current

theory. It is a dangerous idea to suggest that only ‘true’ information should be allowed to be

disseminated to the public, when not everybody agrees on what is ‘true’ and what isn’t. Such an

approach will have the consequence of stifling scientific debate; and particularly in areas of

current controversy, which are usually the most pressing and important.18

33. The Guidance Note states that “ACMA [will not] have a role in determining what is considered

###### truthful”.19 This is misleading. While the Bill itself doesn’t explicitly allow ACMA to define or

determine what information is true, misleading or deceptive, it does allow ACMA the power to

create enforceable and compulsory rules, codes and standards that will do just that. The Bill also

creates an obligation for ‘digital platform services’ to themselves define those terms, because if

they don’t, for example, “prevent or respond to misinformation on digital platform services”20

they may be subject to civil and criminal penalty. In this way, the drafters of this Bill have

avoided the impossible task of drafting definitions of “false, misleading or deceptive” by passing

the buck to social media companies, without considering that it will be impossible for those

companies to properly define those terms themselves. The result of all of this will be ACMA

###### and/or digital media companies arbitrarily, and without proper qualification, frantically

17 The Bill, Section 7(2).

18 It is useful to consider the pandemic as an example of these issues. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the World
Health Organisation frequently changed their recommendations with respect to several aspects of pandemic
management, due to the constantly changing nature of the science and evidence. The State and Territory
Governments were similarly turbulent in their recommendations; many of which have subsequently proven to
be incorrect. If the Bill had been passed before the pandemic, thousands of Australians who shared their
opinions, often evidence based, on these recommendations could have been found to have engaged in
'misinformation'; despite later being vindicated as the science and evidence properly emerged. This would be
an unacceptable, counterproductive and dangerous state of affairs.

determining what is true and what isn’t, in a world where what is true and what isn’t is

constantly changing. It will be a mess for ACMA, for digital platforms and for individuals; with

civil and criminal consequences. The uncertainty this creates would almost certainly result in

censorship out of caution in an effort to avoid potential liability.

34. This is not helped by the definition of “serious harm” that die Bill includes, which is itself more

###### of a principle of guidance than a definition, imbued with enough subjectivity to make the

 purported definition meaningless. Section 7(3) of Schedule 1 states:

7(3) For the purposes of this Schedule, in determining whether die provision of content

on a digital service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm, have regard

to die following matters:

(a) the circumstances in which die content is disseminated;

(b) die subject matter of die false, misleading or deceptive information in die

content;

(c) die potential reach and speed of the dissemination;

(d) die severity of the potential impacts of the dissemination;

(e) die author of the information;

(t) the purpose of tire dissemination;

(g) whether the information has been attributed to a source and, if so, die

authority of die source and whether die attribution is correct;

(h) other related false, misleading or deceptive information disseminated; and

(i) any other relevant matter.

35. This is particularly concerning given that one of die primary checks and balances that the

Guidance Note and Fact Sheet point to is die idea that it is only misinformation that might

cause ‘serious harm’ that the Bill seeks to mitigate. Unfortunately, as is clear from the

construction of die Bill, “any other relevant matter” could be seen to characterise information

###### that is “reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”. It is a catch-all definition with

boundaries insufficient for die conveyance of any real meaning. Such definitions are apt for

negligent and intentional misuse.

**Recommendations:**

**8.** **The** **current** **definitions** **of** **‘Misinformation’,** **‘Disinformation’** **and** **‘Serious**

###### Harm’ within the Bill are unworkable. Given that the Bill rests upon these

 definitions, this renders the Bill itself unworkable. The definitions should be

 amended such that they are not contingent on the identification of “truth”,

 but are rather aimed at capturing content that is of a criminal character, or

 which constitutes a criminal offence.

 The Principle of Legality

36. If the Bill is allowed to pass in its current or in a comparable form, such amorphous definitions

will pose issues for future Courts in their attempted interpretation of it. Via what is commonly

known as die principle of legality, Brennan J noted in _Re_ _Holton_ that “unless the Parliament

makes unmistakably clear its intention to abrogate or suspend a fundamental freedom, die

courts will not construe a statute as having diat operation”. In this case, die Bill is supposedly

intended to strike a balance between protecting Australians and ensuring freedom of speech and

expression. Inherent in that stated intention is an acknowledgement that freedom of speech and

expression are important, and the Guidance Note and Fact Sheet both espouse this view as well.

The issue is that die Bill is unclear on die extent to which it seeks to abrogate those rights; and

the vague definitions within do not help. In _R_ _v_ _Secretary_ _ofStatefor_ _the_ _Home_ _Department;_ _Exparte_

_Simms_ _[2000f21_ Lord Hoffman stated as follows:

die principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing

and accept die political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or

ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that die full implications of

their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in die democratic process. In die

absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, die courts therefore

presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to die basic rights

###### of die individual.

37. The Bill is, contrary to Lord Hoffman’s well-known judgment, and as outlined above, riddled

with generality and ambiguity. It incorporates a disingenuous attempt by its drafters to state an

affinity for freedom of speech and expression, despite offering several mechanisms for those

rights to be curtailed. It is difficult to imagine how a Court will properly interpret the terms of

21 2 AC 115,131.

the Bill in the inevitable contests that would follow its passing, particularly in light of die

principle of legality.

**Recommendations:**

**9.** **The** **drafters** **of** **the** **Bill** **must** **be** **clear** **in** **their** **intentions.** **At** **present,** **the**

**Guidance** **Note** **and** **the** **Fact** **Sheet** **say** **one** **thing** **whilst** **the** **functionality** **of**

**the** **Bill** **suggests** **something** **else.** **This** **will** **result** **in** **complex** **and** **costly**

**litigation;**

**10.** **If** **the** **Bill** **is** **to** **be** **allowed** **to** **pass,** **stronger** **protections** **for** **free** **speech** **must**

###### be incorporated into it, which would require a drastic re-drafting of the Bill.

 Anything less should not be allowed, because freedom of speech and

**expression** **are** **such** **fundamental** **rights** **in** **our** **democracy.**

###### The Bill allows ACMA too much Power

38. On its current construction, die Bill allows ACMA inappropriate power:

a. First, it allows ACMA to unliterally govern die digital content creation space by creating

rules, codes and standards which every single producer of content on the internet must

comply with; and

b. Second, it turns ACMA into a quasi-judicial body capable of holding what are essentially

‘misinformation hearings’ involving other quasi-judicial powers such as die forced

production of evidence.

39. With respect to die former, it is rare that a piece of legislation allows a Government body

unchecked authority to create enforceable rules without any meaningful checks and balances in

place. The reason for this is demonstrated by the Bill’s current construction. On current

construction, if die Bill is passed, ACMA could create and then enforce rules, codes and

standards that contain anything ACMA wants; without oversight, and without the ability for

users of digital platforms, or those platforms themselves, to question or challenge those rules

(unless ACMA decides to incorporate these mechanisms within those rules, codes or standards).

The provision of this arbitrary rule making authority subverts representative democracy while

granting ACMA a head of power not found under die Constitution.

40. Although the Guidance Note and Fact Sheet, and elements of die Bill’s construction, suggest

###### that ACMA’s creation of codes and standards would only apply in circumstances where the

industry does not sufficiently regulate itself, this is, again, not how die Bill actually works.

ACMA, for example, is given audiority by die Bill to simply choose not to register a code which

industry creates.22 In addition, if ACMA in its sole discretion determines that a code created by

industry is “deficient”, it can simply create its own codes and standards. A code is “deficient if,

and only if, die code is not operating to provide adequate protection of the community from

misinformation or disinformation on die services”.23 Again, this is an amorphous definition

which essentially allows ACMA unfettered discretion to unilaterally declare a code deficient,

based on a definition of ‘misinformation’ that is already itself broken. This is further

exacerbated by die additional power that die Bill grants ACMA to “determine standards [in]

emerging circumstances”; that is, that ACMA only needs to consider it “necessary **or**

###### convenient” (emphasis added) to create standards “in order to provide adequate protection for

the community from misinformation or disinformation on the services”.24 The use of the word

###### “convenient” betrays die intent of die drafters; die discretion offered to ACMA is designed to

be as broad, and as difficult to challenge, as possible. The test, in its current drafting, is basically

meaningless.

41. Of additional concern are die quasi-judicial powers that Division 3 of the Bill, innocuously tided

“information gathering" grants to ACMA. Apart from allowing ACMA to, in any circumstance

where it “considers that it requires the information”, require a “digital platform provider” (recall

the scope of that definition) to provide to ACMA any “information, documents or evidence” it

desires,25 it also allows ACMA to force an individual “to appear before the ACMA at a time and

place specified in die notice to give any such evidence, either orally or in writing, and produce

any such documents”, at risk of civil penalty for non-compliance.26 That is, on any reading, a

subpoena power designed to force individuals (and representatives of corporations) to provide

written and oral evidence on demand. There is no concession for any potential breaches of die

state or federal privacy statutes, and die Bill even goes so far as to ensure that “an individual is

###### not excused from giving information or evidence or producing a document or a copy of a

document under this Division on the ground that giving the information or evidence or

producing the document or copy might tend to incriminate the individual in relation to an

offence”.27 That is, even the protections available to defendants in the criminal charge and

hearing process are not afforded to digital platform providers (which again, can be individuals)

###### under this Bill. The provision of this unbounded quasi-judicial authority subverts the rule of law

and common law rights, while granting to ACMA a star chamber-like authority not afforded

###### under the Constitution.

42. These powers are, in their current form, a clear attempt to wrap an iron fist around the sharing

###### of information online by forcing content creators to front up and provide evidence before a

murky Government body with an incredible and unprecedented degree of discretion to mete

###### out civil and criminal penalties. It is a threat wrapped in a regulatory nightmare; and it

completely ignores the legislative protections for the sharing of private information that already

exist in Australia.28

**Recommendations:**

**11.** **Stronger** **checks** **and** **balances** **need** **to** **be** **incorporated** **into** **the** **Bill** **such** **that**

**ACMA** **is** **not** **allowed** **unchecked,** **unilateral,** **unchallenged** **power** **to** **create**

###### codes, rules and standards;

**12.** **Statutory** **mechanisms** **for** **review** **and** **challenge** **of** **ACMA** **decisions** **must** **be**

**incorporated** **into** **the** **Bill,** **with** **external** **and** **independent** **oversight** **that** **is**

###### timely and efficient;

**13.** **ACMA’s** **discretion** **should** **be** **limited** **and** **couched** **within** **clear** **parameters**

**for** **reasonable** **assessment** **by** **a** **Court;**

**14.** **The** **Bill** **must** **include** **a** **Clause** **excepting** **the** **provision** **of** **any** **information**

**that** **would** **render** **the** **provider** **in** **breach** **of** **Privacy** **legislation.**

###### C. Conclusion

43. When the public is no longer the arbiter of truth, and that role becomes usurped by bureaucrats

and governments, history suggests that the resultant censorship erodes the public's collective

###### trust in authority.

44. In its current form, not only is die Bill unworkable and illogical, but it betrays a fundamental

lack of understanding, or lack of care, for die human rights of Australians; and in particular for

the right to freedom of speech and expression. It is unlikely that minor amendments will be

enough to save this Bill. Its sponsors provide no evidence to justify die intrusions it proposes

###### into die private and civil autonomy of Australian citizens, whilst purporting to vest unrestrained

investigatory, quasi-judicial and non-reviewable policing power into a body without

Constitutional authority. Should such laws be enacted there is little doubt that complex litigation

will ensue. The impact on die Australian legal system could prove to be detrimental to die

administration of die entire legal system.

45. As it stands, we fundamentally and vehemently oppose this Bill. If such law is allowed to pass, it

will not only signal die death knell of die internet as a free marketplace of ideas in Australia, but

###### it will signal to Australian citizens, and to citizens of die globe, that die Australian Government

seeks total control of die dissemination of information within its borders, and that such control

is more valuable to that Government than die individual rights of its citizenry. That would be a

dark day for democracy indeed, were such a thing to pass.
