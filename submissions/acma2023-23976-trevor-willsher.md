**My submission against the “Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.”**

I hereby provide my submission on this proposed Bill, to voice my opposition to its
imposition. Given Australia’s experience and that of the whole world over the last 3
years, I find it abhorrent that the Government is seeking to impose even greater
censorship of dissenting voices. During the pandemic, these dissenting voices came
from all walks of life, all professions, including but not limited to Doctors, Scientists,
Medical Specialists, Vaccinologists, Virologists, Data experts, Politicians, Media
commentators, Policy experts and many many more. These people were cancelled,
vilified, blocked, mocked, and even physically attacked if they spoke up, even with the
knowledge that doing so could potentially end their careers, their livelihoods and
possibly even their lives.

For the Federal Government to come out, on George Orwell’s birthday of all days, and
announce they plan to introduce a “Ministry of Truth”, irony aside, smacks of arrogance.
To introduce this ‘Ministry of Truth’ via the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) also indicates a cynical side and shows the direction planned for
Australia. This bill appears to have Communist overtones and is representative of the
way everyday Australians are viewed by the Government of the day, it clearly
demonstrates contempt for our Constitutional Guarantees and for what our original
framers intended for this great Nation at Federation.

To say that a government agency (ACMA) will be afforded the power to become the
absolute arbiter of truth, is an insult to the intelligence of everyday Australians. That
ACMA will decide what information the Australian people can and cannot have access
to, that they can decide what content is mis and/or dis information will mean that
Scientific debate is dead and not only that, in some incidences, criminalised. Consider
how dangerous and deadly this approach has already proven to be, over the last 3
years, with the following Government approved narratives subsequently turning out to
be either false or partly false and subsequently causing harm.

  - _Ivermectin, a Nobel Prize winning medication, with a very impressive safety_
profile, was originally banned by the TGA in March 2020, despite being used
for the last 50 years, including off label use to treat Coronaviruses, without
concern. Anyone pointing this out and advocating its use against Covid 19 was
treated as an enemy, even a domestic terrorist and ridiculed by the media and
talking heads alike. After the pandemic, Ivermectin was subsequently declared
safe and effective (again) at treating Covid 19. How many lives could’ve been
saved in the early days of the pandemic had it not been banned, and the
dissenters taken seriously. The question also has to be asked, if Ivermectin
were not banned and instead used to effectively treat Covid 19 symptoms,
where would that leave the requirement for a novel untried and largely untested
vaccine?. It would completely negate the justification for vaccine mandates (if
one even existed). Exactly the same could be said for Hydroxychloroquine.

  - _‘2 weeks to flatten the curve’ In the early stages of the pandemic, we were told_
that we’d be locked down for only 2 weeks, to quote, ‘flatten the curve’ many
stated that this was just the beginning and lockdowns would likely continue for
years, or at least until the Jab became available, which turned out to be true.
These people were again treated like they were spreading dangerous
conspiracy theory and were a danger to public health. Under these proposed
amendments, similar statements would likely be classed as mis and/or dis
information and possibly criminalised, even though they turned out to be true.

  - _The mRNA jabs. The Covid vaccinations were originally slated as being 95%_
effective at preventing transmission and infection of the Sars Cov2 virus, again
anyone who stated differently, and who had evidence to substantiate their
claim, was silenced and vilified. This message was pushed relentlessly through
the media, through workplaces, through Hospitals and Drs surgeries. Many
experts including Doctors and Scientists challenged this narrative, often to their
detriment. It later turned out this claim was mis information, as we subsequently
learnt from themselves that they (Vaccines) were never tested for

stopping transmission or infection of the Sars Cov2 virus.

  - _Lockdowns Lockdowns were considered an effective tool at stopping the_
spread of the virus and those experts who questioned this strategy claiming
lockdowns would likely cause more harm than good were cancelled. It is now
widely acknowledged that lockdowns caused way more harm than they
prevented, and led to businesses being closed, people losing their livelihoods,
their jobs, even their lives. Peoples’ medical conditions went undiagnosed,
which will cost millions if not billions of dollars and countless lives in the longer
term. Adding to that, in the aftermath our health system has been thrown into
total chaos. If only we’d allowed the dissenters to speak and listened to what
evidence, they were presenting, The Great Barrington Declaration is a prime
example of what we could have done better, but it was banned and slammed
in the media and under this Bill would likely be classed as dis information.

  - _The mRNA vaccines were touted as safe and effective and heavily promoted_
as such, when there was no medium to long term studies to support this thesis,
adding to that ’s own internal documents on the short-term studies

indicated major issues with safety and efficacy. There is now clear evidence
that these vaccines are causing widespread harm, likely contributing to an
increase in excess mortality of close to 20% over the long-term average. An
issue by the way that this same Government is refusing to investigate, I wonder
why that might be (if you don’t go looking, you will not find). Are we to continue
on without allowing this evidence to be made public and debated in an
appropriate forum? It is also now widely accepted that it is the heavily
vaccinated that are still being impacted by recurring and increasingly more
virulent Covid infections, placing enormous pressure on our hospital systems.

All the above points that formed part of the official pandemic narrative seemingly turned
out to be false. It’s the Mainstream media outlets, that failed to accurately inform the
public, that now have egg on their collective faces. They are all subsequently losing
viewers hand over fist and scrambling to claw back any semblance of credibility and
relevance. You just have to look at Tucker Carlson’s viewer numbers since being fired
by Sky News and commencing his own show on Twitter. Tuckers first show attracted
70 million views, figures that Sky News could only dream about. It’s clear the public
have had enough of being lied to and now have a thirst for truth. It’s obvious that


-----

Governments and Mainstream media are now terrified of alternative media sources
and terrified they are revealing the truth to an audience now open to accepting
alternatives to the Government narrative. This is obvious when you consider every
Western nation around the world is now pushing similar censorship legislation, to
effectively gag dissenters and criminalise those that provide them a voice. There is a
saying by George RR Martin, ‘When you tear out a man’s tongue you are not proving
him a liar, you’re only telling the world that you fear what he has to say’.

In fact a recent Federal Court decision in the US, goes straight to the heart of where
this Bill will take Australia. In his 155-page ruling, in the Case of Missouri V Biden,
Judge Terry Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana
Monroe Division said ‘there is “substantial evidence” the government violated the First
_Amendment by engaging in a large-scale censorship campaign targeting content that_
_questioned or countered establishment narratives on COVID-19._

_Doughty said the “evidence produced thus far depicts an almost dystopian scenario.”_


_He added:_


_“If the allegations made by Plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the_
_most massive attack against free speech in United States’ history. In their attempts to_
_suppress alleged disinformation, the Federal Government, and particularly the_
_Defendants named here, are alleged to have blatantly ignored the First Amendment’s_
_right to free speech. …_

_“During the COVID-19 pandemic, a period perhaps best characterized by widespread_
_doubt and uncertainty, the United States Government seems to have assumed a role_
_similar to an Orwellian ‘Ministry of Truth.’”_

In Australia and around the world, the mainstream media outlets clearly all acted in
Lockstep during the pandemic, which it could be argued was due to the massive,
alleged tax breaks they received for following the narrative. As a result, the MSM
refused to entertain any dissenting voices, no matter their qualifications, no alternative
views were provided, indeed they were actively mocked and cancelled. This left these
experts no other option, but to turn to alternative and social media outlets. These
outlets who provided this medium for information (that subsequently turned out to be
true), will be the same outlets targeted by these amendments. This Bill amounts to
nothing more than censorship by coercion (threat of huge fines), more akin to the
actions of the Communist Regimes of China and North Korea, and not the so-called
democracy of Australia.

Another such outlet that has reliably reported on the truth about Vaccinations since
2016 and later the Pandemic itself is ‘The Highwire’ produced by the Informed Consent
Action Network (ICAN). ICAN have, through their Attorney Aaron Siri, successfully
sued US Government agencies on multiple occasions, including the CDC, FDA, NIH
and more. If it was not for Aaron Siri successfully suing Pfizer and the FDA, Pfizer
would have been allowed to keep its Covid Vaccination trial study results secret for 75
years, and we would never have known the truth. Every single issue reported on the
Highwire can be substantiated by the evidence that they provide to the viewers every
single week, despite this it was banned from Facebook and kicked off Youtube. An
outlet that is fully funded by the people, has successfully sued the Government multiple
times and that provides the evidence for every claim it makes, does this sound like the
achievements of a fake news organisation to you, I would challenge anyone to find any
untruths in the material they report. Its these outlets that I believe now present a risk


-----

to the status quo, the mainstream media and the Government which is why this type
of legislation is being pushed worldwide

Now imagine a situation where this Bill had been in place 3 years ago and the
pandemic had occurred with these draconian reporting restrictions in place. This would
have created an environment with absolutely no checks and balances on Government
policy. No mechanism to hold any Government official, Health Bureaucrat or Media
outlet to account for misleading the population. We’d now have a situation where we
would all be required to prove our vaccination status in order to access the basics of
life, we’d all have to possess a Digital Health passport to prove we are “healthy” enough
to be able to participate in society. I experienced a snippet of what this life would look
like during our draconian lockdowns in, trust me it’s not a life we want to pursue.

Adding to this, we’d likely be on about booster number 10 by now, with all the negative
health consequences that would likely come with that, and we be in our 3[rd] year of ‘two
weeks to flatten the curve’ style rolling lockdowns.

I agree that the public needs to be protected from dangerous mis and dis information
as it has clearly proven deadly over the course of the pandemic. However, it could
credibly be argued that the sources for this mis/disinformation were those that are to
be exempted from the provisions of this Bill. To have any credibility, these standards
need to apply to all sources of information and news, including the Mainstream media
and the Government itself. For these amendments not to apply to the very
organisations that have been proven to spread mis information especially during the
Covid era, smacks of hypocrisy and vested interests. If the plan is for Australia to
become a Communist dictatorship, then at least the Government should be honest
with the Australian people about their intentions. Unless all media outlets and sources
of information are held to the same standards of truth, transparency, and
accountability, then it’s just more indication of the slow creep towards tyranny that the
so called “Conspiracy theorists” have been warning us about for the last few decades.
Agencies that should also be captured by these amendments, include our regulatory
agencies who failed miserably during and after the pandemic, Agencies including the
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) The Australian Health Practitioners
Regulatory Agency (AHPRA) and our so-called Employment protection agencies such
as the Fair Work Commission and the Industrial Relations Commission, all who appear
to be hopelessly compromised and captured by industry and Government and rely on
Government approved information to decide outcomes of their hearings. We need real
market forces to keep agencies honest and ensure integrity in reporting of information,
these amendments will do the exact opposite, they will remove the ability to challenge
and hold these agencies to account.

There are countless incidences over the centuries when what is considered to be truth
today turns out to be false tomorrow and plenty of perceived falsehoods that
subsequently turned out to be true, it’s what science is all about. Instead of a ‘Ministry
of Truth’ peddling the Government narrative and throwing any conflicting information
in the shredder as Winston’s peers so obediently did in 1984, we need to preserve
freedom of speech and have open debates on the issues that matter. We need these
debates with experts from both sides to allow us, the people, to discern our own truth.
What our government is planning with these amendments is a direct attack on the
principles embedded in our Constitution and conflict with what our framers intended
for this great nation at Federation. These amendments are also an immeasurable insult
to our diggers and what they fought and died for.

Sadly, it would appear, Australia has lost its way, lost its morality, lost its spirituality
and lost it’s can do, fair go approach to life’s challenges. We have allowed the
overarching influence of big Government to capture and control every aspect of our

lives. This Bill, by design will cut off all avenues for legitimately holding our
governments to account for any future overstep, any future attempt to remove even
more rights and freedoms. A process that is ultimately doomed to failure, as history will
show, history will also be very unkind to the enablers, peddlers and designers of this
(and other) attempts at further eroding the rights of Australians. These actions will be
embedded in our consciousness until the time when the inevitable happens and people
rise and say enough is enough however this unfortunate outcome transpires, hopefully
we do not emulate the actions of the French, who have clearly been pushed to the
brink by their governments’ overreach.

I firmly believe this to be a very dangerous Bill which presents the most serious threat
to not only the freedom of every Australian, but also to our way of life. Given the post
pandemic health crisis Australia is now facing, it may also present a serious risk to our
health and safety, the very thing they say they want to protect. It’s for all the above
reasons that I firmly oppose this Bill, I oppose it primarily for my kid’s generation, my
future grandkids generation and all future generations. The answer to our Country’s
wows, that have largely been created by Big Government is not more of the same
(Bigger Government), its remembering who we are, and demanding Government get
out of our lives and back to its job of protecting us from the ravages of greedy
corporations and not the other way round.

Now lastly, for anyone that’s still reading, thanks for hanging in till the end, I want to
finish off by looking at some of the most important issues of 2023 and the most likely
impact of dealing with these issues, without the freedom to explore all sides of the story
and instead rely solely on the Government approved narrative.

  - _The Voice - An attempt to re-write our constitution without providing any details_
to the Australian people, essentially, we are being asked to provide the
Government with a blank signed cheque. Then blindly trust the Government to
do what is right for the Australian people with said cheque. All without the ability
to question their intentions and motives.

  - _Net Zero - A push to totally redesign our energy landscape, causing massive_
disruption and financial pain on everyday Australians, all based on the idea that

(a) Man is Creating too much Carbon Dioxide (Co2)
(b) This Co2 is causing the planet to warm and threaten our survival.

Many experts around the world have already been silenced on this issue.
Despite the claims to the contrary, there certainly does not exist any consensus
on this issue, if consensus does in fact exist, it’s because dissenting voices
have been silenced, which just gives the false impression that consensus
exists. Following is an example of a simple fact that would be classed as
misinformation because it conflicts with the official Government narrative, yet it
is 100% true and easily verifiable, check for yourself, it’ll take you ten minutes,
max.

1. Current number of trees in the world = 3 trillion
2. Average amount of Co2 each tree sequesters every year = 0.025 Metric tonnes
3. Amount of manmade Co2 released into the atmosphere every year = 35 Billion

metric tonnes

4. The inconvenient truth is, Simple math produces the following Net result - Trees

sequester 75,000,000,000 metric tonnes of Co2 each year, over 2 x times more
than man allegedly produces, we’re already well beyond Net zero, by a factor
of 2, if that’s not good enough, plant more trees.

  - _Banning of cash and the introduction of digital currency - Governments_
worldwide are making moves to ban cash payments and transition to
Digital/programmable currency. A move that would give them absolute and total
control over every citizen, every purchase monitored, every penny spent would
be tracked and traced, they would even have the ability to switch off access to
your account, should you say something the Government does not approve of.

To again quote Judge Terry Doughty in the Missouri v Biden case mentioned earlier,
he stated ‘that the actions of the US Government in censoring dissent (during Covid)
_presented probably the most serious assault on Liberty and Freedom in peacetime_
_America’_

This Bill should not be viewed any differently in Australia as it seeks to bring about the
same outcome. This Bill is clearly at odds with a free, democratic and civil society and
any politician in support of it forever loses the right to claim they stand for a free and
civil Australia and will be remembered as such.
