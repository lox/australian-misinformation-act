Dear Authority Members,

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 is an insulting piece of legislations that politicians should have known better than introduce
into the Australian parliament.

This proposed amendment indicates that Australian politician from the Labor Party have a
dangerous distain for free speech and democracy.

I object to the Australia Communications and Media Authority or the State, Federal or local
government proposing to restrict free speech.

During the pandemic politicians and so-called experts were the main source of misinformation and
disinformation which has resulted in a 15% excess death rate.

Examples government endorsed misinformation/disinformation:

# • Masks stop the transmission of the virus. Apparently so- called experts don't know the size
of the virus.

# • The COVID vaccine would stop transmission.

 • The virus originated close to medical research laboratory but was not

During the pandemic The Department of Home Affairs had requested the censorship of 4,213
COVID-related social media posts. Now so much of what was censored has been proven to be
correct/accurate.

I would expect this type of legislation to occur in communist countries like China. Need I say more

Stop the government overreach.

Regards

Jocelyn Harte
