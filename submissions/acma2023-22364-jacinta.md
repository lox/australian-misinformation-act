# MISINFORMATION & DISINFORMATION BILL

I consider this bill to be a complete overreach by the Australian Government into my right to
Free Speech.

According to the “Universal Declarafion of Human Rights” which was adopted by the UN on
December 10[th] 1948 (to which Australia is a signatory), under Arficle 19 of the said
Declarafion it states “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
**right includes Freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and**
**impart informafion and ideas through any media and regardless of Fronfiers”.**
The above Declarafion was brought in to stop this sort of silencing of the public by
Governments.

The Australian Government should not be using this type of Communisfic/Dictatorial
aftitude and behaviour towards the Australian public (this is the type of behaviour one see’s
in countries such as ‘North Korea or China’).

This Tyrannical aftitude and treatment of the Australian people should never be allowed to
enter into our lives, it is oppressive and undemocrafic, completely the opposite to what
Australia has always stood for.
Do not tell me that this Bill is not oppressive, because it is taking away my right to reply
against that which I do not agree to which the Australian government is aftempfing to
impose on me. This Government should be encouraging ‘Open and Honest public
discussions on all items that affect the Australian People’.

The quesfion that needs to asked is “what are they (the government) afraid of, why do they
want to stop the Australian public from quesfioning them”.
