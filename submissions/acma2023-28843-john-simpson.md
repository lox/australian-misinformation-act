I am opposed to the “New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation”. I believe
these new powers “pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our
democracy, society and economy.” No government can be trusted to decide the truth. It is obvious
that those in power work to maintain that power, often by criticising any opposing opinion. humanity
is evolving into a more compassionate and environmentally conscious being. Part of this transition is
allowing people to take responsibility for what they think. In other words, allowing people to become
adults and grow up, while the “parent government” takes a less controlling role. Freedom of speech
and freedom of thought are essential for the future development of humanity and to avoid slavery
on a grand scale. If you give a government enough power they will become essentially a dictatorship.
In a dictatorship the only person allowed to think for themselves is the ruler. To reach our potential
Humanity requires not one person to think, but all persons to think. Don’t tell people what to think,
allow them to think. Is the government afraid to defend its ideology? The flat earth is a great
example, and an opportunity for people to learn about shadows created by the sun that reveal why
smart people in the past concluded the earth is round. This can be done without demonising anyone,
and everyone learns something. Governments are simply obsessed with maintaining their power and
to that end, they seek to outlaw all dissent. I think it’s time for everyone to grow up including
governments.
