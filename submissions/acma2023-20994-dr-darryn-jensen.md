**Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**_Disinformation) Bill 2023_**

My submission is that the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
_Disinformation) Bill 2023 should not be enacted in its current form. My reasons for opposing the Bill_
are as follows:
1. The Bill contemplates that a government authority will decide what is ‘misinformation’ and
‘disinformation’ and assumes that a single decision-maker can infallibly determine what is true
and what is false, misleading or deceptive. This is inconsistent with the notion that Australia
is a ‘free’ and ‘egalitarian’ society. In a free society, truth should be sorted from fiction by
allowing a free exchange of information and ideas, so that ‘truth’ is the product of the
accumulation of many individual judgements about the validity of that information and those
ideas. The validity of information and ideas can be tested by comparison with other
information and ideas that circulate freely. No individual or organisation is to be set up as an
infallible arbiter as to what is true because no individual or organisation is infallible in that
regard. In an egalitarian society, equal respect is shown to each and every person by allowing
the communication of honestly held beliefs and opinions, including honestly mistaken beliefs
and opinions.
2. The definitions of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ extend beyond material that is
demonstrably false to include material that is ‘misleading’ or ‘deceptive’ – see paragraphs
7(1)(a) and 7(2)(a) of the proposed Schedule 9 - which potentially includes information that is
true on its face but is captured by the defintion on the basis of a judgement in the individual
case that a lack of context (or similar) might have the effect that some people are misled or
deceived (even if most or many people are not).
3. For material to be ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’, it is enough that ‘the provision of
the content … is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm’ [italics added] – see
paragraphs 7(1)(d) and 7(2)(d) of the proposed Schedule 9. There is an attempt to define
‘serious harm’ in subclause 7(3) but this is not an exhaustive definition. It seems to be
contemplated that the matters listed in the subclause would be ‘weighed’ in a fairly
unstructured way by the decision-maker. ‘Harm’ is given a very broad definition in clause 2
that includes, notably, ‘disruption to public order or society in Australia’ [italics added]. This
would appear not to be limited to the incitement of public violence or civil commotion.
4. Any uncertainty as to what might be characterised as ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’
encourages providers of digital platforms to err on the side of caution by developing
excessively restrictive policies as to what material may be disseminated on their platform. The
result may be a ‘freezing’ of legitimate discourse on matters of public policy and other matters
of public interest.

The Bill, as currently framed, effectively confers power on a government body to decide, within very
broad parameters, what constitues ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ and to impose significant
penalties on digital platform providers for allowing the dissemination of information so characterised.
For this reason alone, the Bill should be rejected. If the Bill is to be enacted, this should occur only
after significant amendments to the definitions of ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’, ‘harm’ and
‘serious harm’.
