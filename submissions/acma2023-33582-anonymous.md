# Misinformation/Disinformation bill

I am Federal Electorate constituent, and I am writing to express my profound concern

regarding the proposed Misinformation/Disinformation bill.

There are so many seriously alarming facets to this bill.

Misinformation and Disinformation can only be deemed to occur after some "truth" has been
"decided".

Keeping in mind this need to define a truth to determine mis/disinformation, I will list a few of the
many points with potentially worrying ramifications that accompany this proposed Bill.

Firstly, that the government of the day will determine what is deemed to be the truth (that is, the
"correct" information), and ACMA will enforce compliance with this "so called" truth in online
communications, so as to avoid "serious harm".

In our current pluralistic society, academics often argue that "there is not just one version of truth".
If that is the case, as most in a progressive government would probably believe, how will the
Government determine what is the "particular truth" that is to be enforced? Will it be dependent on
the ruling dominant ideology of the time?

Surely truth can only come from the free, open, and robust contest of ideas in the open
marketplace? Or are we to go back to the times of The Inquisition or McCarthyism, but just with a
different powerful and intolerant ideology in charge?

Further, the determination of what should be classed as "misinformation" is fraught, because of the
natural evolution of knowledge itself.

In my work as a medical practitioner, I conscientiously advised patients of the medical advice that
was current, thought (and taught) to be accurate at the time (for example, on the nutritional
management of Type 2 Diabetes in the early 1980s). That medical advice is now superseded because
it was challenged. As many of the accepted medical "truths" from the 1980s have now been
superseded.

But if new research had been curtailed because it was labelled "misinformation", how would we
have moved onwards in medicine?
Further, it should be noted that the most impressive doctors that taught and mentored my cohort in
my career, frequently said that "there is no such thing as a dumb question". That the science "is
never settled". And in the search for truth, "sunlight is the best disinfectant".

Censorship has no rightful place in the pursuit of truth in Science. And I believe, in the search for
### truth generally.

Science has only truly flourished where people are free to question accepted "ways of thinking".
We can only move forward as a civilisation if we are always questioning, and never closing our minds
to other ways of doing or thinking. And how can we be a nation of lifelong learners if we are only
allowed to be exposed to "truths" that have been decided by faceless bureaucrats or activists?

And significantly, doesn't the Albanese Government respect the Australian population's own agency
to determine the truth?

And what are the government's, indeed, ANY government's, qualifications to be the arbiters of
truth? To allow a bill like the one proposed, would hand censorship power.... to whom? Academics
at Universities? Journalists? Bureaucrats? Parliamentarians?

And there is another matter deep at the heart of a flaw with this proposed bill. We all have our
biases, as we are human. And humanity's natural (and seemingly increasing) inclination is to
demonise those with opposing views. This human inclination will make this bill more likely to be
abused than perhaps it's well-intentioned proponents can foresee.

As an example, in recent months, a very influential, senior journalist from our national broadcaster
admitted that he himself, on an issue of international importance that had previously been widely
dismissed as "misinformation" in some of the press, was "overly influenced by the fact it was truly
nasty, crazy people who were so deep down the rabbit hole. I probably didn't look at it

dispassionately enough". As he admitted, "You can be unhinged and still be right."
And yet the^^Bjournalist admitted that he hadn't looked at the issue "dispassionately enough"
despite the^^^^Bbroadcaster even having a dedicated "fact checking department".

And that goes to a core problem with this proposed bill. People that we approve of, that look, or
vote, or "think" like us, do not have a monopoly on truth. Yet we are all human, and often we do not
want people or groups that we find repugnant to be correct. Thus, it is not a great step from thinking
that people are "unhinged", to thinking that their beliefs and views must also be "unhinged", and
hence deciding that those beliefs and views must be stamped out.
And that human inclination appears to be stronger than any supposed protection offered by a "fact
checking department".
Indeed, a "fact checking department" may not be dispassionate either.

Further, this Misinformation/Disinformation Bill would empower the Media Watchdog (ACMA) to
regulate online communication based on whether it could cause harm. Causing harm is an extremely
subjective entity. Almost any communication could be seen to be able to cause harm if harm is being
sought. Offense and harm can often be claimed, when really there is just disagreement.

The claim of misinformation/disinformation "causing harm" could easily be weaponised by powerful
lobby groups to shut down legitimate debate, thereby creating a chilling effect on free speech in this
country.

In a truly diverse, tolerant, and inclusive society, there should be room for diversity of opinions, and
beliefs. Freedom of expression should not be held hostage to the prevailing dominant ideology.

And also, what specific qualifications do the unelected members of the media watchdog have to
arbitrate whether specific communications legitimately cause harm?

In summary, our nation's search for the truth is too important to be placed at the mercy and whim
of Government, bureaucracy, and Big Tech.

Censorship of what is "deemed" Misinformation or Disinformation by ACMA and Big Tech, will stifle
debate on important issues, and stymie scrutiny of powerful players.


-----

There is no way to quarantine the effects of such a Bill while preserving free speech. Big Tech will
almost certainly pre-emptively curtail the expression of some views and news so as to avoid financial
penalties.

The ramifications of such a Bill are too far reaching to coexist amicably with the freedom that our
Diggers fought and died for.

This Bill should be rejected in its entirety.

Thank you for considering my submission.
