To whom it may concern,
As an Australian citizen, one who was born in another country, but chose to make Australia her home because it was
such an amazing, free country, I am appalled by the current governments move to ban free speech. And yes, that is
what they are hoping to do. What is truth? These days it has become whatever the person with the loudest voice
and the most power says it is. Daily the newspapers, owned by just a few tell us what to believe. The nightly news
only tell us the stories they want us to focus on, also decided by a powerful few. I, and many I know no longer watch
the news or read their papers. We talk, pass around ideas amongst ourselves and others who make up our world.
Sometimes we learn something new, sometimes we disagree, sometimes we completely change our point of view.
Because we can. Because we have to opportunity in this country to do so. We can talk about religion ( all kinds,
child rearing, healthcare, whether our government is good or bad. However, if this government brings in these laws
they choose what we can talk about. They can skew the country towards whatever agenda those few people have.
Not everyone will believe them. But without free speech and no censorship those that take everything they hear at
face value will no longer be given the opportunity to hear a different point of view.
Imagine a nation 50 years ago. The tobacco companies made large donations to a certain in power political party.
The government in return never spoke of the dangers of smoking. Lung cancer was just bad luck, or didn’t exist at
all. People carried on smoking in their homes, around their children because if it was bad wouldn’t someone say
something. And perhaps doctors had. Many of them. But they were shut down. Not allowed to share their findings
because it didn’t suit the government’s agenda. Or it could have been asbestos. Or the new jabs foisted upon this
nation recently. All have turned out to cause severe health issues (the jab injuries are beginning to be spoken about
with the Victorian government facing large claims against it for injuries)
And who exactly makes a decision on what is true and what is not. I see some outrageous claims being made these
days. I don’t want people like that controlling the nations information . We aren’t China. We are a free nation, or we
were. Don’t allow this government or any in the future decide what you have to believe, or your children for that
matter

Your sincerely
Rebecca Pater
