# Please Protect Freedom of Speech in Australia

I STRONGLY believe that FREEDOM OF SPEECH is an essential human right and a fundamental principle of Australian
democracy. I express my deep concern regarding the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, introduced by the Labor Party, which I believe represents a direct attack on_
**FREEDOM OF SPEECH.** **I assert the following:-_**

**Subjective Definition of Misinformation: The bill's highly subjective definition of "misinformation" grants the government**
arbitrary power to determine what constitutes misinformation. This opens the door to the suppression of legitimate criticisms
of the government, questioning of scientific ideologies such as climate change, immigration policies, gender dysphoria, and
opposition to a voice in Parliament.

**Draconian Powers of ACMA: The bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with**
draconian powers to silence critics of the government. It allows for fines of up to $6.8 million to be imposed on social media
platforms if, in ACMA's opinion, they have not done enough to prevent the dissemination of what ACMA considers to be
misinformation or disinformation. This creates a chilling effect on free expression and inhibits open dialogue.

**Protection of Government and Mainstream Media: The legislation carves out protections for government, mainstream**
media, and approved organizations, thereby creating an imbalance in the treatment of different voices and viewpoints. This not
only undermines the principle of equality of speech but also reinforces a two-party system at the expense of independent
media and non-government political parties.

**Essentially, this Bill means that, “misinformation” or “disinformation”, can mean anything the government wants it to mean**
and that people who disagree with the government cannot be allowed to share their views or organize information against
**the government anywhere on the internet. The population must be literally “kept in the dark” and only provided the**
government approved narrative, like communist North Korea and China etc.

Since March 2020 the many unscientific, unnecessary, ridiculous and often contradictory COVID regulations (including; mask
mandates, lockdowns, travel restrictions, forced vaccinations to work and suppression of safe and effective treatments so that
Vaccines could be pushed as the ONLY treatment to a MSM fear porn terrorized population) have taught us a valuable lesson.
**Government and Health departments and their experts are often wrong and with dire or even fatal consequences for many**
people and businesses. Current increased death and serious injury data from the highly vaxxed countries all around the world is
proving these facts. People should be allowed to do their own research from an unrestricted plethora of sources and discern what
is true, accurate and a valid course of action for their personal values, health and situation. We are after all, intelligent beings and
well able to think for ourselves !.In light of these concerns, I call on the Parliament to:
**Reject the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, recognizing**
that it poses a threat to freedom of speech in Australia.
**Safeguard the principles of freedom of speech and expression as cornerstones of Australian democracy, ensuring that all**
individuals, media outlets, and political parties are equally protected in exercising their right to free speech.
**Conduct a thorough review of the bill to address its subjective definition of misinformation and the imbalance in protections**
provided to different entities, aiming to foster a fair and inclusive environment for open public discourse.

**I call on all members of Parliament to heed my submission together with all the other submissions and petitions from concerned,**
freedom loving Australians, to listen to the concerns voiced and act in the best interests of upholding freedom of speech and
**protecting the individual rights of all current and future Australians.**

**Thank you for your attention to this matter.**
