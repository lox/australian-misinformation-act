This is an insult to every person's intelligence to discern for themselves what is true information and what is misinformation.

No government has a monopoly of what is truth - isn't that the whole point of elections and democracy for the people to decide
who they trust and if those they trust prove to be untrustworthy they can be voted out of office? This proposed legislation is
totalitarianism in disguise.

It is an attack on freedom of speech which our forebears fought sacrificially for and which the next generation will be denied.

It is unnecessary, invasive and unaustralian.
