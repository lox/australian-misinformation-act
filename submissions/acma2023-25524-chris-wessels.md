# Will covid-19 vaccines save lives? Current trials aren’t designed to tell us

### The world has bet the farm on vaccines as the solution to the pandemic, but the trials are not focused on answering the questions many might assume they are. Peter Doshi reports

 Peter Doshi associate editor


As phase III trials of covid-19 vaccines reach their
target enrolments, officials have been trying to project
calm. The US coronavirus czar Anthony Fauci and
the Food and Drug Administration leadership have
offeredpublicassurancesthatestablishedprocedures
will be followed.[1 -4] Only a “safe and effective”
vaccine will be approved, they say, and nine vaccine
manufacturers issued a rare joint statement pledging
not to prematurely seek regulatory review.[5]

But what will it mean exactly when a vaccine is
declared “effective”? To the public this seems fairly
obvious. “The primary goal of a covid-19 vaccine is
to keep people from getting very sick and dying,” a
National Public Radio broadcast said bluntly.[6]


Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical
Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
said, “Ideally, you want an antiviral vaccine to do
two things . . . first, reduce the likelihood you will get
severely ill and go to the hospital, and two, prevent
infection and therefore interrupt disease
transmission.”[7]

Yet the current phase III trials are not actually set up
to prove either (table 1). None of the trials currently
under way are designed to detect a reduction in any
serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of
intensive care, or deaths. Nor are the vaccines being
studied to determine whether they can interrupt
transmission of the virus.

#### Evaluating mild, not severe, disease

In a September interview Medscape editor in chief Eric Topol
pondered what counts as a recorded “event” in the vaccine trials.
“We’re not talking about just a PCR [polymerase chain reaction
test]-positive mild infection. It has to be moderate to severe illness
to qualify as an event, correct?” he asked.[8]

“That’s right,” concurred his guest, Paul Offit, a vaccinologist who
sits on the FDA advisory committee that may ultimately recommend
the vaccines for licence or emergency use authorisation.

But that’s not right. In all the ongoing phase III trials for which
details have been released, laboratory confirmed infections even
with only mild symptoms qualify as meeting the primary endpoint
definition.[9 -12] In Pfizer and Moderna’s trials, for example, people
with only a cough and positive laboratory test would bring those
trials one event closer to their completion. (If AstraZeneca’s ongoing
UK trial is designed similarly to its “paused” US trial for which the
company has released details, a cough and fever with positive PCR
test would suffice.)

Part of the reason may be numbers. Severe illness requiring hospital
admission, which happens in only a small fraction of symptomatic
covid-19 cases would be unlikely to occur in significant numbers


in trials. Data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in late April reported a symptomatic case hospitalisation
ratio of 3.4% overall, varying from 1.7% in 0-49 year olds and 4.5%
in 50-64 year olds to 7.4% in those 65 and over.[13] Because most
peoplewithsymptomaticcovid-19experienceonlymildsymptoms,[14]

even trials involving 30 000 or more patients would turn up
relatively few cases of severe disease.

In the trials, final efficacy analyses are planned after just 150 to 160
“events,”—that is, a positive indication of symptomatic covid-19,
regardless of severity of the illness.

Yet until vaccine manufacturers began to release their study
protocols in mid-September, trial registries and other publicly
released information did little to dispel the notion that it was severe
covid-19 that the trials were assessing. Moderna, for example, called
hospital admissions a “key secondary endpoint” in statements to
the media.[15] And a press release from the US National Institutes of
Health reinforced this impression, stating that Moderna’s trial “aims
to study whether the vaccine can prevent severe covid-19” and
“seeks to answer if the vaccine can prevent death caused by
covid-19.”[16]

But Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna, told The BMJ that

outcomes. “The trial is precluded from judging [hospital
admissions], based on what is a reasonable size and duration to
serve the public good here,” he said.

Hospital admissions and deaths from covid-19 are simply too
uncommon in the population being studied for an effective vaccine
to demonstrate statistically significant differences in a trial of 30
000 people. The same is true of its ability to save lives or prevent
transmission: the trials are not designed to find out.

Zaks said, “Would I like to know that this prevents mortality? Sure,
because I believe it does. I just don’t think it’s feasible within the
timeframe [of the trial]—too many would die waiting for the results
before we ever knew that.”


#### Stopping transmission

What about Hotez’s second criterion, interrupting virus
transmission, which some experts have argued[17] should be the most
important test in phase III studies?

“Our trial will not demonstrate prevention of transmission,” Zaks
said, “because in order to do that you have to swab people twice a
week for very long periods, and that becomes operationally
untenable.”

He repeatedly emphasised these “operational realities” of running
a vaccine trial. “Every trial design, especially phase III, is always a
balancing act between different needs,” he said. “If you wanted to
have an answer on an endpoint that happens at a frequency of one
10th or one fifth the frequency of the primary endpoint, you would
need a trial that is either 5 or 10 times larger or you’d need a trial
that is 5 or 10 times longer to collect those events. Neither of these,
I think, are acceptable in the current public need for knowing
expeditiously that a vaccine works.”

Zaks added, “A 30 000 [participant] trial is already a fairly large
trial. If you’re asking for a 300 000 trial then you need to talk to the
people who are paying for it, because now you’re talking about not
a $500m to $1bn trial, you’re talking about something 10 times the
size. And I think the public purse and operational capabilities and
capacities we have are rightly spent not betting the farm on one
vaccinebut,asOperationWarpSpeed[theUSgovernment’scovid-19
vaccine plan] is trying to do, making sure that we’re funding several
vaccines in parallel.”


Medscape’s Eric Topol has been a vocal critic of the trials’ many interim
analyses. “These numbers seem totally out of line with what would be
considered stopping rules,” he says. “I mean, you’re talking about giving
a vaccine with any of these programmes to tens of millions of people.
And you’re going to base that on 100 events?”[8]

Great uncertainty remains over how long a randomised trial of a vaccine
will be allowed to proceed. If efficacy is declared, one possibility is that
the thousands of volunteers who received a saline placebo would be
offered the active vaccine, in effect ending the period of randomised
follow-up. Such a move would have far reaching implications for our
understanding of vaccines’ benefits and harms, rendering uncertain our
knowledge of whether the vaccines can reduce the risk of serious covid-19
disease and precluding any further ability to compare adverse events in
the experimental versus the placebo arm.
“It’ll be a decision we’ll have to take at that time. We have not committed
one way or another,” Moderna’s Tal Zaks told The BMJ. “It will be a
decision where FDA and NIH will also weigh in. And it will be probably a
very difficult decision, because you will be weighing the benefit to the
public in continuing to understand the longer term safety by keeping
people on placebo and the expectation of the people who have received
placebo to be crossed over now that it has been proved effective.”


#### Debating endpoints

Still, it’s fair to say that most of the general public assumes that the
whole point of the current trials, besides testing safety (box 1), is to
see whether the vaccine can prevent bad outcomes. “How do you
reconcile that?” The BMJ asked Zaks.


“Very simply,” he replied. “Number one, we have a bad outcome
as our endpoint. It’s covid-19 disease.” Moderna, like Pfizer and
Janssen, has designed its study to detect a relative risk reduction
of at least 30% in participants developing laboratory confirmed
covid-19, consistent with FDA and international guidance.[21 22]

Number two, Zaks pointed to influenza vaccines, saying they protect
against severe disease better than mild disease. To Moderna, it’s
the same for covid-19: if its vaccine is shown to reduce symptomatic
covid-19, it will be confident it also protects against serious
outcomes.

But the truth is that the science remains far from clear cut, even for
influenza vaccines that have been used for decades. Although
randomised trials have shown an effect in reducing the risk of
symptomatic influenza, such trials have never been conducted in
elderly people living in the community to see whether they save
lives.

Only two placebo controlled trials in this population have ever been
conducted, and neither was designed to detect any difference in
hospital admissions or deaths.[23] Moreover, dramatic increases in
use of influenza vaccines has not been associated with a decline in
mortality (box 2).[26]


**Box 2: Not enrolling enough elderly people or minorities**

A vaccine that has been proved to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease
by a certain proportion should, you might think, reduce serious outcomes
such as hospital admissions and deaths in equal proportion.
Peter Marks, an FDA official with responsibility over vaccine approvals,
recently stated as much about influenza vaccination, which “only prevents
flu in about half the people who get it. And yet that’s very important
because that means that it leads to half as many deaths related to
influenza each year.”[24]

But when vaccines are not equally effective in all populations the theory
breaks down.
If frail elderly people, who are understood to die in disproportionate
numbers from both influenza[25] and covid-19, are not enrolled into vaccine
trials in sufficient numbers to determine whether case numbers are
reduced in this group, there can be little basis for assuming any benefit
in terms of hospital admissions or mortality. Whatever reduction in cases
is seen in the overall study population (most of which may be among
healthy adults), this benefit may not apply to the frail elderly
subpopulation, and few lives may be saved.


**Box 1: Safety and side effects**

History shows many examples of serious adverse events from vaccines
brought to market in periods of enormous pressure and expectation.
There were contaminated polio vaccines in 1955, cases of Guillain-Barré
syndrome in recipients of flu vaccines in 1976, and narcolepsy linked to
one brand of influenza vaccine in 2009.[18 19]

“Finding severe rare adverse events will require the study of tens of
thousands of patients, but this requirement will not be met by early
adoption of a product that has not completed its full trial evaluation,”
Harvard drug policy researchers Jerry Avorn and Aaron Kesselheim recently
wrote in JAMA.[20]


Covid-19 vaccine trials are currently designed to tabulate final efficacy
results once 150 to 160 trial participants develop symptomatic
covid-19—and most trials have specified at least one interim analysis
allowing for the trials to end with even fewer data accrued.


-----

This is hard to evaluate in the current trials because there are large gaps
in the types of people being enrolled in the phase III trials (table 1).
Despite recruiting tens of thousands, only two trials are enrolling children
less than 18 years old. All exclude immunocompromised people and
pregnant or breastfeeding women, and though the trials are enrolling
elderly people, few or perhaps none of the studies would seem to be
designed to conclusively answer whether there is a benefit in this
population, despite their obvious vulnerability to covid-19.
“Adults over 65 will be an important subgroup that we will be looking
at,” Moderna’s Zaks told The BMJ. “That said . . . any given study is
powered for its primary endpoint—in our case covid-19 disease
irrespective of age.”
Al Sommer, dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
told The BMJ, “If they have not powered for evidence of benefit in the
elderly, I would find that a significant, unfortunate shortcoming.” He
emphasised the need for “innovative follow-up studies that will enable
us to better determine the direct level of protection immunisation has
on the young and, separately, the elderly, in addition to those at the
highest risk of severe disease and hospitalisation.”
One view is that trial data should be there for all target populations. “If
we don’t have adequate data in the greater than 65 year old group, then
the greater than 65 year old person shouldn’t get this vaccine, which
would be a shame because they’re the ones who are most likely to die
from this infection,” said vaccinologist Paul Offit.[8] “We have to generate
those data,” he said. “I can’t see how anybody—the Data and Safety
Monitoring Board or the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, or FDA
decision-makers—would ever allow a vaccine to be recommended for
that group without having adequate data.”
“I feel the same way about minorities,” Offit added. “You can’t convince
minority populations to get this vaccine unless they are represented in
these trials. Otherwise, they’re going to feel like they’re guinea pigs, and
understandably so.”
