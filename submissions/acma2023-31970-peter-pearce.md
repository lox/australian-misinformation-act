Submission Regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

To the Committee Overseeing the Inquiry,

I am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. The urgency and significance of the issue at
hand compelled me to voice these concerns, which are based on a letter I recently received detailing the
bill's propositions and potential repercussions.

Potential Erosion of Freedom of Speech: George Orwell, in his dystopian novel "1984", warned us about
a society where information is controlled by the state, leading to a fearful existence under constant
surveillance. The proposed bill, with its vaguely defined terms and broad powers handed to ACMA, eerily
resonates with such a chilling narrative. The right to freedom of speech is a cornerstone of any
democratic society. This bill, despite its good intentions, can inadvertently trample upon this right.

The Power and Scope of ACMA: Granting the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)
sweeping powers to police online "misinformation and disinformation" is deeply concerning. By placing
the responsibility on social media platforms and search engines to self-police or face exorbitant fines, the
government effectively nudges them to over-censor, potentially stifling legitimate discourse.

Ambiguity in Defining 'Misinformation' and 'Disinformation': While there's a distinction made between
misinformation and disinformation, the bill remains largely ambiguous on what qualifies as either. This
can lead to subjective interpretations and may inhibit discussions on topics that are deemed sensitive.

Exemptions Raise Doubts: The bill's decision to exclude mainstream media from its scope suggests an
inherent bias, insinuating that such entities are immune to spreading misinformation. This not only
undermines public trust but also inadvertently shields these institutions from accountability.

Potential for Overreach: With instant messaging services falling under the scope, and the possibility of
private messages eventually being surveilled, there's a potential for considerable overreach. Citizens
should not live in fear of discussing sensitive topics privately, lest they be flagged or penalized.

Misrepresentation of Constitutional Protection: The bill's 'guidance note' misleadingly gives the
impression that the Australian Constitution offers robust protections against potential infringements on

freedom of speech. As highlighted in the letter, Australia's interpretation of political expression is narrow,
leaving citizens without substantial protection.

In conclusion, while the goal of combating misinformation and disinformation is commendable, the
proposed bill, in its current form, seems to lean more towards controlling information rather than
genuinely addressing the problem. I implore the committee to consider the far-reaching implications of
this bill and work towards a solution that truly upholds the values of a democratic society.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Peter Pearce
