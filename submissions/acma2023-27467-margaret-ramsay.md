To Our Members of Parliament,

I am adamantly opposed to any legislation that will restrict access to information on all
topics that are in the public or private interests of the Australian people. The

proposed misinformation bill is completely  against our democracy. It is communism to the
extreme under the illusion that it is about removing misinformation.

One of the most important aspects of a democracy is the ability to have engage in healthy
informed discussions on all topics. We as the people of Australia, need to feel confident that
all information is being  made available to us in a form that is not being made difficult. I
understand that we are not in a court of law, but we should still be able to adequately
engage in discussions knowing we have all the information available.

If as a country, our people no longer feel we have access to information on topics that affect
us or others, then our confidence in the decisions that are being made in parliament
dwindles greatly. We are a well educated population, that can make decisions for ourselves if
we are not restricted in having access to all the information. This includes our media, of any
form, being able to, and being made to give us all of the information and not just what suits
special interest groups. Deliberate twisting of, deleting of, eliminating of and opinions given
by others should not be omitted.

To be able to freely discuss, debate and analyse a subject, is very important in a democracy.
So that the information can be analyse, dissected and formulated into a much clearer
understanding of a topic.

Yours sincerely

Margaret Ramsay
