To whom it may concern,

I am writing in regards to the Bill that will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital
platforms to do more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation
and disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech.

Although I believe that misinformation and disinformation does pose a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy. I am very
concerned with who decides what is misinformation and disinformation and whether there is an
agenda behind hiding information under this Bill to suit a government or corporate control of the
population.

Further regulations will monitor and prevent independent journalists from sharing The Truth
about what is and what has been going on all around the globe. They have bought the truth to
light about what has been going on over the last few years with regards to the ‘Plandemic’
Almost anything I shared on social media was blocked or deemed misinformation, dangerous
content and often banned from social media. Independent journalists sharing facts found on
government websites, statistics that were published by The World Health Organization, all
banned from social media. This is not protecting the Australian public, this is a form of control
that will enforce a regime of suppression of any speech on social media that undermines
government claims.

There are global concerns regarding CBDC, food scarcity, energy and how to combat these

issues. Many of the decisions are being made by unelected people and these Bills are slowly

being pushed through without public knowledge. The only reason I am aware is because of

dedicated journalists on social media platforms and people sharing their own experiences in

other parts of the world. Unfortunately, main stream media platforms are owned by

corporations who are ‘In Bed’ with the government, if this Bill is passed it will take away our

democratic society, and our personal right to freedom of speech. Taking away our freedom of

speech and allowing others to investigate and share ideology against what the government

wants us to hear and belief will only create a fearful society who conforms to dictatorship.

Kind regards,
