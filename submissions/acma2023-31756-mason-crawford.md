Over 70 years ago, George Orwell wrote a book, a fictional book considered as

political satire. Well, it seems Mr. Orwell had prophetical powers of some sort or other, as
here today in Australia, a country that fought bravely against the tyranny and lies of Hitler’s
despotic regime, now wants to take a page out of Goebbels’ book and create its own version
of a propaganda machine/ministry of truth. No good can come from giving an unelected
government bureaucracy the power to decide what is true and what is false in social media,
main stream media, newspapers, books, TV, classrooms, movies or any platform with which
people discuss any topic what so ever!

Robust debate and the open exchange of ideas is required for countries, governments,

and even humanity as a whole, to become better. This legislation would stifle that, and the
fact that someone in government would even put this proposal forth, scares me!
