I am deeply concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’.
It is very subjective and open to abuse. Freedom of speech is a fundamental pillar of our democracy, and the proposed bill
would erode this right. .

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal.
