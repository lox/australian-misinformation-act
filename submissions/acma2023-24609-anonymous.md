After reading the Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023, I would like to express my
disapproval of the mentioned bill as it will infringe on the principles of democracy as well as the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

In particular, article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, "Everyone has the right
to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

Democracy is based on the fundamental value of freedom of assembly, association, property rights,
freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from
unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.

I believe that any human being is capable of making their own conclusions on public matters after study
and research, and for this reason we should rather encourage personal and public debate as it is this
very aspect of our society that has allowed us so far to improve our human conditions, and has allowed
the progress and evolution of our society and knowledge on all topics, including but not limited to
science, medicine, law, politics, and education.

What is going to be of our evolution as human species and society without the freedom to speak, and
so, to think independently?

I, therefore, would like to request all members of parliament to vote "NO" to the Combat
Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023.
