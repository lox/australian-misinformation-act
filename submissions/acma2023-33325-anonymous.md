# 'Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation' 2023

I strongly oppose this bill 'Combatting Misinformation & Disinformation' 2023. I oppose any form of
censorship, oppose any law which would empower ACMA or any other Australian body to restrict in
any way our right to communicate freely and openly on any issue whatsoever.

Australia already has sufficient laws to protect people from alleged hate speech or threats.

ACMA or any other body should not be the arbiter of what is mis-information. A Government or
Government agency which is a centralised authority who determines what is true or false becomes a
dictatorship. The Government will be the sole source of truth.

Conspiracy theories exist and individuals are responsible to search for the truth and make
appropriate decisions for themselves which is the foundation of a just and democratic society. It is
well known that some conspiracy theories have been the truth given time.

Who can determine what is Misinformation & Disinformation? You canâ€™t put a committee of people
in power to determine this. People have bias and can be bought to silence Australian people.

ACMA or any other body should not be the decider/arbiter of what is Misinformation &
Disinformation. The solution to scientific or political controversies, or other matters, is more debate
not censorship. The best solution is free and open debate and not stifling freedom of speech and
expression.

I do not trust that ACMA or other bodies will not pressure digital platform services to require specific
content or posts to be removed as the threat of penalties will be enough for digital media to overcensor submitted content. This has occurred in the past few years with the USA and other countries.
