The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 appears to be a continuation of the appalling and draconian playbook that
was unleashed during Covid-19. It is so far removed from the more democratic processes
Australians were accustomed to pre-Covid, and much more aligned with the totalitarian measures of
Hitler, Stalin and Mao. It seems clear that the arbiters of misinformation and disinformation will be
the government, via ACMA, armed by a media that will censor and control free speech, which they
are still doing with Covid. This proposed legislation is extremely dangerous and I will not be voting
for any party that supports it.
