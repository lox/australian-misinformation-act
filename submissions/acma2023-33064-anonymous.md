Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

##### (the Communications Legislation Amendment [Combatting

 Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

I write to express my concerns in relation to the above-named bill.

## Threat to our Democracy

Along with many people in Australia, I absolutely oppose any laws which

would empower ACMA or any other Australian body to restrict in any way our

right to communicate freely and openly on any issue whatsoever.

Liberal democracies such as Australia rest on the principle that people have

the right to hold and to freely express any beliefs that they choose. Free

speech is an all-or-nothing concept; there are no gradations where it can be

slightly limited. When governments start determining what can or cannot be

expressed society loses its openness and freedom.

I believe that it is each person's individual choice to read, listen to or watch

##### whatever they please without government interference. As consenting adults

we are blessed with the ability to think critically. It is not the role of

##### government or a government agency to proscribe what information we may,

or may not, be exposed to. The same goes for any opinions that we may wish

to express (obviously, things like incitement to violence and similar crimes

should not be allowed         - however legislation already exists to deal with these

instances).

The most effective way to combat misinformation or disinformation is through

public debate, where ideas are openly discussed and the public decides what

##### they believe to be true. In the digital age, the internet and its platforms have

become the modern town square, a space that must remain unaffected by

##### government influence.

If the government starts dictating what can or cannot be discussed online,

both publicly and privately, our democratic society would transform into an


-----

authoritarian regime. We must tread cautiously and not allow any governing

body, regardless of its intentions, to decide what topics are acceptable for

discussion. This principle holds true for any genuine democracy.

## Lack of Proper Definition of Key Terms

The key terms in the draft legislation are "misinformation", "disinformation"

and "serious harm", and all three of these terms are so poorly defined as to be

not only functionally meaningless, but open to serious abuse.

"Misinformation" is defined as "information that is false, misleading or

deceptive. "Disinformation" has the same definition as misinformation, but

with the added condition that "the person disseminating, or causing the

dissemination of, the content intends that the content deceive another

person". How would the oversight person calculate the “intention” of the

person disseminating content? How will ACMA determine if the person

disseminating “intends” to deceive? How will anyone be capable of discerning

the intent behind any individual's decision to share a piece of content online?

"Harm" is the most problematic of the key terms. Instead of defining "harm"

itself, the draft bill gives six instances of "harms", four of which constitute

##### circular definitions - that is, they use the word "harm" to define the word

"harm".

The lack of proper definitions of key terms, and lack of transparency with

respect to the process of classifying mis- and disinformation, leaves open the

possibility          - indeed the probability          - that the legislation will be weaponised

against individuals or groups who hold positions contrary to government

policy. The draft Bill provides no mechanism by which such weaponisation

could be prevented.

## The Bill contravenes a key human rights treaty

Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),

to which Australia is a signatory, enshrines the following rights: "the right to

hold opinions without interference" and "the right to freedom of expression;


-----

this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and

ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in

the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".

The draft Bill directly contravenes the second of these rights, by seeking to

impose restrictions on the types of information that individuals can seek,

receive and share, based on poorly-defined categories of potential or putative

"harm". The attack on the first right is indirect; by policing the information

available to Australians, government appears to be covertly seeking to

influence, and even control, the opinions we hold.

In summary, this Bill represents an assault on the pillars of our democracy:

the right of citizens to hold and express opinions, and to seek information from

a wide diversity of sources. This draft Bill signals a dangerous turn toward

totalitarianism. It is akin to the creation of a “Ministry of Truth” as per George

##### Orwell’s “1984”. Australians do not need government to protect us from

information; we need government to protect our human rights.

Yours Sincerely
