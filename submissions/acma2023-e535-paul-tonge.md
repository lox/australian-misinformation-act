Please refrain from assuming that ever person in the population is of low intelligence. When Governments step in to control the
flow of information the right to decide truth is removed for many. After many lies have been pedalled by governments here and
world-wide, why should Australians give up their right to decide on where the truth is? This bill whether well intended or not will
give control to successive governments, not just the current government. This is a frightening proposition for many Australians.
The ego and ideology of a few will trump the will of the people. This bill is a slide towards the type of politics that many
immigrants to Australia escaped over the last century. Please do not be a participant in a law that we don't need and don't want.
Free speech is being eroded and will not be viewed kindly by history.
