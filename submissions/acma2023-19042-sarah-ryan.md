To whom it may concern,

Thank you for inviting the public to provide feedback on the exposure draft of the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023.

The introduction of this Bill is very concerning as such legislation often walks a fine line
between protecting against harmful content and safeguarding freedom of speech.

Below I have listed some common concerns that can arise:

1. Definitions and Scope: One challenge is defining the scope of what constitutes

misinformation and disinformation. Determining what content qualifies as false,
misleading, or harmful can be subjective and may lead to potential biases or unintended
consequences. It is crucial to ensure that any legislation has clear definitions and does not
impede legitimate speech or dissenting opinions.

2. Freedom of Speech: Any measures aimed at combating misinformation and

disinformation should be carefully balanced with the principle of freedom of speech.
There is a risk that well-intentioned legislation could inadvertently restrict legitimate
expression, hinder public debate, or create a chilling effect on free expression.

3. Content Regulation: The question of who determines what is misinformation and

disinformation is important. If regulatory bodies or platforms have the power to remove
or suppress content, it raises concerns about censorship, the concentration of power, and
potential biases. Transparency, accountability, and due process should be integral parts of
any content regulation framework.

4. Effectiveness: Addressing misinformation and disinformation requires a comprehensive

approach that goes beyond legislation alone. It is essential to consider whether the
proposed measures will effectively achieve their intended goals. Balancing the need to
combat harmful content with promoting media literacy, critical thinking skills, and a
diverse media ecosystem is crucial.

5. International Standards: In an interconnected world, it is important to consider the global

implications of any legislation. Efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation
should align with international human rights standards and not unduly restrict the free
flow of information or burden online platforms disproportionately.

Furthermore, information that is classed as “disinformation” or “misinformation” today, may in
future be proven to be fact. Such as how we now know that lockdowns do more harm than good,
or how pharmaceutical products, namely the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, are linked to
myocarditis with little effect in reducing transmission. Therefore, it is critical to understand how
“misinformation” or “disinformation” that is later proven to be fact will be managed and whether
people or organisations who shared this information, and were punished for the sharing of this
information, will be managed and compensated?

Moreover, the introduction of this legislation provides the government with the power to
effectively discard freedom of speech within our society. Freedom of speech is widely
considered to be an integral pillar of democracy due to its crucial role in promoting open
dialogue, fostering a diversity of ideas, and enabling citizens to participate fully in the
democratic process. Should this legislation be introduced, would Australia remain to be
considered as a democratic society? Or would our once great country evolve into a communist
regime whereby our leaders censor information and disallow freedom of speech?

Below I have listed some key reasons why freedom of speech is essential to democracy.

1. Expression of Ideas: Freedom of speech allows individuals to express their opinions,

thoughts, and ideas without fear of censorship or punishment. It ensures that diverse
perspectives and voices can be heard, contributing to a rich marketplace of ideas. By
allowing open and robust debate, democracy benefits from the collective wisdom and
knowledge of its citizens.

2. Accountability and Transparency: Freedom of speech acts as a powerful tool for holding

governments, public officials, and institutions accountable. Citizens can freely criticize
those in power, question their decisions, and expose any wrongdoing or corruption. It
promotes transparency and helps prevent abuses of authority, thereby strengthening
democratic governance.

3. Public Discourse and Participation: A democratic society thrives on informed and

engaged citizens. Freedom of speech encourages active participation by enabling
individuals to discuss, debate, and deliberate on matters of public importance. It
facilitates the exchange of information and opinions, leading to a better-informed
electorate capable of making well-considered decisions.

4. Progress and Innovation: Freedom of speech fosters an environment that encourages

innovation, creativity, and progress. It allows individuals to share new ideas, challenge
existing norms, and propose alternative solutions to societal issues. By protecting
freedom of expression, democracy creates a space for intellectual and social
advancement.

5. Peaceful Resolution of Conflicts: In societies where freedom of speech is protected,
people have a means to express their grievances and dissent peacefully. It provides an
outlet for frustrations and reduces the likelihood of dissent turning into violence or unrest.
By enabling dialogue and negotiation, freedom of speech contributes to the peaceful
resolution of conflicts within a democratic framework.

6. Protection of Individual Rights: Freedom of speech is closely linked to other fundamental
rights and liberties. It acts as a safeguard for individual autonomy, allowing people to live
according to their own beliefs and values. By protecting freedom of expression,
democracy protects the rights of minorities, dissidents, and marginalized groups who may
face discrimination or persecution.

7. Checks and Balances: Freedom of speech plays a vital role in maintaining checks and
balances in democratic systems. It allows the media, civil society organizations, and
citizens to act as watchdogs, scrutinizing the actions of those in power. By enabling the
dissemination of information and diverse viewpoints, it helps prevent the concentration of
power and encourages democratic accountability.

Finally, as a member of the Australian public, I believe that the government has overstepped its
bounds by attempting to censor the people with the proposed passage of this legislation.
Government censorship is typically viewed as harmful for several reasons, including the fact that
it frequently violates fundamental human rights and contradicts the values of democracy and free
expression. Australian citizens ought to have the freedom to express themselves and live in an
uncensored society. In a previous instance of government censorship,

In my view, this represented an utter scandal yet there was little to no interest from the
mainstream media. People are increasingly turning away from mainstream media for their news
and information, which could be attributed to mainstream media’s lack of reporting on crucial
matters such as revelations. It seems the Labor government is displeased
and attempting to implement legislation to formally legalise their censorship activities.

In conclusion, I completely disagree with the introduction of any legislation that censors
information available to the Australian people and impedes on their freedom of speech.

Sincerely,
