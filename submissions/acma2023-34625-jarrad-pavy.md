Freedom of speech, or freedom of expression is the most fundamental right in a Western democracy
like Australia. The right to voice your opinion freely without fear of censorship or retaliation
shouldn’t be controversial.

Yet the Albanese government seems hell bent on passing laws declaring war on ‘disinformation’ or
‘misinformation’ and seeking to impose a new regime of censorship on anyone with whom they
disagree or dares to post material deemed unacceptable by the government. Most telling all of is the
fact that government’s own draft bill specifically excludes the government and the mainstream
media from their own rules regarding misinformation!

This bill should be rejected, and this government deserves to be severely punished at the next
election from trying to undermine the basic civil liberties of the populace.
