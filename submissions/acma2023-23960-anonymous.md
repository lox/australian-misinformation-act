# Censorship is one sided.

My opinion of the ACMA getting involved in every Australian life in the way of freedom of
expressing, unhindered, their own opinions is out of line in a free country.

The only countries that would ever want to do this are the ones that are trying to take more control
over its population because they fear losing control or want to change how the population thinks of
things.

Censorship is not the business the ACMA, or any other organization. People can figure out all that is
out there on their own time.

One conversation is covered up – while another conversation is deemed fine to public to see and
hear. There are ALWAYS experts on both sides to issues – beliefs – practices… Censorship is one
sided.

Please stop this nonsense of promoting control freaks in Australia.

Keep Australia free!

Most sincerely,
