Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformafion and disinformafion (the Communicafions
Legislafion Amendment (Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion) Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

SUBMISSION

It is my opinion that this bill should not be passed. As an Australian cifizen I do not need
ACMA to ‘protect’ me, I am quite capable of choosing what informafion I read or watch and
crifically analyse ideas for myself. I enjoy exposure to a varied interpretafion of informafion,
which at fimes can allow me to consider ideas that I might not have thought of. If I do not
want to engage in content, I can simply turn it off. As a teacher I am aware of how sharing
different interpretafions can enrich understanding.

Reading through this bill I find it inconsistent with basic human rights of freedom of speech
and expression. Freedoms that should be fundamental rights in a democracy where people
have the right of self-determinafion.

This Bill is highly ambiguous in terms of ‘misinformafion codes’ and who is going to develop
them, who will replace or vary the code used. In my opinion this Bill allows ACMA too much
power in deciding what is misinformafion, without any meaningful checks and balances in
place. The penalfies are heavy handed and a violafion of freedom of though and freedom of
expression. This Bill has the potenfial to turn law abiding Australian cifizens into criminals for
expressing their democrafic rights to free speech and expression.

The words “The Parliament intends the services be regulated”, are not adequate protecfion
for the Australian people considering what we have witnessed over the past three years.
Government representafives daily encouraged the dangerous Covid 19 shots, which have
now been proven neither safe nor effecfive. And an unparalleled waste of taxpayers’ dollars.

To ‘protect’ the Australian people this Bill would be befter served as a check and balance for
the ‘informafion’ coming from the parliament and its propaganda apparatus to the people.
This Bill needs to be used for those that are on the exclusion list, except for (a). It might help
the Parliament remember that they are supposed to represent and work for the good of the
people of Australia, not their detriment.
