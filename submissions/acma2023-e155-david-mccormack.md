**New ACMA powers to combat misinformafion and disinformafion**

The bill that is proposed is extremely dangerous and represents a massive overreach of the
government. The simple fact that a nonelected government organisafion will decide what is dis/mis
informafion and will have the powers to censor/limit/label content places power beyond the scope
of government agencies and damages fundamental rights of democracy in this country.

It is nonsensical to believe the Australian public could trust a government organisafion with the
power to influence the public narrafive on any topic it chooses. This power will erode the foundafion
of democracy at the deepest level.

Who decides what should be labelled mis/disinformafion? The public needs the opportunity to
decide their point of view based on ALL the informafion, that is how democracy works, indeed that is
how science works. Open debate on topics receiving the same for and against arguments. The
inference that mis/disinformafion is dangerous pales into insignificance the potenfial harm contrived
meddling of the facts will provide to democrafic choice.

At what point does the government instruct the ACMA on pushing its agenda? During a pandemic?
During an energy crisis? During a climate emergency? Any perceived crisis will represent an
opportunity for government via the ACMA to enforce its opinions and manipulate the public.

There is no balance possible where this concept of censoring informafion will lead to a more
balanced outcome for the public to make decisions based on all the available informafion. In the
media currently there is extreme polarisafion and distrust of media outlets driven mostly by the
underlying narrafive of each media/news organisafion outlet. The only way to bring this together and
for the public to again trust its sources of informafion is to have less censorship and greater
transparency. This bill will only deepen the mistrust within the community, increase the divide
between community groups and lead to a more fractured society distrusfful of everyone.

Well done government on making things worse.
