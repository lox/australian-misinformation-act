To whom it may concern,

I would like to know why the government thinks it can setup a regulatory authority like this
ACMA to dictate what information everyday Australians share with the public.
I consider the very notion of monitoring people's expressed views and information to be an
invasion on our right to free speech. Just because they say they will 'balance freedom of
speech', this in itself is a subjective notion and is open to interpretation. If the information is
against what the government narrative is pushing, then certainly this is a conflict of interest.
This regulatory authority is appointed by the government as the instrument to discern what is
misinformation/disinformation and therefore their perception will most likely be bias.

These new proposed powers are an invasion of a democratic right to free speech.
I absolutely object to this bill and I do not consent for any regulatory authority to keep my
personal details or comments in some sort of data base to establish whether I should be
punished or not. This is merely legislative course to initiate a social credit score for Australia
as the CCP has already done so in China. Anyone not deemed by the government to not be
behaving has their score reduced and is therefore punished by basic freedoms like the right to
move freely and unhindered, stripped away.
This will coincide with the Digital IDs that are planned to come into effect. And these 15min
neighbourhoods which clearly restrict movement. This is a totalitarian dictatorship delivered
to us by the foreign power of the World Economic Forum.
More and more Australians are aware of the agendas surrounding population control, and
they will no longer stand for it.
Expect push back from many people who value freedom and truth.
