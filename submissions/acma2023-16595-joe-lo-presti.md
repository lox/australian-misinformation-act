NEW ACMA POWERS

Since the rise of the digital world, I have had the opportunity to access information beyond what I could get
from newspapers, TV or radio. I use my life experiences or my doctor, lawyer, accountant, family or friends
to get a second opinion on any information that warrants it.

I do not want any government in this country or elsewhere to impinge on freedom of speech.

In part through access to digital information I become more aware of how much misinformation and
disinformation that governments themselves peddle.

I want to feel free to criticise and use the power of the digital world to push back. Defamation laws and
criminal laws are sufficient to keep commentary in check.

I do not want to see another layer of government hovering over all information. Use a scalpel and the
criminal law to weed out information harmful to children and leave the adults to make up their own
minds as to what information they wish to believe.
