If this Bill is passed it would give the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) the power to control free speech in Australia, making Australiaâ€™s
commitment to freedom of speech meaningless.

Australia has put laws in place and is a party to the seven core international human
rights treaties. It therefore has an obligation to uphold our basic human rights. This
includes freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to self governance.
Australia is a signatory to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights (ISESCR), which cover these basic human rights. These rights have been
recognised by all human societies for thousands of years. We live in a western
democratic society, therefore these rights should not be compromised.

In addition, under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 all new Bills
must be accompanied by a Statement of Compatibility, which assesses the
compatibility of the proposed legislation with the rights and freedoms recognised in
the seven core international human rights treaties that Australia has ratified,
including the ICCPR.

Lastly, the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) created the
Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) and their main function is to ensure
our human rights are upheld. This Bill would allow ACMA to bypass all these Acts,
laws and ratified treaties and strip people of their rights.
