Australia is signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Article 19 of the Declaration reads:

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to_
**_hold opinions without interference and to seek,_** **_receive and impart information and ideas_**
**_through any media and regardless of frontiers._**

The “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023” is in clear conflict with the Declaration. It would be complete
hypocrisy if the Bill were to be enacted while Australia remains a signatory to the
Declaration. (It would be just as bad for Australia to walk away from the Declaration.)

Moreover, the Bill is vague and subjective on the most crucial points.

“Harm” is defined as:

“(a) hatred”- that could be taken by someone who wants to take offence as including
anything;

“(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia” – again, that is so broad and ill-defined
as to be effectively meaningless;

“(d) harm to the health of Australians” – presumably that is meant to capture anything that
goes against the official narrative on covid 19. (Recall how we were initially told that if you
had the vaccine you would be protected from getting covid? Mis/disinformation?)

“(e) harm to the Australian environment” – presumably that is meant to silence any
questioning of the official narrative of climate change even though there are many justifiable
reasons for doing so.

The Government of the day is setting itself up, via ACMA, as the fountain of all truth.
Anyone with even a minimal knowledge of history should know how foolish and dangerous it
would be to give any government such power.

It is said that ACMA won’t directly regulate individual pieces of content. This is completely
disingenuous. ACMA, by way of the threat of heavy fines of media platforms and individuals
if they don’t pull down anything that ACMA may be deem “harmful”, can try and wash their
hands of the actual dirty work. But who would they be fooling?

If this Bill were to become law it would have a disastrously chilling effect on free expression
and the exchange of ideas. It is hard not to believe that this is the specific intention of the
Bill.

It is true that some people have and will abuse free speech, but the suppression of free speech
will be far more harmful to our society. As George Orwell said, “If liberty means anything at
all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”

We do not need or want a nanny State.

This Bill should be abandoned.
