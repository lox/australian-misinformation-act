Thankyou for the opportunity to express my views on the exposure draft Bill.

I do not support the Government’s proposed legislation. It is a dramatic escalation of control
over on-line communication, purportedly for a good cause (to protect individuals and society)
but potentially to our detriment. It leaves the door wide open to government censorship of the
sharing of ideas and shutting down of public debate. It is inappropriate over-reach by
government which is contrary to Australia’s status as a free nation. The right to freedom of
opinion and expression (Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 19) is foundational
and essential in a free society.

The impetus for this bill is the June 2021 report from ACMA, the government’s industry
regulator, which recommended that the government increase its (ACMAs) powers. The report
was informed by research of a subjective nature at a time when the covid-19 pandemic was
rife. The conclusion that online misinformation is harmful has been extrapolated from this
and the recommendation to increase their own power is unashamedly a conflict of interest.

Inaccurate and biased information is ever present in the media. Fortunately, Australians have
the opportunity to hear from a variety of sources and have the freedom to ask questions.
Government control over what can be shared via online media is what happens in China; it
does not belong in Australia. Furthermore, to suggest that government publications and
official news services be exempt from regulation only confirms a totalitarian approach.

On-line misinformation has the potential to be problematic; consequently, we need to learn to
be discerning and not assume that everything presented to us is accurate. ACMA’s website
lists tips for identifying misinformation and it would be of greater benefit to individuals and
society if these were widely promoted rather than ACMA wielding heavy handed control
over the digital industry to remove misinformation.

Misinformation and disinformation are easy terms to define but not easy to apply. The Bill
defines misinformation as content that is false, misleading or deceptive and where the
provision of that content on the service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious
harm. Who decides what is false? What one believes to be false will be considered true by
another. Who decides what ‘reasonably likely’ means? An assessment considered sensible by
one will be considered ill-advised by another. The interpretation of ‘serious harm’ is
potentially broad. The examples given in the fact sheet are situations where misinformation
results in existing laws being broken or warnings ignored; these are already dealt with under
the Online Safety Act 2021 or the offence of Incitement. ‘Serious harm’ might also be used to
describe the feelings that result from a perceived insult, which may in fact simply be a
difference of opinion.

Misinformation is a term often used by Prime Minister Albanese when confronted by an
alternate view as a means to shutting down respectful, intelligent debate. It is a method akin
to bullying. It declares the other view to be false without question and to not be worth
considering. The proposed bill would enable the government to shut down public debate by
eliminating alternate views from online media. Tellingly, just this week PM Albanese joked
in a radio interview that he would ban social media if he could.

The answer to misinformation is more information, not removal of the misinformation, lest it
be found to be true after all.
