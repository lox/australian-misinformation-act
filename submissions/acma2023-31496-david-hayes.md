This proposed bill to give ACMA new powers to combat misinformation and disinformation
should be tossed in the bin.

“Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians,
as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”

This sounds like something from Orwell’s Ministry of Truth. We don’t need some
bureaucrats to tell us what is misinformation and disinformation nor to censor from public
view information they deem harmful to our safety and wellbeing or that of our democracy,
society and economy. If points of view that differ from the authorised are banned then our
democracy and society has reached a dystopian 1984 level. I don’t want the government
deciding for me what to read, listen to, see or think. The best way to combat
misinformation or disinformation is to present alternative views and let the people decide.
That, after all, is what a robust democracy demands.

Attacks such as the one that this bill proposes on free speech are becoming all too plain to
see for anyone who has witnessed the way our society has deteriorated from 9/11 on. After
the events of 9/11 and the launch of the war on terror many of our previous freedoms
were curtailed in the name of fighting terrorism. These days we don’t hear about many
terrorist attacks but AML, KYC rules and Xray scans at airports are still in force.

We have just lived thru several years of Covid19 mask and distancing mandates,
lockdowns and vaccine mandates. All these were “authorised” by politicians and
bureaucrats for the safety and wellbeing of Australians. These same authorities claimed
the vaccines were safe and effective and anyone who dared state a different point of view
was to be censored and branded “antivax”. Well it seems that a lot of scientific studies
have shown that they were neither safe nor effective. So you see why one might be
sceptical about future claims by “authorised” gatekeepers to be arbiters of misinformation
and disinformation.

And on the horizon we see approaching other crises about which the “authorised” powers
may wish to curb potential misinformation and disinformation. Since about 2018 there has
been a definite “authorised” narrative about China being an aggressive and potentially
threatening country to Australia. This (dis)information campaign comes from the US fears
of losing its hegemony in the world, and the US has orders of magnitude more influence
on Australian domestic and foreign policy than China. So much so that the “authorised”
view is that anyone who may want to condemn AUKUS or the surrender of Australian
sovereignty to US military and economic interests may well be accused of misinformation
and disinformation and thereby silenced.

Climate change is another “crisis” approaching. Already people who argue against the
“climate catastrophe”, even scientists, are called “climate deniers” and their views
classified as misinformation. Thru history society has developed and advanced by using
more and more energy. What Australia needs is a real debate about all the options
available to enable our country to progress and its people to flourish.

On all and any potential threats or challenges, the way forward is to make our society
more resilient and informed. That is served by making information, different opinions and
robust debate widely available. It is definitely not in allowing some information to be
classified by experts and bureaucrats as “authorised” and therefore publicly available, and
contrary views as misinformation or disinformation and withheld from public view.
