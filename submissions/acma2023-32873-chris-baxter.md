Submission to The Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combating
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023
By Chris Baxter, 19 August 2023
The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation)
Bill 2023 would impose a regime of pre-censorship, censorship, monitoring,
discriminatory
categorisation and reporting on the public speech of Australian citizens.
In providing feedback to this Bill I feel akin to a child who's being threatened
to be locked in their
room indefinitely, to keep them safe from the kids at the park.. then asked for
feedback. So
please forgive me for being to the point.
This Bill is authoritarian and Marxist in character and must be withdrawn.
From First Reading the Misinformation Bill Until Now
I was on holiday in late July when I first heard about a “Misinformation Bill”.
As a long time
advocate of Free Speech my initial reaction was one of both curiosity and
concern. Later that
evening, after the kids were put to bed, I grabbed my laptop to see if I could
find a copy of the
Bill online.
As I started to read the Bill I was astonished as clause after clause showed
ideologically Marxist
characteristics. I began to tweet a thread of my initial reactions, a thread
that has now (as of 19
August) received over 157,000 views and 888 retweets. It was clear to me that
the concerns I
raised were and are echoed by ordinary Australians.
I want to reproduce these tweets, prior to arguing the case less emotively, to
present to
legislators and politicians the absolute disgust Australians have towards this
authoritarian
overreach.

The Creation of an Advocacy Group Against the Bill

Over subsequent weeks, Australians from all walks of life reached out to me,
asking what I
thought we should do about this Bill. I encouraged them to make submissions. The
number of
people reaching out to me continued to grow and so I founded, alongside about 10
others, the
advocacy group https://www.stopaussiecensorship.org to raise public awareness of
the Bill. The
information we have provided and misinformation (provided in the Guidance Note
and by some
Media Outlets) that we have corrected, has led to many bespoke submissions being
made.


-----

The original due date for feedback was 4 August (a little over a month from when
the draft Bill
was released). The onus on regular Australians to learn this process, and write
their own
submission from scratch, within this time period, was of course very burdensome.
The extension
of the submission period to 20 August did not significantly lessen that burden.
Therefore, alongside encouraging people to write their own submissions, we
created a
Submission Assistant Tool to address this burden. The Tool has now assisted many
Australians
who did not have the confidence to, or otherwise, felt unable to write a
submission from scratch.
Using our tool, Australians have been able to choose the concerns that they want
to convey to
the Government about the Bill and be provided with a first draft.
We sincerely hope that submissions that have used AI will not be viewed as less
authentic than
those that do not. To believe that a submission that has been generated using
AI, in part or in
whole, is less authentic, without understanding the individual circumstances of
the submitter,
would of course be quite presumptuous and inequitable.
Why Am I Writing This Submission? A personal perspective
My way of brief introduction, I am a Christian, an IP attorney, advisor to the
Baxter Charitable
Trusts (two of the larger family charitable trusts in Australia), husband and
father to three.
If this Bill is implemented, it will significantly affect my day-to-day life. As
do many others, I like
to explore what is true and false behind matters on my Twitter/X profile.
If this Bill is implemented I would expect some of my posts to be pre-censored
by digital
platforms looking to reduce misinformation to avoid fines. Yet it is those posts
that might contain
debate of most usefulness to society.
These posts are an important aspect of my contribution, as a member and thinker,
to Australian
society. Removal of my posts would stop me from expressing my identity and
contributing to
society in this way.

Equally concerningly, censorship of posts will restrict my access to many

controversial or
“narrative-incorrect” posts which may be helpful as an aspect of my sense-making
process, to
properly understand the world around me.
Therefore, this Bill stands to fundamentally alter my quality of life as an
Australian citizen.
***
I will now move from personal reflections and experiences to briefly discuss the
principle of free
speech, why it matters and then provide 12 reasons why this Bill should be
withdrawn.
What is Free Speech and Why Does it Matter?


-----

Free speech is not a matter of whether someone can say what they think without
going to jail.
Rather, it is whether someone can say what they think in public without any
Government
coercion, intimidation, belittling, threats or censorship, whether carried out
directed or indirectly
via one or more intermediary bodies, organisations, codes or companies.
Free speech is extremely important. Western society has rarely existed without
it, so it is easy to
forget what an important role it plays in safeguarding society from
authoritarians and tyrants. A
quote from Scanlon, below, sums it up best.

I have many other concerns about this Bill. I will now address 12 concerns in

particular:
Concern 1 - This is a Bill of inequitable and politically
partisan assumptions
This Bill divides citizens into two classes:

1. Those whom the Govt. deems trustworthy to participate in public forums

without being
monitored and reported on, and
2. Those whom the Govt. deems cannot be trusted.
The former group, I will call the Viewpoint Elites, because they are those who
are not required to
have content they produce, known as Excluded Content, monitored. Their content
is excluded
from consideration under this Bill by s7(1)(b).
The latter group, consisting of ordinary citizens, I will call the Deplorables,
because the Govt. is
proposing that they are treated as not having any viewpoint worthy of
consideration.
The Viewpoint Elites
The Viewpoint Elites include, according to the definition of Excluded Content in
the Bill,
Government authorised journalists (“professional news content”), Government
authorised
educators (Govt. accredited “educational institution[s]”) and the Government
bodies themselves.
It doesn’t take much imagination to realise that the Govt. approved journalists
are effectively
being “bribed” for favourable news coverage and/or being incentivised for
continuing supportive
perspectives, such as for support for this Bill.
As this “MisSpeak” legislation comes into full swing, and misinformation and
disinformation
reports proliferate about their non-approved competitor journalists, such Govt.
authorised
journalists and their respective publications will stand to benefit financially
in the long-term. This
is because misinformation and disinformation reports stand to have a significant
negative effect
on the reputation of non-approved competitor publications.
Educators and Government bodies are primarily on the Government payroll, mostly
viewpoint
partisan (left-wing) in their operations and commonly accepted to be employers


-----

of people who
are left-leaning politically.
In other words, the Viewpoint Elites are:
1. Either being “bribed” by being offered non-interference and stand to gain
financially (in
the case of Govt. approved journalists) or existing Government beneficiaries (in
the case
of those on Government payroll); and
2. Are almost entirely politically aligned on the side of the Government.
Therefore, the data collected and reports made under s18 & 19 of the Bill will
be primarily
directed towards those whom the Govt. does not stand to benefit from (e.g. by
receiving
favorable news coverage), those who are not existing beneficiaries, or those who
are not on the
same side of politics as the Govt.
Accordingly, this Bill introduces a substantial moral, financial and political
division of citizens into
two classes. This is highly inequitable.

Has the Government found that the perspectives of the Viewpoint Elites are more

trustworthy or
more true than those of the Deplorables? If so, we would like to see the
evidence for this.
Key Points
A. Govt. is primarily rewarding its journalist supporters with non-interference
and a
commitment to interfere with others, some of whom are their non-Govt approved
competitors.
B. Existing public servant beneficiaries of Govt are suggesting legislation that
is for
the benefit of themselves because it supports their left-leaning political
allies.
C. Govt. has introduced a Bill that seeks to divide citizens into two classes
with one
class receiving greater financial and political benefits from the legislation
than the
other class.
Concern 2 - Intimidation at every level
Intimidation strategies are well known and typically have not been used by
Western
Governments against their own citizens.
However, this changed in 2020. During the Covid period, State and Federal
Governments
practiced various intimidation tactics against those who wanted to maintain
their freedom of
movement, freedom of political communication, freedom to work and freedom of
bodily
autonomy.
Large protests ensued and a significant portion of the Australian population is
still highly
resentful of how they were intimidated into taking risks to their personal
health, with what were
essentially experimental medicines, and how their freedoms were impinged upon.
One form of intimidation is dis-empowerment. Dis-empowerment occurs when rules


-----

are made
which pre-suppose fault by an individual, a group or an entire “class” of
citizen as is the case
with the Deplorables. The individual and group level psychological effects of
dis-empowerment
are well known.
But how does this Bill pre-suppose fault of the Deplorables? It achieves this by
making
numerous unsubstantiated presuppositions. Two of the most concerning are:
1. That the Deplorable class of citizen is incapable of engaging in a public
sense-making
process without a likelihood of causing serious harm in a range of ways, the
likelihood of
this being so significant that they need to have their viewpoints monitored and
reported
on; and

2. That the viewpoints of the Deplorables are more likely to cause serious harm

to people
than the viewpoints of the Viewpoint Elites.
Key Points
D. This Bill intimidates the Deplorables by dis-empowering them.
A second form of intimidation comes in the form of threat to interfere. The
threat is leveled to
two parties: Digital Platform Providers and the Deplorables, who are ordinary
users of digital
platforms or services. Threats are made at multiple levels to each of these two
parties.
The threats made to the Digital Platform Providers include:
1. A threat to make highly negative or reputationally damaging records about
their
platforms or services under s18(3),
2. A threat to make an imposition on the business to identify, find, gather and
format the
required information on the Govt.’s behalf under s14 and to inconvenience the
party by
having the records made in the format the Govt requires, not the format that is
most
convenient for the party s14(4) & (7). A further imposition can be made under
s14(5)
requiring additional investigative reporting; and
3. A threat of a civil penalty under a designated infringement notice provision
for a failure to
abide by the rules on a very harsh, day-by-day compounding basis under s 15(3).
Therefore, the threats to the Digital Platform Providers are in relation to
reputational damage,
financial penalties and business inefficiencies that could easily cause
significant financial loss or
insolvency.
The threat to interfere is also being leveled at the Deplorables. Specifically,
the threat is to haul
them before ACMA under s19. It is highly likely this action would cause the
citizen a high level
of stress, perhaps distress, interrupt their life and waste their time.
These people, who ACMA deems might possibly have relevant information or a


-----

relevant
document, will most likely be Deplorables, as described above, because these are
primarily the
people who use the relevant digital platforms.
Furthermore, many of the Deplorables use these digital platforms on an anonymous
basis and
this legislation threatens that privacy.
In ordinary circumstances often there will be some relationship between the
person being
required to appear before ACMA and the author of the so-called mis or
disinformation. In these
cases people will be asked to dob-in or “snitch” on their friends, families or
political co-agitants.
This style of government is reminiscent of the Soviet Union and entirely
un-Australian in
character, where mateship is a commonly held value.

Many people will fail to comply because their personal values or faith (which,

by definition,
overrides obedience to Government laws in the case of a conflict) require them
not to do so.
They will be fined. Something that is entirely unjust.
Key Points
E. This Bill intimidates the Digital Platform Providers by threatening them with
reputational, financial loss or insolvency.
F. This Bill intimidates the ordinary citizen and in particular, the
Deplorables, by
threatening them with potentially time consuming and stressful investigatory
processes, loss of identity privacy and potentially damage to their personal
relationships.
Concern 3 - Legislation too costly to administer
equitably
There are thousands of digital platforms Australians use and tens of thousands (
if not more) of
chat groups. Chat groups, such as on Whatsapp or Signal, are highly likely to be
deemed as
Digital Services because they have “Interactive Features” under s5, and can
hardly be
described as private messaging where there are more than a few people in the
group.
Despite the fact that much of the reporting will be required to be carried out
by the Digital
Platforms, how does the Government expect ACMA to monitor and review these
reports without
spending millions of hard-earned tax payer dollars doing so? Does the Government
really have
this money to burn on solving a problem that can be solved by simply allowing
Australian
citizens to talk freely on digital platforms without intimidation?
Key Points
G. This Bill cannot be administered without significant Federal funding. It is
unclear whether Govt. has considered the scope of what it is actually proposing,
let alone the budget required to administer it.
Concern 4 - The beginning of the end of religious
freedom


-----

Religion often forms the bedrock of an adherents worldview. For example, I am a

Christian and I
believe the Bible is true. The Bible sets out teaching and wisdom on a wide
variety of matters
that are relevant to life. For illustrative purposes, the Bible teaches that:
1. life begins in the womb; and that
2. various actions are sinful, such as committing adultery, the practice of
homosexuality
and dishonoring your parents.
These beliefs are aspects of my faith. They are religious beliefs. However, the
author has little
doubt such beliefs would be regarded as misinformation or disinformation by
ACMA.
There are dozens of other teachings in the Bible that ACMA would likely regard
as
misinformation or disinformation including in relation to the roles of men and
women in family
and church life.
Assuming the Govt does not intend to report on the religious lives of its
citizens (or am I being
too optimistic?), then why are religious services not excluded under s6 and why
is religious
content not included in the definition of Excluded Content?
Key Points
H. Without amendment, this Bill will result in situations where citizens'
religious
lives will be monitored and reported, and citizens will be required to report on
matters of their personal faith. This is highly discriminatory. There must be an
exclusion for religious services under s6 and religious content must be
incorporated in the definition of Excluded Content.
Concern 5 - Inadequate definitions, inadequate law
I will keep my comment here brief because I expect you will receive a
proliferation of responses
on the very obvious point that “Harm” and “Serious Harm” are severely
inadequately defined.
In respect of the definition of “Harm”: Point (b) in relation to “disruption of
public order or society”
could be used to mean absolutely anything. And, where definitions are loose like
this, it is an
absolute certainty the legislation will be used as a partisan political bludgeon
by whichever
political party is in power.
Almost comically, “Serious Harm” is not defined in the Bill at all.
The following examples may fall under the definition of “Serious Harm” given how
broadly
“Harm” is defined:
1. a tweet with an alternative perspective on experimental medicines (see (d))

2. a WhatsApp group post saying the culling of cows makes no appreciable

difference to
the environment (see (e))
3. a post on an alternative news site arguing that Australians should invest in
cryptocurrency (see (f))
The intention of the Bill is therefore extremely unclear.
Key Points


-----

I. Definitions within this Bill have been left dangerously broad, so much so
there is
a high likelihood they will be used as political bludgeons.
Concern 6 - Political speech will become ever so
quiet
This Tweet posted on 1 July 2023 explains the point succinctly:
The irony of dissuading people from controversial public speech by heavy handed
regimes of
monitoring and reporting is that society will never know what harm has been
caused by doing
so.
For example, what medical remedies were never aired? What injustices remained
hidden? What
resentment was never defused before it eventually resulted in violence?

Key Points

J. This legislation will have a chilling effect on Free Speech.
Concern 7 - What is unnecessary can be dangerous
Free speech is the most inexpensive, time-tested and equitable solution for
solving
misinformation and disinformation. It has worked for centuries in the western
world.
Digital platforms have led to a proliferation of viewpoints but I would like to
urge the Govt. to
“have a little faith” in its constituents.
It is an old adage that sunlight is the best disinfectant and whilst this is
true, the reciprocal is
also true - lack of open communication infects a society with misinformation.
When Governments act like tyrannical controlling parents all they achieve is
resentful and
increasingly disobedient children. The brightest talent will find less dystopian
countries to move
to and those who remain will only become increasingly embittered. This is
already taking place
in Canada with many free thinking professionals and intellectuals moving to
countries where
they can access a free, unhindered press.
Freedom is at the heart of Western democracies, it allows the dialectic that
self-regulates
society.
The authoritarian act of breathing down citizens' necks will only drive
controversial
conversations underground and offline. There, they can fester and become
dangerous.
Key Points
K. Free Speech will be more effective in eradicating misinformation and
disinformation over time than what is being proposed in this Bill. Furthermore,
this Bill will simply drive that extremely small percentage of dangerous
conversations underground. This will put society at greater risk.

Concern 8 - Breach of UN Convention on the Rights

of the Child
It is well recognised that the act of formulating a thought and expressing it is
part of the human
learning process. This Bill would filter information in such a way that children
could not carry out


-----

their own sense-making process based on as-diverse-as-possible viewpoints.
Imagine children’s
first thoughts and ideas posted online only to be labeled as “misinformation”.
What do you think
that is going to do to a child’s confidence? Would they bother writing publicly
again after
receiving a message like that?
Concern 9 - The Guidance Note has misled the
public
The Guidance Note states on Page 7:
However, there are multiple clear pathways to the Bill becoming legislation that
would require
digital platforms to remove individual pieces of content. A post by Thomas Reid,
included below,
describes these pathways very clearly. I summarise:
1. ACMA selects the organisations that write the misinformation code under s32.
2. The code binds the platforms.
3. ACMA may require remedial action for non-compilance with the code under s44.
4. Remedial action can include removal of posts because this action is not
excluded, or
preventing them altogether as referred to in s33(3)(a).

Concern 10 - The Bill will cause Pre-Censorship

Digital Platforms will not risk breach of the Misinformation Codes by putting
themselves in a
position where they cannot control whether they meet the code or standards under
Section 44
or Section 54. Accordingly, it is highly likely that platforms that are able to,
will create
AI-powered systems to pre-censor posts before they are published to the site.
This will cause a huge amount of frustration and resentment amongst people who
have
something they feel that is important to say but are unable to.

This is already happening in Canada, with Facebook banning news on its

platform, in a practical
response to Bill C-11. Here are two examples:

For smaller platforms, it simply will not be financially viable to create the

systems, policies and
software to carry out the enforcement, recording and reporting that the code and
standards
require. These platforms will disappear or become insolvent. The diversity of
digital media,
particularly news media, will shrink significantly towards those with the
capital to develop
automated compliance systems.
Concern 11 - Indigenous Voice
My family has supported Indigenous causes for three generations.
Indigenous stories and beliefs go back hundreds to thousands of years. It is
well understood
that these form an important part of the worldview of many indigenous people.
Indigenous knowledge is sometimes scientifically validated but other times it is
more of a belief
set which indigenous people understand as true in a practical or, according to
their own
perspective, spiritual sense.


-----

I am concerned that the latter is not excluded content. I don’t think any
indigenous person wants
their indigenous knowledge classified as misinformation because it is not
scientifically untrue or
contested.
Concern 12 - Potential for catastrophic public health
implications

I quote a tweet by Professor Kerryn Phelps AM that is self-evidently true and

extremely
important:
Knowledge evolves over time.
How does it evolve?
Step 1: It is communicated
Step 2: It is listened to
Step 3: It is disagreed with
Step 4: It is responded to
Step 5: A new proposition is devised
(repeat)
The censorship and intimidation that will follow the enactment of Misinformation
legislation will
kill this process at Step 1.
The concern appears to have been best put forwards by AMPS VP, Dr Duncan Syme
when he
recently told Canberra Weekly, “What is thought to be correct in medicine one
day will be wrong
the next and vice versa.”

This concludes my 12 reasons and I thank you for taking the time to read my

submission to the
end.
There is perhaps only one more thing to say at this time..
Please Anthony Albanese, I plead with you, withdraw this Bill.
