#### Ms Nerida O'Loughlin PSM, Chair of the ACMA,  Ms Creina Chapman, Deputy Chair  And part-time, full-time, and associate members  Australian Communications and Media Authority Email: info@acma.gov.au 

 Dear Authority Members,

 Some points to consider in a Submission to the ACMA regarding the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 There are serious concerns with the defintion of terms disinformation and misinformation as described in the Bill. As has been seen so often a clause to the effect that ‘for the purposes of this Act certain words have specific meanings …’ and these definitions may be at odds with the meaning of those words in general use.

 Who decides what information fulfills that criteria? Will a panel of ‘experts’ populated with ACMA employees have the sole discretion on adjudicating as to whether an online comment meets a convenient definition as might be determined from time to time? How will these people know, a priori, what is factual in a developing situation where provable facts are not yet available?

 Why are governments, educational institutions and mainstream media enterprises exempt but not independent journalists?

 In a genuine emergency situation, when control of information may be deemed apropriate to prevent unnecessary loss of life, existing legislation is sufficient to prevent hostile actors from diseminating potentially harmful propaganda.

 By imposing regulations and penalties on platform providors to implement censorship and sanctions on users depends on them to correctly interpret those regulations in any given circumstance and effectively co-opts them as state sponsored thought police.

 It cannot be known with certainty what information is truthfull or not at the time it may be publicised, that is often only apparent in hindsight, which is why freedom of speech is absolutely important in any society, let alone one whose government espouses western, liberal, democratic principles

 As has been seen during the alleged Covid pandemic, control of the contagious pathogenic virus narrative, certain bad actors were intent on imposing a dangerous and unsound ideology. They were aided and abetted by mainstream media, social media, government propaganda, the so-called ‘Nudge Units’ and celebrity endorsements,. These caused massive harm to the global population and without an effective alternative access to factual information it would undoubtably have been much worse. This is ample evidence, if it was ever needed, to to demonstrate why people should be free to express their doubts about information which vested interests are promulgating


-----

#### Why should a company wishing to profit from the sale of their product be allowed to use whatever medium they choose, to make claims which are often exagerated at the very least if not outright deceitful, and yet the public wishing to expose those kinds of mis/dis-information are being hampered by government intervention?

 The ACMA is behaving like a captured regulator intent on serving the interests of the global elites rather than the public they claim to serve. A regime which stifles dissent leaves itself open to accusations of tyrannical totalitarian dictatorship as embodied by the worst fascist and communist regimes whose policies are harmful not only to their own citzens but other cultures as well, which World Wars and perpetual regional conflicts are testement to. What is the point of whistleblower protection laws if there is no venue for the whistle to be heard.

 There is no justification for imposing restrictive policies and or regulations on the expression of ideas, even erroneous ones, on the avenues of social communication. If there is doubt about the veracity of claims then each can be challenged and debated on its merits. If claims are found to be actually harmful, such as ‘water fluoridation safe and effective for all’ then they can be dealth with using existing laws. Oh, but wait, that’s right, fluoridationists are a protected class! Exemptions to laws are contrary to the principles of the Rule of Law.

 The competition for new ideas is in essence the history of the world, these regulations if implemented as intended would effectively end humanities struggle to achieve the realisation of its potential. The end of history itself! Are we there yet? The predatory elites no doubt would like us to think so.

 When the public cannot raise issues of concern with decision-makers there needs to be avenues for peacefully raising awareness amongst the general public and thereby harness support for an issue which may affect many in the community.

 Once a Government, or indeed any individual or group appoints themselves the sole unacountable arbiter of truth, they have effectively abondoned any pretence of adhering to democratic principles and become a target for those wishing to exploit the vast potential for abuse.

 If the expresion of an unpopular idea on a digital platform by a member of the public can be criminalised then it can’t be far behind when any form of form of individual expression will be outlawed. This may not be limited to the written or spoken word but to any form including praphic art, music, movement, apparel even a gesture or facial expression. Any perceived infringement upon the ‘rules’ would no doubt incurr a demerit score. Like mindless automotons of one mind, a hive mentality of uniform compliance in thought and deed serving the controlling elite. A global population in Lock-Step with some dystopian Master Plan.

 If only the public could impose on government such regulation in relation to campaign speaches, Parliamentary debates and bearaucratic decisions, demanding they be fact-checked and all decions and policies be transparent. Now that would be something worth regulating!


-----

#### Who would be qualified to be a Fact-Checker for comments regarded as mis/dis- information? No doubt they would have to be licensed by the Government. Just look at how much Covid fact-checking turned out to be merely opinion, later proven wrong.

 A Government that fears dissent is obviously trying to do something which is, by definition, something they would rather the public not know about, and therefore the precise reason the public should know. When secrecy is de-rigour, then corruption is sure to be festering.

 Restriction of contact is recognised as a symptom of coercive control, the parallels with abusive relationships is stark evidence that Government attitudes to the public is toxic.

 To quote one noted digital media platform proprietor, ‘… [it] is the digital town square, where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated’, these facilities are the online meeting places where people can gather to converse. Is it appropriate for the government to be evesdropping on every conversation and collecting evidence against its critics.

 In Nazi Gernmany they burned books to destroy knowledge, with these laws the books will be burnt before they are printed.

 I therfore apend the letter from ‘The people’s Revolution’ which I wholehearted endorse, to my submission.

 Thank you for making this opportunity available and for considering my comments.

 Kind Regards

 Bernard Needham Member of the Commonwealth of Australia Under the Constitution of 1901 as Proclaimed and Gazetted

Ms Nerida O'Loughlin PSM, Chair of the ACMA,


Ms Creina Chapman, Deputy Chair


And part-time, full-time, and associate members

Australian Communications and Media Authority


Email: info@acma.gov.au


Dear Authority Members,

We write in response to the ACMA’s request for feedback on the proposed Communications

Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill). Within

the supporting documentation provided for the Bill, ACMA represents disinformation and

misinformation as posing “a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our

democracy, society and economy.” To deal with this purported issue, at ACMA’s recommendation,

the Australian Government has proposed amendments within the Bill that confer the following

powers to the ACMA:

  - enable the ACMA to gather information from, or require digital platform providers to keep

certain records about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation

  - enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to

combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could

register and enforce

  - allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation),

should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and

disinformation on digital platforms.

Upon consideration of the Bill, numerous issues emerge. In this submission, we will focus on four

key concerns.

1- The Vague Definition of Misinformation and Disinformation

2- The Inadequate Definition of Harm

3- A Deficiency of Excluded Content

4- The Worrying Extent of Control Over Digital Platforms

We will deal with each of these in turn.


-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

**1- The Vague Definition of Misinformation and Disinformation**

Under the provided definitions for the two terms, to be classified as either misinformation or

disinformation, a given content must contain information that is false, misleading or deceptive, not

be excluded content, must be shared with end users in Australia, and be reasonably likely to cause

or contribute to serious harm. In the case of Disinformation, there is an added element of an intent

to deceive by the person disseminating the information.

We contend that this definition is unacceptably broad, particularly given the extent to which the

powers conferred within this Bill will come to infringe on the public’s ability to not only speak, but

have access to information, and think freely. It utterly fails to provide, either through gross oversight

or deliberate omissions, details on:

a) what constitutes false or misleading information, i.e.: how is this determined?

b) Who decides whether the content satisfies the harm component and what determinants

will be used to do so?

c) What are the checks and balances to guard against arbitrary determinations in regards to

the above?

d) Who determines what subject matter will fall within the purview of this act? What would

their selection criteria be? I.e.: on what basis will these topics be qualified?

e) How is the severity gauged for the potential impact of the dissemination of the identified

information?

Without answers to these pertinent questions to clarify the definition of these two terms upon which

the Bill is premised, the powers conferred by this Bill in essence amount to:

- Arbitrary powers to dictate and curtail speech,

- Infantilising the public, with the implication that they are incapable of thinking and reasoning

for themselves; and too stupid to effectively assess a given information and gauge its

veracity.

- A collusion of the public and private realm in a manner no different to fascism to control

the ability of the public to contribute and access a variety of information and opinions,

particularly from sources not directly regulated or controlled in some way by the state (as

demonstrated by the fact that independent media is not listed under the excluded content

_for misinformation purposes category)._

Other than the obvious danger to the effective running of our democracy that this causes, between

2020 and 2022, countless people were shadow-banned, deplatformed, or otherwise censored by

these media companies for making statements that later proved to be correct. And they were


-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

censored for no other reason than that their posts went against the narrative of the state, against

that of the major corporations who stood to profit from the fear, and that of multinational

organisations with their own agendas.

The following is a clear example. The CDC came out with the following:

##### “The CDC’s COVID-19 prevention recommendations no longer differentiate based on a

 person’s vaccination status because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally

 mild, and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree

 of protection against severe illness from their previous infection." [1]

A year before and the year following this release, anyone who stated this fact was deplatformed,

called a conspiracy theorist, and otherwise ridiculed. One can therefore see how the powers of this

bill will be utilised to censor those who have opinions and positions contrary to what the

government and other interested institutions want them to have, regardless of the truth of a post.

The censorship regime that will be effectuated by the powers in this Bill will prevent the public

from alerting their fellow members of the community to valid information that may not yet be known

to the state and its agents. This has an added cost to the governmental response system to crises

and to the economy at large by stunting the public’s ability to work together and look after one

another thereby reducing the burden on public infrastructures.

**2- The Inadequate Definition of Harm**

Under Schedule 1, point (b) of the definition of harm, it is stated:

   - (b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;

What is considered a disruption of public order or society? Does this cover lawful public

demonstrations or protests? If not, does this not violate point ( c ) under the same definition?

   - Point (c) states the following: harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or

of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions;

Is it not the case that by not adding protests and advertising for protests under ‘the excluded

_content for misinformation purposes’ heading, will result in harming the integrity of the Australian_

democratic process? Is it not the case that protests are an important format for the public to express

opinions and grievances on a particular topic where other attempts at being heard have failed? It

-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

is indisputable that protesting is an essential mechanism that allows the people to bring matters of

concern to the attention of those in positions of authority as well as to the broader public. Any

action that inhibits the public’s right to voice their issues falls afoul of the liberal democratic process.

**3- A Deficiency of Excluded Content**

As is currently provided, the list of _excluded content for misinformation purposes has a set of_

glaring and concerning omissions.

**1-** Independent News Organisations that are not regulated or controlled by the state either

directly or indirectly.

**2-** Independent Journalists.

**3-** Content relating to the undertaking and discharging of democratic rights.

There is no freedom of the press, nor can Australia’s purported democratic system of governance

be properly implemented where the only information the public is able to access is that which is

sanctioned by the state and its ancillaries. The importance of independent journalism goes without

saying, particularly when much of the truth that the greater public accesses often comes from

sources independent from the state.

It is an insult to our intelligence to pretend that state sanctioned communications have been or

are for any purpose other than to paint a narrative that benefits the state’s interests and the

interests of those the state aligns with. It is also an insult to our collective intelligence to pretend

that the state and legacy media themselves are not some of the biggest peddlers of lies, half
truths, deceptive information, disinformation and misinformation.

This bill is nothing other than a poorly concealed effort to shut down and control any voices

that would otherwise unveil the lies, propaganda, and manipulations of the state and its various

apparatus of control. If the three years of covid-19 and the ensuing state abuses of power have

taught us anything, the state and its controlled institutions do not have the best interest of

Australians at heart; the Australian government is willing to lie and in so doing cost thousands of

Australians their lives, cost countless others their livelihoods and mental health, not to mention the

overall stability of the Australian society.

One can therefore say that it is instead the Australian public who needs a mechanism to fact

check and verify any and all information propagated by all governmental and state institutions using

sources not connected to, controlled by, nor influenced by the state.

Although the Bill includes Section 60 which acknowledges a protection of the implied right of

political communication, the rulings in the High Court on this topic have made it clear that this is

not a personal right to free speech. It is instead restrictions on legislative and executive power in


-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

regards to laws and actions that would interfere with free communication about government in so

far as said communication jeopardises the structure of government as reflected in the constitution

(i.e.: that the Commonwealth parliament being directly chosen by the people and the people

changing the constitution by vote…).

Thus, section 60 will not provide any protection to disenfranchised members of the public with

the need to express political views that may be contrary to the mainstream and institutional political

position.

Although part of the amendment recommended for parts following subsection 4(3AB) of the

_Broadcasting Services Act 1992, is to:_

(a) have regard to freedom of expression;

This is meaningless given that there is neither an implicit nor explicit right to freedom of expression

in the Constitution of Australia.

**4- Extent of Control Over Digital Platforms (and by extension over all content on all**

**digital platforms of import to public discourse)**

At Division 2, Section 14, it is posited that the ACMA may make digital platform rules in relation to

records. The parametres provided give no specifications on what exactly is meant by ‘records.’

Would the records be of the names and other private details of the users? Would it include all or

some of the posts of the users? Or would the records include the posts considered to be of issue?

The lack of details around this is in itself telling. This forces a substantial burden onto digital

platforms to not only track, but also record all engagements on their platforms and provide it to the

state at the state’s behest. Needless to say, this can and will easily be abused to target and silence

political dissidents. It will also be an irresistible target for scope creep.

Other questions arise upon further considerations of this section:

1(d) says digital platforms may be required to make and retain records relating to

“measures implemented by the provider to prevent or respond to misinformation or disinformation

_on the service, including the effectiveness of the measures;”_

What is the extent of the measures expected from the platforms to prevent/respond to

“misinformation” and “disinformation”? How are these balanced in relation to the privacy of the

users? Where are the considerations for the public’s best interest? What guarantees or processes

have been provided for the public to appeal a finding and control their own data? What guarantees

have been provided for the judicious use of the public’s data?


-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

The stipulations under section 14(2) regarding reporting in essence make the social media

platforms ancillary to the state. The latter having absolute say over what records must be kept,

how they are kept, and how those records are to be reported to the government and when.

Further, being private entities, their required activities under the Bill will be beyond the

scope of the Freedom of Information requests and the associated scrutiny. This is of great concern

given that the subject matter is clearly an issue of great import and interest to the public.

Below are further questions raised by other sections of the Bill:

**Section 33, under examples of matters that may be dealt with by misinformation/disinformation**

standards; subsection (f) mentions supporting fact checking.

   - Who decides what is fact and what is not?

   - Who fact checks the fact checkers given how absolutely wrong many fact checks have

been discovered to be once provable contrary information has come to light? And

considering that the fact checking has been utilised to censor information that contradicts

the state position regardless of their veracity, how can this process be trusted without the

public’s ability to appeal and fact check these supposed arbiters of truth?

**Section 37, regarding the registration of codes, it proposes that where an industry body can come**

up with their own codes to regulate misinformation on the platforms, the ACMA will review in order

to see whether the code “burdens freedom of political communication, and if so whether the burden

is reasonable and not excessive having regard to any circumstances the ACMA considers

relevant…”

   - What is a reasonable burden on freedom of political communication? How is this

determined?

   - How is this standard applied to the codes the ACMA will develop given that protests, which

are part and parcel of political communication, are not excluded content for the purposes

of misinformation and disinformation? It is granted that section 45 has a general

requirement for the consideration of freedom of political communication. However, how will

this be applied when, as previously discussed, this freedom is not an individual freedom of

speech?

**Section 49 proposes that the ACMA may determine standards and impose significant civil**

penalties for a digital platform’s failure to remedy a partial failure of their misinformation code.


-----

# THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY 

### thepeoplesrevolution.com.au

   - Can the ACMA, following approval of a code developed by an industry body, change their

standards at a later date, then take the existing code to be deficient and then request for

the code to be updated?

   - If so, under what circumstances will the ACMA amend its codes?

   - Will there be a public consultation in regards to those amendments?

**Section 50 partially answers one of the previous questions raised by section 49 in regards to the**

changing of standards. It offers that the ACMA can determine a new standard where they deem it

necessary or convenient that “(b) there are exceptional and urgent circumstances justifying the

determination of the standard under this clause; and (c )- it is likely that a code dealing with that

matter or matters could be developed under this Part within a reasonable period in the

circumstances.

   - What criteria will be used to determine a circumstance as “urgent” and or “exceptional?”

   - What guarantees do the public have that this clause will not be utilised without just cause

to declare emergencies and wield the power of the state against the public and political

dissidents?

**Conclusion**

Overall, this is an ill-conceived bill whose primary purpose is to establish a ‘ministry of truth’ that

will ensure that no opposing voices to the political apparatus can utilise public spaces or any other

effective digital communications platform to speak; whilst propping up all structures and

organisations that will act as the mouthpiece for the state. This bill renders onto ACMA the type of

powers that mirrors the CCP’s chokehold on the dissemination of information in China. It is hard

to believe that powers such as these are being proposed in a “liberal democracy.” Perhaps it is

time that the Australian government drop the pretence, and admit to the Australian people that

they now live under a communist inspired government, that the government’s role model is the

Chinese system, and that the Australian government moving forwards will be controlling what the

public sees, hears, thinks, choses, what opinions we are allowed to have, and which ones will

result in persecution.

Needless to say, the Australian people strongly oppose this bill and everything it stands

for, regardless of what it purports to be. The truth is explicit in the omissions and the lack of

clarifications on key sections that have been left open for what can only be assumed to be nefarious

use and abuse. Additionally, there is a clear lack of a structure that actually gives the public the

power and freedom to judge for themselves what information they believe and which ones they do


-----

 PEACE & POWER IN UNITY

not. We utterly reject the presumption that we are too stupid to make such calls for ourselves, and

resent the imputation of such.

This bill is an abomination and if it is to pass, it will see the descent of this great nation into

fascism the likes of which even Stalin and Mao could not conceive of in their wildest dreams. We

the Australian people have noted this ill-disguised attempt at control over our minds and every

thought.

The circulation and availability of potentially conflicting information in public spaces is akin

to foreign items that would cause a person’s immune system to respond. The mopping up of these

items is what a functioning immune system does on a daily basis, and it is these regular challenges

that strengthen the immune system. By contrast, an immune system that is not exposed to

pathogens becomes weakened. In the same way, the community needs to be able to compare

and evaluate information for themselves, and to do their own active critical thinking without being

babied by the state.

For the sake of our communities and the national interest in addition to the concerns listed

earlier, this Bill should be either amended to provide public safeguards or discarded in its

**entirety.**

Regards,

THE PEOPLE’S REVOLUTION
