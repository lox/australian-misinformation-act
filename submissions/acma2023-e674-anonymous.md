I am writing to make a submission regarding the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. I find this proposed legislation deeply concerning, even going so far as to say that it is an assault on the
bedrock principles of a democratic society.

The bill grants excessive power to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to regulate and restrict the public's ability
to access diverse perspectives and make informed judgments (based on unacceptably broad definitions of “misinformation”,
“disinformation” and “harm”), while at the same time exempting all governmental publications from scrutiny.

The vagueness of the standards as well as the severity of the proposed fines threatened in this bill will cause digital platforms to
actively shut down any discussions or opinions which could possibly be considered controversial – limiting the public's ability to
challenge prevailing narratives and engage in meaningful debate.

This would be terribly unfortunate, because a society that values free speech must be willing to protect even the most unpopular
opinions – as long as they are stated in good faith and are not threatening or libellous – because the exchange of ideas is essential
for intellectual growth, societal progress, and the protection of individual rights.
Free speech enables people to think deeply about what they believe and defend or establish arguments and healthy discussion.
This creates an environment for many to hear the different facets of a particular matter and make an informed choice or opinion.
Might I suggest that rather than resorting to government intervention and regulation and relying on a fallible centralized authority to
determine what is and what is not acceptable, we should trust in the capacity of individuals to exercise critical thinking and
personal responsibility when assessing controversial ideas. Anything more than this should have no place in a free country.

I urge the Department to safeguard the marketplace of ideas, foster a society where diverse viewpoints can coexist, and
champion the unalienable right of every individual to freely express his thoughts and beliefs in good faith. This is why I call on you
to strip this bill of its Orwellian-style control.

Yours sincerely,
