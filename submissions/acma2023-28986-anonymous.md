Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)

Bill 2023.

I am writing to absolutely appose the prosect of such a bill or legislation being introduced in Australia;
further, I relay my utter dismay and disappointment that this current government, voted in by the
Australian people and trusting their future and further future generations to a free democratic society
under their watch and governance is under threat of succumbing instead to a communistic type
dictatorship.

We have enjoyed, as have our ancestors who fought for such, a free democratic society and such a law
will stop our liberty to have freedom of speech and a breech of our ‘God’ given human rights.

To even suggest such legislation is an insult to the Australian people’s integrity to decide or discern for
themselves what is fact or fiction, truth or untruth.

Australian Federal Senators that represent ‘the citizens’ and have pledged to serve same should, through
conscious, if nothing else, absolutely vote NO to this discriminatorily Proposed Disinformation Bill.
Indeed, it should not even be tabled, instead, it should be withdrawn and shredded!

Yours Sincerely,


-----
