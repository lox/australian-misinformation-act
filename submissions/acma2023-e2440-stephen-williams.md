Re the proposed ACMA powers in regard to 'Misinformation'

Even though these proposed new powers to determine 'misinformation' maybe well intentioned, they are
a tyrant's dream. The first thing any totalitarian does is to censor his opponents, a free society allows
anyone to put their point of view, even if it's wrong or deceptive, and lets people discuss and argue about
it. Stopping that free speech will stop any point of view that the government of the day doesn't like, no
matter if it's true or not.

The other point is that societies, governments and any group of people can become trapped in a paradigm
where they firmly believe in what seems to them to be 'truth', anyone who speaks against their truth is
ostracised or worse. The problem is that those speaking against the 'truth' may well be right but if they're
silenced no one will ever know and that society could be trapped in a bad situation for a long, long time.

For example, the attitudes towards Gays etc up to recent times. Gays were persecuted, imprisoned and
worse for many centuries, gay literature etc was banned and so was promoting sexual equality for them. If
the people in power had been able to ban, fine and or imprison those who spoke for gay rights then we
may well be living in a society no different than that in the 1950s'. Those people in power genuinely
believed that they were right and were protecting society from something they saw as evil and
undesirable, they could have been acting from the best of motives but at the same time harming people.

These powers will have the same effect, unjustly stopping the free expression of ideas, they will stop the
development of our society and trap us in a state where change will prove difficult if not impossible. No
society can ban free speech and evolve and change and improve.
