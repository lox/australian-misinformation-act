# Feedback on an exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
 Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

_The pace the people are losing their common sense is frightening._

I believe the proposal is a risk to democracy and an abuse of its principles. It is anticonstitutional and its lawfulness is doubtful. I strongly object to it for the following reasons:

INCONSISTENCIES INCOMPATIBILITY (NON-CONFORMANCE) AND LEGALITY

It is difficult to find satisfactory descriptions of misinformation and disinformation. Definitions
of both terms in Subclause 7 appear to be vague, and incomplete and seem to be provided
specifically for the use of the Bill. They are open for interpretation, and potentially for misuse.

This matter carries the danger of further equipping the rulers with the powers of having
arbitrary 'final say' without providing valid and acceptable scientific evidence. There appears to
be little information on who and how will determine that the information is ‘false’, ‘misleading’,
or ‘deceptive’. safeguards are required against mishandling. Is the Bill sufficiently clear about
this?

There appears to be no safeguard against mistaking 'misinformation' for the 'proper'
information and against broad misinterpretation and possibly abuse.

DEFICIENCIES AND ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

Decision-makers are supposed to rely on guidance provided by science, technology, and experts.
This advice may potentially be misinterpreted or mislead. There are numerous proven cases
when ‘approved’ advice turned out to be incorrect. The last 3 years have demonstrated that
information that guided decision-makers was in fact the very mis-information. Excessive
numbers of deaths caused by wrongly adopted advice about preventative measures are
unmistakable proof. Mis-information was adopted based on advice provided by experts and
computer modeling. This eventually instigated an ongoing debate, while people continue to die.

The above raises concern that misinformation may potentially be arbitrarily adopted by
decision-makers as 'righteous' and consequently cause harm. In the One World global
government scenario the harm caused by a mistake could be huge and devastating. And this is
contrary to the purpose of this exercise.

This legislation would require the government to consistently control all its tiers and agencies to
ensure fairness. This would raise numerous concerns.

One of the significant traps is uncertainty if all government instrumentalities are clear about
what is right and what is wrong. For example, - in the futuristic digital world - will all agencies
agree that 50% grey is black, not white?

HUMAN RIGHTS AND EGALITARIANISM

The Bill is potentially in breach of Section 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which grants rights to everyone to freely express opinion.

Freedom of speech is the fundamental right and strength of a healthy democratic society. Free
speech and informed debate are the greatest achievements of the modern free world and must
be preserved at all costs. Every piece of information has its value and everyone should be free
to share it. Denying or tampering with freedom of expression is a sign of poor authority and a
potential lead-up to dictatorship. Instead of filtering or restricting information, measures to be
strengthened to improve safeguards against misuse and harmful effects. The focus should be on
making people aware of the consequences and penalties of providing information that – at
some stage - may prove harmful. The requirements to provide the identity of the sender,
references, and advice about implications may need to be further explored. A system of
warnings (e.g., a statement 'this is my personal opinion') or a need to provide sources is
supported to assist with interpretation.

All references may include elements of 'misinformation' as not all resources will be flawless. The
focus should be on facilitating the proper interpretation of data by recipients comprehensively
with the participation of a broad range of competent entities. A good educational system is
advantageous in such instances. Educated people are more likely to evaluate information
accurately, therefore eliminating misinformation and minimizing any harm.

The last thing the community would accept is an arbitrary delivery of unchallenged and
unverified authoritarian ‘opinion’ which would then be called 'information'.

Overall, it is my opinion, that the disadvantages of the proposed amendment would outnumber
the advantages, if any, and is unwarranted. It could potentially have serious adverse
consequences on the fabric of modern society. It would also create a logistic nightmare in
practical implementation. Instead, the focus should be on promoting community awareness and
education and securing reasonable control of sources and providers of the information. Data
providers to be required to do so in a responsible manner with consequences of wrongdoings
outlined adequately. By no means people should be denied the right to express their opinion.
Overregulating has many long-term adverse effects and is not supported.

It is simply not possible to turn all shades of gray into black and white.

I strongly oppose the introduction of the proposed laws.
