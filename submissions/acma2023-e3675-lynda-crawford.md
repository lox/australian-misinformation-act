Please feel free to publish my submission, but not my email or address. Thankyou.

To Whom It May Concern,

I feel very strongly that this legislation is a move in completely the wrong direction. Freedom of speech will be
curtailed as a result, as it already has been over the last few years. I have been censored multiple times purely for
sharing others medical opinions that differ to the mainstream narrative. I find this quite chilling!
Just the mere name of the bill is a red flag. Misinformation/disinformation have been heavily touted since the
beginning of “The Pandemic” and become nearly as frequent as the term Antivaxxer which is used liberally to
describe anyone who is looking at the science and asking questions. We absolutely must keep our children and
general population safe from sinister agendas such as pedophilia, sexual abuse, drugs, bullying and hate speech.
However, I doubt this bill will have much affect on these problems. I believe the main effect will be to censor any
information that is not in line with the government, WEF or UN agenda. This could lead to the public only being
exposed to the one narrative on issues such as the voice, climate change, covid, medical treatments, just to name a
few. I feel that this is completely unacceptable and a violation of our basic human rights. We must be able to form **_our_**
**_own_** opinions and make **_our_** **_own_** choices after assessing all the information.
How is it possible for a small committee of people to decide what is mis or disinformation? Well, I do not think it is. Not
without bringing an end to science altogether! Science needs to be a fluid arena. A hypothesis is floated, then
eventually proven or disproven and this can change when new information comes to light. There is already an
incredible amount of censorship due to the way funding for research is offered by the pharma-industrial complex and
handful of rich globalists. This bill will create even more censorship and will set a very dangerous precedent!!!
If you take time to read the attached articles, then you will see just a fraction of vital and important information many
Australians were trying to share. If you find them interesting then you will find many others here More Than 400
Studies on the Failure of Compulsory Covid Interventions (Lockdowns, Restrictions, Closures) ★ Brownstone Institute
It was incredibly hard to get this information out to the general population whilst the media and our own government
were speaking about us in a derogatory way, bullying us to make horrendous choices and censoring us senseless.
This legislation will not benefit the average citizen one little bit. It will only benefit big industry, big pharma, and
government. I feel that this will be just the beginning of Totalitarianism in our beautiful Australia.
Please, I beg of you, do not apply any further regulations that will seek to censor the voice of the people any further.
In myopinion it has already had catastrophic results!
Kind Regards,
Lynda Crawford

To the Editor—The outbreak of the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic due to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was declared a pandemic on 12 March
2020 by the World Health Organization

[1]. A major issue related to the outbreak
has been to correlate viral RNA load
obtained after reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct) with
contagiousness and therefore duration
of eviction from contacts and discharge
from specialized infectious disease


wards. Several recent publications, based
on more than 100 studies, have attempted
to propose a cutoff Ct value and duration
of eviction, with a consensus at approximately Ct >30 and at least 10 days, respectively [2–5]. However, in an article
published in _Clinical Infectious Diseases,_
Bullard et al reported that patients could
not be contagious with Ct >25 as the virus
is not detected in culture above this value

[6]. This limit was then evoked in the
French media during an interview with a
member of the French Scientific Council
Covid-19 as a possible value above which
patients are no longer contagious [7].
At the beginning of the outbreak, we
correlated Ct values obtained using our
PCR technique based on amplification of
the E gene and the results of the culture

[8]. Since the beginning of the pandemic,
we have performed 250 566 SARS-CoV-2


RT-PCR for 179 151 patients, of whom
13 161 (7.3%) tested positive. Up to the end
of May, 3790 of these samples, reported
as positive on nasopharyngeal samples,
were inoculated and managed for culture
as previously described [8]. Of these 3790
inoculated samples, 1941 SARS-CoV-2
isolates could be obtained after the first inoculation or up to 2 blind subcultures. The
correlation between the scanner values
and the positivity of the culture allows us
to observe that the image obtained with
10 times more isolates than in our preliminary work (1941 vs 129) does not change
significantly (Figure 1). It can be observed
that at Ct = 25, up to 70% of patients remain positive in culture and that at Ct = 30
this value drops to 20%. At Ct = 35, the
value we used to report a positive result
for PCR, <3% of cultures are positive. Our
Ct value of 35, initially based on the results


**Figure 1.** Percentage of positive viral cultures of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction–positive nasopharyngeal samples from coronavirus disease 2019 patients, according to Ct value (plain line).

samples in our laboratory and initial results of cultures [8], is validated by the results herein presented and is in correlation
with what was proposed in Korea [9] and
Taiwan [10]. We could observe that subcultures, especially the first one, allow an
increasing percentage of viral isolation in
samples with Ct values, confirming that
these high Ct values are mostly correlated
with low viral loads. From our cohort, we
now need to try to understand and define
the duration and frequency of live virus
shedding in patients on a case-by-case
basis in the rare cases when the PCR is
positive beyond 10 days, often at a Ct >30.
In any cases, these rare cases should not
impact public health decisions.

Stringent COVID-19 control measures were imposed in Wuhan between January 23 and April
8, 2020. Estimates of the prevalence of infection following the release of restrictions could
inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, we describe a city-wide SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid screening programme between May 14 and June 1, 2020 in Wuhan. All city
residents aged six years or older were eligible and 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated. No new
symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI
0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified. There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close
contacts of asymptomatic cases. 107 of 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients
tested positive again (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423–0.574%). The prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was therefore very low five to eight weeks after the end of
lockdown.

he Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first
reported in December 2019, and was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,

# T

2020[1]. Following strict lockdown measures, the COVID-19 epidemic was generally under control in China, and the whole
country has progressed into a post-lockdown phase. In this phase,
countries face new problems and challenges, including how to
accurately assess the post-lockdown risk of the COVID-19 epidemic, how to avoid new waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, and
how to facilitate the resumption of economy and normal social
life. As the city most severely affected by COVID-19 in China,
Wuhan had been under lockdown measures from January 23
until April 8, 2020. During the first 2 months after city’s
reopening, there were only a few sporadic COVID-19 cases in
Wuhan (six newly confirmed cases from April 8 to May 10,
2020[2]). However, there was still concern about the risk of
COVID-19 in Wuhan, which seriously affected the resumption of
industrial production and social services, and hampered the
normal lives of residents. In order to ascertain the current status
of the COVID-19 epidemic, the city government of Wuhan carried out a comprehensive citywide nucleic acid screening of
SARS-CoV-2 infection from May 14, 2020 to June 1, 2020.
The citywide screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is
a mass screening programme in post-lockdown settings, and
provided invaluable experiences or lessons with international
relevance as more countries and cities around the world entering
the post-lockdown phase. In this study, we report the organisation process, detailed technical methods used, and results of this
citywide nucleic acid screening.

Results
There were 10,652,513 eligible people aged ≥6 years in Wuhan
(94.1% of the total population). The nucleic acid screening was
completed in 19 days (from May 14, 2020 to Jun 1, 2020), and
tested a total of 9,899,828 persons from the 10,652,513 eligible
people (participation rate, 92.9%). Of the 9899,828 participants,
9,865,404 had no previous diagnosis of COVID-19, and 34,424
were recovered COVID-19 patients.
The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a history of
COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, and
identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases with a detection rate of
0.303 (95% CI 0.270–0.339)/10,000. The median age-stratified Ctvalues of the asymptomatic cases were shown in Supplementary
Table 1. Of the 300 asymptomatic positive cases, two cases came
from one family and another two were from another family.
There were no previously confirmed COVID-19 patients in these
two families. A total of 1174 close contacts of the asymptomatic
positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative for the
COVID-19. There were 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19
cases who participated in the screening. Of the 34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19, 107 tested positive again,
giving a repositive rate of 0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%).
Virus cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and
repositive cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive cases
detected in this study.
All asymptomatic positive cases, repositive cases and their
close contacts were isolated for at least 2 weeks until the
results of nucleic acid testing were negative. None of detected
positive cases or their close contacts became symptomatic or
newly confirmed with COVID-19 during the isolation period.
In this screening programme, single and mixed testing was
performed, respectively, for 76.7% and 23.3% of the collected
samples. The asymptomatic positive rates were 0.321 (95% CI
0.282–0.364)/10,000 and 0.243 (95% CI 0.183–0.315)/10,000,
ti l


The 300 asymptomatic positive persons aged from 10 to 89
years, included 132 males (0.256/10,000) and 168 females (0.355/
10,000). The asymptomatic positive rate was the lowest in children or adolescents aged 17 and below (0.124/10,000), and the
highest among the elderly aged 60 years and above (0.442/10,000)
(Table 1). The asymptomatic positive rate in females (0.355/
10,000) was higher than that in males (0.256/10,000).
The asymptomatic positive cases were mainly domestic and
unemployed residents (24.3%), retired older adults (21.3%), and
public service workers (11.7%) (Fig. 1).
The asymptomatic positive rate in urban districts was on
average 0.456/10,000, ranging from 0.317/10,000 in Hongshan to
0.807/10,000 in Wuchang district. A lower rate of asymptomatic
positive cases was found in suburban districts (0.132/10,000),
ranging from 0.047/10,000 in Xinzhou to 0.237/10,000 in Jiangan
district (Fig. 2).
Among the 7280 residential communities in Wuhan, asymptomatic positive cases were identified in 265 (3.6%) communities
(only one case detected in 246 communities), while no asymptomatic positive cases were found in other 96.4% communities.
Testing of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus was positive
IgG (+) in 190 of the 300 asymptomatic cases, indicating that
63.3% (95% CI 57.6–68.8%) of asymptomatic positive cases were
actually infected. The proportion of asymptomatic positive cases
with both IgM (−) and IgG (−) was 36.7% (95% CI: 31.2–42.4%;
n = 110), indicating the possibility of infection window or false
positive results of the nucleic acid testing (Table 2).
Higher detection rates of asymptomatic infected persons were
in Wuchang, Qingshan and Qiaokou districts, and the prevalence
of previously confirmed COVID-19 cases were 68.243/10,000,
53.767/10,000, and 100.047/10,000, respectively, in the three
districts. Figure 3 shows that districts with a high detection rate of
asymptomatic positive persons generally had a high prevalence of
confirmed COVID-19 cases (rs = 0.729, P = 0.002).

Discussion
The citywide nucleic acid screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
Wuhan recruited nearly 10 million people, and found no newly
confirmed cases with COVID-19. The detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases was very low, and there was no evidence of
transmission from asymptomatic positive persons to traced close
contacts. There were no asymptomatic positive cases in 96.4% of
the residential communities.
Previous studies have shown that asymptomatic individuals
infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were infectious[3], and might
subsequently become symptomatic[4]. Compared with symptomatic patients, asymptomatic infected persons generally have low
quantity of viral loads and a short duration of viral shedding,
which decrease the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2[5]. In the
present study, virus culture was carried out on samples from
asymptomatic positive cases, and found no viable SARS-CoV-2
virus. All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested
negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected
in this study were unlikely to be infectious.
There was a low repositive rate in recovered COVID-19
patients in Wuhan. Results of virus culturing and contract tracing
found no evidence that repositive cases in recovered COVID-19
patients were infectious, which is consistent with evidence from
other sources. A study in Korea found no confirmed COVID-19
cases by monitoring 790 contacts of 285 repositive cases[6].
The official surveillance of recovered COVID-19 patients in
China also revealed no evidence on the infectiousness of repositive cases[7]. Considering the strong force of infection of COVID19[8][–][10], it is expected that the number of confirmed cases is

found that asymptomatic positive rates in different districts of
Wuhan were correlated with the prevalence of previously confirmed cases. This is in line with the temporal and spatial evolution (especially the long-tailed characteristic) of infectious
diseases[11].
Existing laboratory virus culture and genetic studies[9][,][10] showed
that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakening over
time, and the newly infected persons were more likely to be
asymptomatic and with a lower viral load than earlier infected
cases. With the centralized isolation and treatment of all COVID19 cases during the lockdown period in Wuhan, the risk of
residents being infected in the community has been greatly
reduced. When susceptible residents are exposed to a low dose of
virus, they may tend to be asymptomatic as a result of their own


immunity. Serological antibody testing in the current study found
that at least 63% of asymptomatic positive cases were actually
infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, it is too early to be
complacent, because of the existence of asymptomatic positive
cases and high level of susceptibility in residents in Wuhan.
Public health measures for the prevention and control of COVID19 epidemic, including wearing masks, keeping safe social distancing in Wuhan should be sustained. Especially, vulnerable
populations with weakened immunity or co-morbidities, or both,
should continue to be appropriately shielded.
Findings from this study show that COVID-19 was well controlled in Wuhan at the time of the screening programme. After
two months since the screening programme (by August 9, 2020),
there were no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan.

pooled sensitivity of 73% (95% CI 68–78%) for nasopharayngeal
and throat swab testing of COVID-19[14]. Testing kits used in the
screening programme were publicly purchased by the government and these kits have been widely used in China and other
countries. Multiple measures were taken to possibly minimise
false negative results in the screening programme. For example,
standard training was provided to health works for sample collection to ensure the sample quality. The experiment procedures,

false negative results remained possible, particularly in any mass
screening programmes. However, even if test sensitivity was as
low as 50%, then the actual prevalence would be twice as high as
reported in this study, but would still be very low. Around 7.1% of
eligible residents did not participate in the citywide nucleic acid

study. Although there were no official statistics, a large number of
migrant workers and university students left Wuhan before the
lockdown, joining their families in other cities or provinces for
traditional Chinese New Year. Therefore, it is likely that most
nonparticipants were not in Wuhan at the time of the screening.
The main objective of the screening programme was to assess the
risk of COVID-19 epidemic in residents who were actually living
in the post-lockdown Wuhan. Therefore, the estimated positive
rates are unlikely to be materially influenced by nonparticipation
of residents who were not in Wuhan or some residents who did
not participate in the screening for other reasons. Moreover,
people who left Wuhan were the target population for monitoring
in other provinces and cities and were required to take nucleic
acid testing. Although there was no official statistics showing the
positive rate of nucleic acid testing in this population, there was
no report that shown a higher positive rate of nucleic acid testing
than our findings.
In summary, the detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases
in the post-lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and
there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive
cases were infectious. These findings enabled decision makers to
adjust prevention and control strategies in the post-lockdown
period. Further studies are required to fully evaluate the impacts
and cost-effectiveness of the citywide screening of SARS-CoV-2
infections on population’s health, health behaviours, economy,
and society.

Methods
Study population and ethical approvals. Wuhan has about 11 million residents
in total, with seven urban and eight suburban districts. Residents are living in 7280
residential communities (or residential enclosures, “xiao-qu” in Chinese), and each
residential community could be physically isolated from other communities for
preventing transmission of COVID-19.
The screening programme recruited residents (including recovered COVID-19
patients) currently living in Wuhan who were aged ≥6 years (5,162,960 males, 52.2%).
All participants provided written or verbal informed consent after reading a statement
that explained the purpose of the testing. For participants who aged 6–17 years old,
consent was obtained from their parents or guardians. The study protocol for an
evaluation of the programme based on anonymized screening data was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Tongji Medical College Institutional Review Board, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (No. IROG0003571).

Organizational guarantee and community mobilization. A citywide nucleic acid
screening group was formed, with specialized task teams contributing to comprehensive coordination, technical guidance, quality control, participation invitation, information management, communication, and supervision of the screening.
The city government invested 900 million yuan (RMB) in the testing programme.
From 14 May to 1 June 2020, in the peak time, up to 2907 sample collection sites
were functioning at the same time in Wuhan. Each sample collection site had an
assigned sample collection group, including several health professionals (staffed
according to the number of communities’ residents), 2–4 community managers,
1–2 police officers, and 1–2 inspectors. The sampling sites were set up based on the
number and accessibility of local residents. Local community workers were
responsible for a safe and orderly sampling process to minimise the waiting time.
In addition, mobile sampling teams were formed by primary health care professionals and volunteers to conduct door-to-door sampling for residents who had
physical difficulties or were unable to walk.
About 50,000 health professionals (mainly doctors and nurses from community
health centers) and more than 280,000 person-times of community workers and
volunteers contributed to sample collection, transport of equipment and samples
collected, arrangement of participation process, and maintaining order of sampling
sites. Public information communication and participant invitation were
implemented through mass media, mobile messages, WeChat groups, and
residential community broadcasts, so as to increase residents’ awareness and the
participation.

Acquisition, preservation, and transport of samples. All sampling personnel
received standard training for the collection of oropharyngeal swab samples. To
minimise the risk of cross-infection, the sampling process strictly followed a disinfection process and environmental ventilation were ensured. The collected
samples were stored in a virus preservation solution or immersed in isotonic saline,
tissue culture solution, or phosphate buffer (Supplementary note 1). Then, all
l i i i i i hi h i d li b f


biological samples refrigerated with dry ice to guarantee the stability of nucleic acid
samples.

Technical methods for laboratory testing of collected samples. A total of 63
nucleic acid testing laboratories, 1451 laboratory workers and 701 testing equipment were involved in the nucleic acid testing. Received samples were stored at
4 °C and tested within 24 h of collection. Any samples that could not be tested
within 24 h were stored at −70 °C or below (Supplementary note 1). In addition to
“single testing” (i.e., separate testing of a single sample), “mixed testing” was also
performed for 23% of the collected samples to increase efficiency, in which five
samples were mixed in equal amounts, and tested in the same test tube. If a mixed
testing was positive for COVID-19, all individual samples were separately retested
within 24 h[15].
Details regarding technical methods for sequencing and virus culture were
provided in Supplementary note 1. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay method was used for the nucleic acid testing. We
simultaneously amplified and tested the two target genes: open reading frame 1ab
(ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Supplementary Note 1). A cycle threshold
value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive result, and no Ct-value or a
Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative result. For Ct-values ranging from
37 to 40, the sample was retested. If the retest result remained less than 40 and the
amplification curve had obvious peak, the sample was classified as positive;
otherwise, it was reported as being negative. These diagnostic criteria were based
on China’s official recommendations[16].
For asymptomatic positive cases, virus culture was carried out in biosafety level3 laboratories. The colloidal gold antibody test was also performed for
asymptomatic positive cases (Supplementary note 1). All testing results were
double entered into a specifically designed database, and managed by the Big Data
and Investigation Group of the COVID-19 Prevention and Control Centre in
Wuhan, which was established to collect and manage data relevant to the COVID19 epidemic.

Participant data collection and management. Before sample collection, residents
electronically (using a specifically designed smartphone application) self-uploaded
their personal information, including ID number, name, sex, age, and place of
residence. Then, the electronic machine system generated a unique personal barcode and stuck it on the sample tube to ensure the match between the sample and
the participant. Then trained staff interviewed each individual regarding the history
of COVID-19 and previous nucleic acid testing. There was a database of confirmed
COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, which can be used to validate the self-reported previous COVID-19 infection. All information was entered into a central database.
The testing results were continually uploaded to the central database by testing
institutions. Contact tracing investigations were conducted on participants who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, to track and manage their close contacts. The preexisting unique identification code for each resident was used as the programme’s
identification number, to ensure information accuracy during the whole process of
screening, from sampling, nucleic acid testing, result reporting, the isolation of
detected positive cases, and tracing of close contacts of positive cases. All screening
information was kept strictly confidential and was not allowed to be disclosed or
used for other purposes other than clinical and public health management. Personal information of asymptomatic positive cases was only disclosed to designated
medical institutions and community health centres for the purpose of medical
isolation and identification of close contacts. Researcher was blind to the study
hypothesis during data collection.

Biological security guarantee. Nucleic acid testing was performed in biosafety
level-2 (BSL-2) laboratories, and virus culture was conducted in biosafety level-3
laboratories. Sampling and testing personnel adopted the personal protective
measures according to the standard of biosafety level-3 laboratories. Participating
laboratories implemented control measures to guarantee biological safety in
accordance with relevant regulations[17].

Result query and feedback. Two to three days after sample collection, participants could inquire about their test results using WeChat or Alipay application by
their unique ID numbers. The results included text descriptions of nucleic acid
testing and coloured health codes. A green coloured health code refers to a negative
result, and a red coloured health code indicates a positive result.

Definition and management of identified confirmed cases and close contacts.
In this study, all confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed by designated medical
institutions according to National Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of
COVID-19 (Supplementary Note 2). Asymptomatic positive cases referred to
individuals who had a positive result during screening, and they had neither a
history of COVID-19 diagnosis, nor any clinical symptoms at the time of the
nucleic acid testing. Close contacts were individuals who closely contacted with an
asymptomatic positive person since 2 days before the nucleic acid sampling[16].
Repositive cases refer to individuals who recovered from previously confirmed
COVID-19 disease and had a positive testing again in the screening programme.

isolated for at least 2 weeks in designated hotels managed by primary health care
professionals, and they were released from isolation only if two consecutive nucleic
acid tests were negative.

Statistical analysis. Detection rate of asymptomatic positive or repositive cases
was calculated by dividing the number of individuals with a positive result of
nucleic acid testing by the number of participants tested. Because of extremely low
detection rates, we calculated 95% confidence intervals of estimated proportions
using Pearson–Klopper exact method, implemented through R package “binom”
version 1.1-1[18]. SPSS version 22.0 was used for other statistical analyses. We
analyzed the distribution of asymptomatic positive cases and assessed the Spearman correlation between the asymptomatic positive rate and the prevalence of
previously confirmed COVID-19 cases in different districts of Wuhan. Differences
in asymptomatic positive rates by sex and age groups were assessed using the χ[2]
test. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to draw a geographic distribution map of asymptomatic
positive cases. A value of P < 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically
significant.

###### Abstract

 This systematic review and meta-analysis are designed to determine whether there is empirical evidence to support the belief that “lockdowns” reduce COVID-19 mortality. Lockdowns are defined as the imposition of at least one compulsory, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). NPIs are any government mandate that directly restrict peoples’ possibilities, such as policies that limit internal movement, close schools and businesses, and ban international travel. This study employed a systematic search and screening procedure in which 18,590 studies are identified that could potentially address the belief posed. After three levels of screening, 34 studies ultimately qualified. Of those 34 eligible studies, 24 qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. They were separated into three groups: lockdown stringency index studies, shelter-in-place- order (SIPO) studies, and specific NPI studies. An analysis of each of these three groups support the conclusion that lockdowns have had little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality. More specifically, stringency index studies find that lockdowns in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average. SIPOs were also ineffective, only reducing COVID-19 mortality by 2.9% on average. Specific NPI studies also find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on COVID-19 mortality. 
 While this meta-analysis concludes that lockdowns have had little to no public health effects, they have imposed enormous economic and social costs where they have been adopted. In consequence, lockdown policies are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.

###### 1 Introduction

 The global policy reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is evident. Compulsory non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), commonly known as “lockdowns” – policies that restrict internal movement, close schools and businesses, and ban international travel – have been mandated in one form or another in almost every country. 

 The first NPIs were implemented in China. From there, the pandemic and NPIs spread first to Italy and later to virtually all other countries, see Figure 1. Of the 186 countries covered by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), only Comoros, an island country in the Indian Ocean, did not impose at least one NPI before the end of March 2020.

 Figure 1: Share of countries with OxCGRT stringency index above thresholds, January - June 2020

_Comment: The figure shows the share of countries, where the OxCGRT stringency index on a given date surpassed index 65, 70_
_and 75 respectively. Only countries with more than one million citizens are included (153 countries in total). The OxCGRT_
_stringency index records the strictness of NPI policies that restrict people’s behavior. It is calculated using all ordinal_
_containment and closure policy indicators (i.e., the degree of school and business closures, etc.), plus an indicator recording_
_public information campaigns._

Our early interest in the subject was spurred by two studies. First, Atkeson et al. (2020) showed that “across all countries and U.S. states that we study, the growth rates of daily deaths from COVID-19 fell from a wide range of initially high levels to levels close to zero within 20-30 days after each region experienced 25 cumulative deaths.” Second, Sebhatu et al. (2020) showed that “government policies are strongly driven by the policies initiated in other countries,” and less by the specific COVID-19-situation of the country. 

 A third factor that motivated our research was the fact that there was no clear negative correlation between the degree of lockdown and fatalities in the spring of 2020 (see Figure 2). Given the large effects predicted by simulation studies such as Ferguson et al. (2020), we would have expected to at least observe a simple negative correlation between COVID-19 mortality and the degree to which lockdowns were imposed.[2]

1 With R0 = 2.4 and trigger on 60, the number of COVID-19-deaths in Great Britain could be reduced to 8,700

deaths from 510,000 deaths (-98%) with a policy consisting of case isolation + home quarantine + social
distancing + school/university closure, cf. Table 4 in Ferguson et al. (2020). R0 (the basic reproduction rate) is the
expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to
infection.

2 In addition, the interest in this issue was sparked by the work Jonung did on the expected economic effects of the

SARS pandemic in Europe in 2006 (Jonung and Röger, 2006). In this model-based study calibrated from Spanish
flu data, Jonung and Röger concluded that the economic effects of a severe pandemic would be rather limited—a
sharp contrast to the huge economic effects associated with lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

###### Today, it remains an open question as to whether lockdowns have had a large, significant effect on COVID-19 mortality. We address this question by evaluating the current academic literature on the relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 mortality rates.[3] We use “NPI” to describe any government mandate which directly restrict peoples’ possibilities. Our definition does not include governmental recommendations, governmental information campaigns, access to mass testing, voluntary social distancing, etc., but do include mandated interventions such as closing schools or businesses, mandated face masks etc. We define lockdown as any policy consisting of at least one NPI as described above.[4]

 Compared to other reviews such as Herby (2021) and Allen (2021), the main difference in this meta-analysis is that we carry out a systematic and comprehensive search strategy to identify all papers potentially relevant to answer the question we pose. We identify 34 eligible empirical studies that estimate the effect of mandatory lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality using a counterfactual difference-in-difference approach. We present our results in such a way that they can be systematically assessed, replicated, and used to derive overall meta-conclusions.[5]

 2 Identification process: Search strategy and eligibility criteria

 Figure 3 shows an overview of our identification process using a flow diagram designed according to PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al. (2009). Of 18,590 studies identified during our database searches, 1,048 remained after a title-based screening. Then, 931 studies were excluded, because they either did not measure the effect of lockdowns on mortality or did not use an empirical approach. This left 117 studies that were read and inspected. After a more thorough assessment, 83 of the 117 were excluded, leaving 34 studies eligible for our meta-analysis. A table with all 83 studies excluded in the final step can be found in Appendix B, Table 8.

3 We use “mortality” and “mortality rates” interchangeably to mean COVID-19 deaths per population.
4 For example, we will say that Country A introduced the non-pharmaceutical interventions school closures and

shelter-in-place-orders as part of the country’s lockdown.

5 An interesting question is, “What damage lockdowns do to the economy, personal freedom and rights, and public

health in general?” Although this question is important, it requires a full cost-benefit study, which is beyond the
scope of this study.

 Below we present our search strategy and eligibility criteria, which follow the PRISMA guidelines and are specified in detail in our protocol Herby et al. (2021).

 2.1 Search strategy

 The studies we reviewed were identified by scanning Google Scholar and SCOPUS for English- language studies. We used a wide range of search terms which are combinations of three search strings: a disease search string (“covid,” “corona,” “coronavirus,” “sars-cov-2”), a government

 6

###### response search string[6], and a methodology search string[7]. We identified papers based on 1,360 search terms. We also required mentions of “deaths,” “death,” and/or “mortality.” The search terms were continuously updated (by adding relevant terms) to fit this criterion.[8]

 We also included all papers published in Covid Economics. Our search was performed between July 1 and July 5, 2021 and resulted in 18,590 unique studies.[9] All studies identified using SCOPUS and Covid Economics were also found using Google Scholar. This made us comfortable that including other sources such as VOXeu and SSRN would not change the result. Indeed, many papers found using Google Scholar were from these sources. 

 All 18,590 studies were first screened based on the title. Studies clearly not related to our research question were deemed irrelevant.[10]

 After screening based on the title, 1,048 papers remained. These papers were manually screened by answering two questions:

 1. Does the study measure the effect of lockdowns on mortality?  2. Does the study use an empirical ex post difference-in-difference approach (see eligibility
 criteria below)? 

 Studies to which we could not answer “yes” to both questions were excluded. When in doubt, we made the assessment based on reading the full paper, and in some cases, we consulted with colleagues.[11]

 After the manual screening, 117 studies were retrieved for a full, detailed review. These studies were carefully examined, and metadata and empirical results were stored in an Excel

6 The government response search string used was: “non-pharmaceutical,” “nonpharmaceutical,” ”NPI,” ”NPIs,”

”lockdown,” “social distancing orders,” “statewide interventions,” “distancing interventions,” “circuit breaker,”
“containment measures,” “contact restrictions,” “social distancing measures,” “public health policies,” “mobility
restrictions,” “covid-19 policies,” “corona policies,” “policy measures.”

7 The methodology search string used was: (“fixed effects,” “panel data,” “difference-in-difference,” “diff-in-diff,”

“synthetic control,” “counterfactual”, “counter factual,” “cross country,” “cross state,” “cross county,” “cross
region,” “cross regional,” “cross municipality,” “country level,” “state level,” “county level,” “region level,”
“regional level,” “municipality level,” “event study.”

8 If a potentially relevant paper from one of the 13 reviews (see eligibility criteria) did not show up in our search, we

added relevant words to our search strings and ran the search again. The 13 reviews were: Allen (2021); Brodeur
et al. (2021); Gupta et al. (2020); Herby (2021); Johanna et al. (2020); Nussbaumer-Streit et al. (2020); Patel et al.
(2020); Perra (2020); Poeschl and Larsen (2021); Pozo-Martin et al. (2020); Rezapour et al. (2021); Robinson
(2021); Zhang et al. (2021).

9 SCOPUS was continuously monitored between July 5th and publication using a search agent. Although the search

agent returned several hits during this period, only one of them, An et al. (2021), was eligible according to our
eligibility criteria. The study is not included in our review, but the conclusions are in line with our conclusions, as
An et al. (2021) conclude that “The analysis shows that the mask mandate is consistently associated with lower
infection rates in the short term, and its early adoption boosts the long-term efficacy. By contrast, the other five
policy instruments— domestic lockdowns, international travel bans, mass gathering bans, and restaurant and
school closures—show weaker efficacy.”

10 This included studies with titles such as “COVID-19 outbreak and air pollution in Iran: A panel VAR analysis”

and “Dynamic Structural Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Stock Market and the Exchange Rate: A
Cross-country Analysis Among BRICS Nations.”

11 Professor Christian Bjørnskov of University of Aarhus was particularly helpful in this process.

###### spreadsheet. All studies were assessed by at least two researchers. During this process, another 64 papers were excluded because they did not meet our eligibility criteria. Furthermore, nine studies with too little jurisdictional variance (< 10 observations) were excluded,[12] and 10 synthetic control studies were excluded.[13] A table with all 83 studies excluded in the final step can be found in Appendix B, Table 8. Below we explain why these studies are excluded.

 2.2 Eligibility criteria

 Focus on mortality and lockdowns We only include studies that attempt to establish a relationship (or lack thereof) between lockdown policies and COVID-19 mortality or excess mortality. We exclude studies that use cases, hospitalizations, or other measures.[14]

 Counterfactual difference-in-difference approach  We distinguish between two methods used to establish a relationship (or lack thereof) between mortality rates and lockdown policies. The first uses registered cross-sectional mortality data. These are ex post studies. The second method uses simulated data on mortality and infection rates.[15] These are ex ante studies. 

 We include all studies using a counterfactual difference-in-difference approach from the former group but disregard all ex ante studies, as the results from these studies are determined by model assumptions and calibrations.

 Our limitation to studies using a “counterfactual difference-in-difference approach” means that we exclude all studies where the counterfactual is based on forecasting (such as a SIR-model) rather than derived from a difference-in-difference approach. This excludes studies like Duchemin et al. (2020) and Matzinger and Skinner (2020). We also exclude all studies based on interrupted time series designs that simply compare the situation before and after lockdown, as

12 The excluded studies with too few observations were: Alemán et al. (2020), Berardi et al. (2020), Conyon et al.

(2020a), Coccia (2021), Gordon et al. (2020), Juranek and Zoutman (2021), Kapoor and Ravi (2020), Umer and
Khan (2020), and Wu and Wu (2020).

13 The excluded synthetic control studies were: Conyon and Thomsen (2021), Dave et al. (2020), Ghosh et al.

(2020), Born et al. (2021), Reinbold (2021), Cho (2020), Friedson et al. (2021), Neidhöfer and Neidhöfer (2020),
Cerqueti et al. (2021), and Mader and Rüttenauer (2021).

14 Analyses based on cases may pose major problems, as testing strategies for COVID-19 infections vary

enormously across countries (and even over time within a given country). In consequence, cross-country
comparisons of cases are, at best, problematic. Although these problems exist with death tolls as well, they are far
more limited. Also, while cases and death tolls are correlated, there may be adverse effects of lockdowns that are
not captured by the number of cases. For example, an infected person who is isolated at home with family under a
SIPO may infect family members with a higher viral load causing more severe illness. So even if a SIPO reduces
the number of cases, it may theoretically increase the number of COVID-19-deaths. Adverse effects like this may
explain why studies like Chernozhukov et al. (2021) finds that SIPO reduces the number of cases but have no
significant effect on the number of COVID-19-deaths. Finally, mortality is hierarchically the most important
outcome, cf. GRADEpro (2013)

15 These simulations are often made in variants of the SIR-model, which can simulate the progress of a pandemic in

a population consisting of people in different states (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered) with equations
describing the process between these states.

###### the effect of lockdowns in these studies might contain time-dependent shifts, such as seasonality. This excludes studies like Bakolis et al. (2021) and Siedner et al. (2020). 

 Given our criteria, we exclude the much-cited paper by Flaxman et al. (2020), which claimed that lockdowns saved three million lives in Europe. Flaxman et al. assume that the pandemic would follow an epidemiological curve unless countries locked down. However, this assumption means that the only interpretation possible for the empirical results is that lockdowns are the only thing that matters, even if other factors like season, behavior etc. caused the observed change in the reproduction rate, Rt. Flaxman et al. are aware of this and state that “our parametric form of Rt assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior.” Flaxman et al. illustrate how problematic it is to force data to fit a certain model if you want to infer the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality.[16]

 The counterfactual difference-in-difference studies in this review generally exploit variation across countries, U.S. states, or other geographical jurisdictions to infer the effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 fatalities. Preferably, the effect of lockdowns should be tested using randomized control trials, natural experiments, or the like. However, there are very few studies of this type.[17]

 Synthetic control studies The synthetic control method is a statistical method used to evaluate the effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. It involves the construction of a synthetic control which functions as the counter factual and is constructed as an (optimal) weighted combination of a pool of donors. For example, Born et al. (2021) create a synthetic control for Sweden which consists of 30.0% Denmark, 25.3% Finland, 25.8% Netherlands, 15.0% Norway, and 3.9% Sweden. The effect of the intervention is derived by comparing the actual developments to those contained in the synthetic control. 

 We exclude synthetic control studies because of their inherent empirical problems as discussed by Bjørnskov (2021b). He finds that the synthetic control version of Sweden in Born et al. (2021) deviates substantially from “actual Sweden,” when looking at the period before mid-March 2020, when Sweden decided not to lock down. Bjørnskov estimates that actual Sweden experienced

16 Several scholars have criticized Flaxman et al. (2020), e.g. see Homburg and Kuhbandner (2020), Lewis (2020),

and Lemoine (2020).

17 Kepp and Bjørnskov (2021) is one such study. They use evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in the Danish

region of Northern Jutland. After the discovery of mutations of Sars-CoV-2 in mink – a major Danish export –
seven of the 11 municipalities of the region went into extreme lockdown in early November, while the four other
municipalities retained the moderate restrictions of the remaining country. Their analysis shows that while
infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was in effect, and infection numbers also decreased in
neighbor municipalities without mandates. They conclude that efficient infection surveillance and voluntary
compliance make full lockdowns unnecessary, at least in some circumstances. Kepp and Bjørnskov (2021) is not
included in our review, because they focus on cases and not COVID-19 mortality. Dave et al. (2020) is another
such study. They see the Wisconsin Supreme Court abolishment of Wisconsin’s “Safer at Home” order (a SIPO)
as a natural experiment and find that “the repeal of the state SIPO impacted social distancing, COVID-19 cases, or
COVID-19-related mortality during the fortnight following enactment.” Dave et al. (2020) is not included in our
review, because they use a synthetic control method.

###### 9

###### approximately 500 fewer deaths the first 11 weeks of 2020 and 4,500 fewer deaths in 2019 compared to synthetic Sweden. 

 This problem is inherent in all synthetic control studies of COVID-19, Bjørnskov argues, because the synthetic control should be fitted based on a long period of time before the intervention or the event one is studying the consequences of – i.e., the lockdown Abadie (2021). However, this is not possible for the coronavirus pandemic, as there clearly is no long period with coronavirus before the lockdown. Hence, the synthetic control study approach is by design not appropriate for studying the effect of lockdowns. 

 Jurisdictional variance - few observations We exclude all interrupted time series studies which simply compare mortality rates before and after lockdowns. Simply comparing data from before and after the imposition of lockdowns could be the result of time-dependent variations, such as seasonal effects. For the same reason, we also exclude studies with little jurisdictional variance.[18] For example, we exclude Conyon et al. (2020b) who “exploit policy variation between Denmark and Norway on the one hand and Sweden on the other” and, thus, only have one jurisdictional area in the control group. Although this is a difference-in-difference approach, there is a non-negligible risk that differences are caused by much more than just differences in lockdowns. Another example is Wu and Wu (2020), who use all U.S. states, but pool groups of states so they end with basically three observations. None of the excluded studies cover more than 10 jurisdictional areas.[19] One study is a special case of the jurisdictional variance criteria (Auger et al. (2020). Those researchers analyze the effect of school closures in U.S. states and find that those closures reduce mortality by 35%. However, all 50 states closed schools between March 13, 2020, and March 23, 2020, which means that all difference-in-difference is based on maximum 10 days. Given the long lag between infection and death, there is a risk that Auger et al.’s approach is an interrupted time series analysis where they compare United States before and after school closures, rather than a true difference-in-difference approach. However, we choose to include this study, as it is eligible under our protocol Herby et al. (2021). 

 Publication status and date We include all ex post studies regardless of publication status and date. That is, we cover both working papers and papers published in journals. We include the early papers because the knowledge of the COVID-19-pandemic grew rapidly in the beginning, making later papers able to stand on the shoulders of previous work. Also, in the early days of COVID-19, speed was

18 A jurisdictional area can be countries, U.S. states, or counties. With "jurisdictional variance” we refer to variation

in mandates across jurisdictional areas.

###### crucial which may have affected the quality of the papers. Including them makes it possible to compare the results of early studies to studies carried out at a later stage.[20]

 The role of optimal timing We exclude papers which analyze the effect of early lockdowns in contrast to later lockdowns. There’s no doubt that being prepared for a pandemic and knowing when it arrives at your doorstep is vital. However, at least two problems arise with respect to evaluating the effect of well-timed lockdowns.

 First, when COVID-19 hit Europe and the United States, it was virtually impossible to determine the right timing. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, but at that date, Italy had already registered 13.7 COVID-19 deaths per million. On March 29, 2020, 18 days after the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic and the earliest a lockdown response to the WHO’s announcement could potentially have an effect, the mortality rate in Italy was a staggering 178 COVID-19 deaths per million with an additional 13 per million dying each day.[21]

 Secondly, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the effect of public awareness and the effect of lockdowns when looking at timing because people and politicians are likely to react to the same information. As Figure 4 illustrates, all European countries and U.S. states that were hit hard and early by COVID-19 experienced high mortality rates, whereas all countries hit relatively late experienced low mortality rates. Björk et al. (2021) illustrate the difficulties in analyzing the effect of timing. They find that a 10-stringency-points-stricter lockdown would reduce COVID-19 mortality by a total of 200 deaths per million[22] if done in week 11, 2020, but would only have approximately 1/3 of the effect if implemented one week earlier or later and no effect if implemented three weeks earlier or later. One interpretation of this result is that lockdowns do not work if people either find them unnecessary and fail to obey the mandates or if people voluntarily lock themselves down. This is the argument Allen (2021) uses for the ineffectiveness of the lockdowns he identifies. If this interpretation is true, what Björk et al. (2021) find is that information and signaling is far more important than the strictness of the lockdown. There may be other interpretations, but the point is that studies focusing on timing cannot differentiate between these interpretations. However, if lockdowns have a notable effect, we should see this effect regardless of the timing, and we should identify this effect more correctly by excluding studies that exclusively analyze timing.

20 We also intended to exclude studies which were primarily based on data from 2021 (as these studies would be

heavily affected by vaccines) and studies that did not cover at least one EU-country, the United States, one U.S.
U.S. state or Latin America, and where at least one country/state was not an island. However, we did not find any
such studies.

21 There’s approximately a two-to-four-week gap between infection and deaths. See footnote 29.
22 They estimate that 10-point higher stringency will reduce excess mortality by 20 “per week and million” in the 10

weeks from week 14 to week 23.

###### We are aware of one meta-analysis by Stephens et al. (2020), which looks into the importance of timing. The authors find 22 studies that look at policy and timing with respect to mortality rates, however, only four were multi-country, multi-policy studies, which could possibly account for the problems described above. Stephens et al. conclude that “the timing of policy interventions across countries relative to the first Wuhan case, first national disease case, or first national death, is not found to be correlated with mortality.” (See Appendix A for further discussion of the role of timing.)

 3 The empirical evidence

 In this section we present the empirical evidence found through our identification process. We describe the studies and their results, but also comment on the methodology and possible identification problems or biases. 

 3.1 Preliminary considerations

 Before we turn to the eligible studies, we present some considerations that we adopted when interpreting the empirical evidence. 

 Empirical interpretation While the policy conclusions contained in some studies are based on statistically significant results, many of these conclusions are ill-founded due to the tiny impact associated with said statistically significant results. For example, Ashraf (2020) states that “social distancing

 12

###### measures has proved effective in controlling the spread of [a] highly contagious virus.” However, their estimates show that the average lockdown in Europe and the U.S only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.4%.[23] Another example is Chisadza et al. (2021). The authors argue that “less stringent interventions increase the number of deaths, whereas more severe responses to the pandemic can lower fatalities.” Their conclusion is based on a negative estimate for the squared term of stringency which results in a total negative effect on mortality rates (i.e. fewer deaths) for stringency values larger than 124. However, the stringency index is limited to values between 0 and 100 by design, so the conclusion is clearly incorrect. To avoid any such biases, we base our interpretations solely on the empirical estimates and not on the authors’ own interpretation of their results.

 Handling multiple models, specifications, and uncertainties Several studies adopt a number of models to understand the effect of lockdowns. For example, Bjørnskov (2021a) estimates the effect after one, two, three, and four weeks of lockdowns. For these studies, we select the longest time horizon analyzed to obtain the estimate closest to the long-term effect of lockdowns. 

 Several studies also use multiple specifications including and excluding potentially relevant variables. For these studies, we choose the model which the authors regard as their main specification. Finally, some studies have multiple models which the authors regard as equally important. One interesting example is Chernozhukov et al. (2021), who estimate two models with and without national case numbers as a variable. They show that including this variable in their model alters the results substantially. The explanation could be that people responded to national conditions. For these studies, we present both estimates in Table 1, but – following Doucouliagos and Paldam (2008) – we use an average of the estimates in our meta-analysis in order to not give more weight to a study with multiple models relative to studies with just one principal model. 

 For studies looking at different classes of countries (e.g. rich and poor), we report both estimates in Table 1 but use the estimate for rich Western countries in our meta-analysis, where we derive common estimates for Europe and the United States.

 Effects are measured “relative to Sweden in the spring of 2020” Virtually all countries in the world implemented mandated NPIs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, most estimates are relative to “doing the least,” which in many Western countries means relative to doing as Sweden has done, especially during the first wave, when Sweden, do to constitutional constraints, implemented very few restrictions compared to other western countries (Jonung and Hanke 2020). However, some studies do compare the effect of doing something to the effect of doing absolutely nothing (e.g. Bonardi et al. (2020)). 

 The consequence is that some estimates are relative to “doing the least” while others are relative to “doing nothing.” This may lead to biases if “doing the least” works as a signal (or warning)

23 We describe how we arrive at the 2.4% in Section 4.

###### 13


-----

###### which alters the behavior of the public. For example, Gupta et al. (2020) find a large effect of emergency declarations, which they argue “are best viewed as an information instrument that signals to the population that the public health situation is serious and they act accordingly,” on social distancing but not of other policies such as SIPOs (shelter-in-place orders). Thus, if we compare a country issuing a SIPO to a country doing nothing, we may overestimate the effect of a SIPO, because it is the sum of the signal and the SIPO. Instead, we should compare the country issuing the SIPO to a country “doing the least” to estimate the marginal effect of the SIPO. 

 To take an example, Bonardi et al. (2020) find relatively large effects of doing something but no effect of doing more. They find no extra effect of stricter lockdowns relative to less strict lockdowns and state that “our results point to the fact that people might adjust their behaviors quite significantly as partial measures are implemented, which might be enough to stop the spread of the virus.” Hence, whether the baseline is Sweden, which implemented a ban on large gatherings early in the pandemic, or the baseline is “doing nothing” can affect the magnitude of the estimated impacts. There is no obvious right way to resolve this issue, but since estimates in most studies are relative to doing less, we report results as compared to “doing less” when available. Hence, for Bonardi et al. we state that the effect of lockdowns is zero (compared to Sweden’s “doing the least”).

 3.2 Overview of the findings of eligible studies

 Table 1 covers the 34 studies eligible for our review.[24] Out of these 34 studies, 22 were peer- reviewed and 12 were working papers. The studies analyze lockdowns during the first wave. Most of the studies (29) use data collected before September 1[st], 2020 and 10 use data collected before May 1[st], 2020. Only one study uses data from 2021. All studies are cross-sectional, ranging across jurisdictions. Geographically, 14 studies cover countries worldwide, four cover European countries, 13 cover the United States, two cover Europe and the United States, and one covers regions in Italy. Seven studies analyze the effect of SIPOs, 10 analyze the effect of stricter lockdowns (measured by the OxCGRT stringency index), 16 studies analyze specific NIP’s independently, and one study analyzes other measures (length of lockdown).

 Several studies find no statistically significant effect of lockdowns on mortality. For example, this includes Bjørnskov (2021a) and Stockenhuber (2020) who find no significant effect of stricter lockdowns (higher OxCGRT stringency index), Sears et al. (2020) and Dave et al. (2021), who find no significant effect of SIPOs, and Chaudhry et al. (2020), Aparicio and Grossbard (2021) and Guo et al. (2021) who find no significant effect of any of the analyzed NIP’s, including business closures, school closures and border closures.

 Other studies find a significant negative relationship between lockdowns and mortality. Fowler et al. (2021 find that SIPOs reduce COVID-19 mortality by 35%, while Chernozhukov et al.

24 The following information can be found for each study in Table 2.

###### 14


-----

###### (2021) find that employee mask mandates reduces mortality by 34% and closing businesses and bars reduces mortality by 29%.

 Some studies find a significant positive relationship between lockdowns and mortality. This includes Chisadza et al. (2021), who find that stricter lockdowns (higher OxCGRT stringency index) increases COVID-19 mortality by 0.01 deaths/million per stringency point and Berry et al. (2021), who find that SIPOs increase COVID-19 mortality by 1% after 14 days.

 Most studies use the number of official COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. Only one study, Bjørnskov (2021a), looks at total excess mortality which – although is not perfect – we perceive to be the best measure, as it overcomes the measurement problems related to properly reporting COVID-19 deaths. 

 Several studies explicitly claim that they estimate the actual causal relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 mortality. Some studies use instrumental variables to justify the causality associated with their analysis, while others make causality probable using anecdotal evidence.[25] But, Sebhatu et al. (2020) show that government policies are strongly driven by the policies initiated in neighboring countries rather than by the severity of the pandemic in their own countries. In short, it is not the severity of the pandemic that drives the adoption of lockdowns, but rather the propensity to copy policies initiated by neighboring countries. The Sebhatu et al. conclusion throws into doubt the notion of a causal relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 mortality.

Use State-level data from the COVID-19
Tracking Project data all U.S. states, and a
multivariate regression analysis to
empirically investigate the impacts of the
duration of shelter-in-place orders on
mortality.

Their main focus is to explain the gap in
COVID-19-fatalities between Europe and
the United States based on COVID-deaths
and other data from 85 nations/states.
They include status for "social events"
(ban on public gatherings, cancellation of
major events and conferences), school
closures, shop closures "partial
lockdowns" (e.g. night curfew) and
"lockdowns" (all-day curfew) 100 days
after the pandemic onset in a

In the abstract the authors states that "various
types of social distance measures such as school

were implemented, help explain the
U.S./EUROPE gap in cumulative deaths

in a state or country" although their estimates
are insignificant.

following enactment of a SIPO. These findings are consistent with a causal interpretation.”

Their main focus is on the effectiveness of
policies targeted to diminish the effect of
socioeconomic inequalities (economic
support) on COVID-19-deaths. They use
data from 80 countries worldwide and
include the OxCGRT stringency as a
control variable in their models. The paper
finds a significant negative (fewer deaths)
effect of stricter lockdowns. The effect of
lockdowns is insignificant, when they
include an interaction term between the
socioeconomic conditions index and the
economic support index in their model.

For each 1-unit increase
in OxCGRT stringency
index, the cumulative
mortality changes by 0.326 deaths per million
(fewer deaths). The
estimate is -0.073

insignificant, when

State that they adjust

years and 65 years,
CDC's social

stay-at-home or
shelter-in-place order,

but does not specify
how and do not present
estimates.


All 50 states closed schools between March 13,
2020, and March 23, 2020. Hence, all
difference-in-difference is based on maximum
10 days, and given the long lag between
infection and death, there is a risk that their
approach is more an interrupted time series
analysis, where they compare United States
before and after school closures, rather than a
true difference-in-difference approach.
However, we choose to include the study in our
review as it - objectively speaking - lives up to
the eligibility criteria specified in our protocol.

COVID19
mortality


U.S. population-based observational study
which uses interrupted time series
analyses incorporating a lag period to
allow for potential policy-associated
changes to occur. To isolate the
association of school closure with
outcomes, state-level nonpharmaceutical
interventions and attributes were
included in negative binomial regression
models. Models were used to derive the
estimated absolute differences between
schools that closed and schools that
remained open. The main outcome of the
study is COVID-19 daily incidence and
mortality per 100000 residents.

The authors use U.S. county data on
COVID-19 deaths from Johns Hopkin and
SIPO data from the University of
Washington to estimate the effect of
SIPO's. They find no detectable effects of
SIPO on deaths. The authors stress that
their findings should not be interpreted as
evidence that social distancing behaviors
are not effective. Many people had
already changed their behaviors before
the introduction of shelter-in-place
orders, and shelter-in-place orders appear
to have been ineffective precisely because
they did not meaningfully alter social
distancing behavior.

Uses excess mortality and OxCGRT
stringency from 24 European countries to
estimate the effect of lockdown on the
number of deaths one, two, three and
four weeks later. Finds no effect (negative
but insignificant) of (stricter) lockdowns.

Only conclude on NPIs which reduce mortality.
However, the conclusion is based on one-tailed
tests, which means that all positive estimates

their mortality-specification (Table 3, Proportion

estimate of all school closures (.204) and
mandatory self-quarantine of travelers (0.363) is
deemed insignificant based on schools CI [.029,

believe, these results should be interpreted as a

COVID19
mortality


Uses cellular location data from all 50
states and the District of Columbia to
investigate mobility patterns during the
pandemic across states and time. Adding
COVID-19 death tolls and the timing of
SIPO for each state they estimate the
effect of stay-at-home policies on
COVID-19 mortality.


In the abstract the authors state that death
rates would be 42-54% lower than in the
absence of policies. However, this includes
averted deaths due to pre-mandate social
distancing behavior (p. 6). The effect of SIPO is
a reduction in deaths by 29%-35% compared to
a situation without SIPO but with pre-mandate
social distancing. These estimates are
insignificant at a 95% confidence interval.

A stricter lockdown (1

reduces deaths by 0,1%
after 4 weeks. After 8
weeks the effect is
insignificant.


Of the nine subcategories in the
OxCGRT stringency
index, only travel

(with level 2
"Quarantine arrivals
from high-risk regions"
having the largest
effect, and the strictest

Restrictions on very

(>1,000) has a large

(fewer deaths) effect,
while the effect of
stricter restrictions on

recommend that the
closing of schools (level

Finds that some
interventions (e.g. mask
mandates, restaurant
and bar closures, gym
closures, and high-risk
business closures)
reduces mortality
growth, while other
interventions (closures
of low- to medium-risk
businesses and personal
care/spa services) did
not have an effect and
may even have
increased the number
of deaths.


In total they analyze the lockdown effect of 21
variables. 14 of 21 estimates are significant, and
of these 6 are negative (reduces deaths) while 8
are positive (increases deaths). Some results are
far from intuitive. E.g. mask recommendations
increases deaths by 48% while mask mandates
reduces deaths by 12%, and closing restaurants
and bars reduces deaths by 50%, while closing
bars but not restaurants only reduces deaths by
5%.

COVID19
mortality


Uses COVID-19-deaths and OxCGRT
stringency from 169 countries to estimate
the effect of lockdown on the number of
deaths 1-8 weeks later. Finds that stricter
lockdowns reduce COVID-19-deaths 4
weeks later (but insignificant 8 weeks
later) and have the greatest effect in high
income countries. Finds no effect of
workplace closures in low-income
countries.

Use data for every county in the United
States from March through December
2020 to estimate the effect of various
NPIs on the COVID-19-deaths growth
rate. Derives causality by 1) assuming that
state regulators primarily focus on the
state’s most populous counties, so state
regulation in smaller counties can be
viewed as a quasi randomized experiment,
and 2) conducting county pair analysis,
where similar counties in different states
(and subject to different state policies) are
compared.

Uses data for the number of COVID‐19
infections and deaths and policy
information for 24 countries from
OxCGRT to estimate the effect of stricter
lockdowns on the number of deaths using
principal component analysis and a
generalized linear mixed model.

Uses daily Covid-19 deaths for 130
countries from the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
and daily policy data from the Oxford
COVID-19 Government Response Tracker
(OxCGRT). Looks at all levels of
restrictions for each of the nine subcategories of the OxCGRT stringency
index (school, work, events, gatherings,
transport, SIPO, internal movement,
travel).


Their results are counter intuitive and
somewhat inconclusive. Why does limiting very
large gatherings (>1,000) work, while stricter
limits do not? Why do recommending school
closures cause more deaths? Why is the effect
of border closures before 1st death insignificant,
while the effect of closing borders after 1st
death is significant (and large)? And why does
quarantining arrivals from high-risk regions work
better than total border closures? With 23
estimated parameters in total these counter
intuitive and inconclusive results could be
caused by multiple test bias (we correct for this
in the meta-analysis), but may also be caused by
other factors such as omitted variable bias.

(2020). This is the subject for our meta-analysis in the next section. Here, it turns out that -0.073 to -0.326 deaths/million per stringency point is a relatively modest effect and only corresponds to a 2.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality on average in the U.S. and Europe.

###### 4 Meta-analysis: The impact of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality

 We now turn to the meta-analysis, where we focus on the impact of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality.

 In the meta-analysis, we include 24 studies in which we can derive the relative effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality, where mortality is measured as COVID-19-related deaths per million. In practice, this means that the studies we included estimate the effect of lockdowns on mortality or the effect of lockdowns on mortality growth rates, while using a counterfactual estimate.[26]

 Our focus is on the effect of compulsory non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), policies that restrict internal movement, close schools and businesses, and ban international travel, among others. We do not look at the effect of voluntary behavioral changes (e.g. voluntary mask wearing), the effect of recommendations (e.g. recommended mask wearing), or governmental services (voluntary mass testing and public information campaigns), but only on mandated NPIs.

 The studies we examine are placed in three categories. Seven studies analyze the effect of stricter lockdowns based on the OxCGRT stringency indices, 13 studies analyze the effect of SIPOs (6 studies only analyze SIPOs, while seven analyze SIPOs among other interventions), and 11 studies analyze the effect of specific NPIs independently (lockdown vs. no lockdown).[27] Each of these categories is handled so that comparable estimates can be made across categories. Below, we present the results for each category and show the overall results, as well as those based on various quality dimensions.

 Quality dimensions  We include quality dimensions because there are reasons to believe that can affect a study’s conclusion. Below we describe the dimensions, as well as our reasons to believe that they are necessary to fully understand the empirical evidence.

 • Peer-reviewed vs. working papers: We distinguish between peer-reviewed studies and
 working papers as we consider peer-reviewed studies generally being of higher quality than working papers.[28]

 • Long vs. short time period: We distinguish between studies based on long time periods (with
 data series ending after May 31, 2020) and short time periods (data series ending at or before May 31, 2020), because the first wave did not fully end before late June in the U.S. and Europe. Thus, studies relying on short data periods lack the last part of the first wave and may yield biased results if lockdowns only “flatten the curve” and do not prevent deaths.

26 As a minimum requirement, one needs to know the effect on the top of the curve.
27 The total is larger than 21 because the 11 SIPO studies include seven studies which look at multiple measures.
28 Vetted papers from CEPR Covid Economics are considered as working papers in this regard.

###### 24


-----

###### • No early effect on mortality: On average, it takes approximately three weeks from infection
 to death.[29] However, several studies find effects of lockdown on mortality almost immediately. Fowler et al. (2021) find a significant effect of SIPOs on mortality after just four days and the largest effect after 10 days. An early effect may indicate that other factors (omitted variables) drive the results, and, thus, we distinguish between studies which find an effect on mortality sooner than 14 days after lockdown and those that do not.[30] Note that many studies do not look at the short term and thus fall into the latter category by default. 

 • Social sciences vs. other sciences: While it is true that epidemiologists and researchers in
 natural sciences should, in principle, know much more about COVID-19 and how it spreads than social scientists, social scientists are, in principle, experts in evaluating the effect of various policy interventions. Thus, we distinguish between studies published by scholars in social sciences and by scholars from other fields of research. We perceive the former as being better suited for examining the effects of lockdowns on mortality. For each study, we have registered the research field for the corresponding author’s associated institute (e.g., for a scholar from “Institute of economics” research field is registered as “Economics”). Where no corresponding author was available, the first author has been used. Afterwards, all research fields have been classified as either from the “Social Science” or “Other.””[31]

 We also considered including a quality dimension to distinguish between studies based on excess mortality and studies based on COVID-19 mortality, as we believe that excess mortality is potentially a better measure for two reasons. First, data on total deaths in a country is far more precise than data on COVID-19 related deaths, which may be both underreported (due to lack of tests) or overreported (because some people die with – but not because of – COVID-19). Secondly, a major purpose of lockdowns is to save lives. To the extend lockdowns shift deaths from COVID-19 to other causes (e.g. suicide), estimates based on COVID-19 mortality will overestimate the effect of lockdowns. Likewise, if lockdowns save lives in other ways (e.g. fewer traffic accidents) lockdowns’ effect on mortality will be underestimated. However, as only one

29 Leffler et al. (2020) writes, “On average, the time from infection with the coronavirus to onset of symptoms is 5.1

days, and the time from symptom onset to death is on average 17.8 days. Therefore, the time from infection to
death is expected to be 23 days.” Meanwhile, Stokes et al. (2020) writes that “evidence suggests a mean lag
between virus transmission and symptom onset of 6 days, and a further mean lag of 18 days between onset of
symptoms and death.”

30 Some of the authors are aware of this problem. E.g. Bjørnskov (2021a) writes ”when the lag length extends to

three or fourth weeks, that is, the length that is reasonable from the perspective of the virology of Sars-CoV-2, the
estimates become very small and insignificant” and ”these results confirm the overall pattern by being negative
and significant when lagged one or two weeks (the period when they cannot have worked) but turning positive and
insignificant when lagged four weeks.”

31 Research fields classified as social sciences were economics, public health, management, political science,

government, international development, and public policy, while research fields not classified as social sciences
were ophthalmology, environment, medicine, evolutionary biology and environment, human toxicology,
epidemiology, and anesthesiology.

###### Interpreting and weighting estimates The estimates used in the meta-analysis are not always readily available in the studies shown in Table 2. In Appendix B Table 9, we describe for each paper how we interpret the estimates and how they are converted to a common estimate (the relative effect of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality) which is comparable across all studies.

 Following Paldam (2015) and Stanley and Doucouliagos (2010), we also convert standard errors[32] and use the precision of each estimate (defined as 1/SE) to calculate the precision- weighted average of all estimates and present funnel plots. The precision-weighted average is our primary indicator of the efficacy of lockdowns, but we also report arithmetic averages and medians in the meta-analysis.

 In the following sections, we present the meta-analysis for each of the three groups of studies (stringency index-studies, SIPO-studies, and studies analyzing specific NPIs).

 4.1 Stringency index studies

 Seven eligible studies examine the link between lockdown stringency and COVID-19 mortality. The results from these studies, converted to common estimates, are presented in Table 3 below. All studies are based on the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker’s (OxCGRT) stringency index of Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government (Hale et al. (2020)). 

 The OxCGRT stringency index neither measures the expected effectiveness of the lockdowns nor the expected costs. Instead, it describes the stringency based on nine equally weighted parameters.[33] Many countries followed similar patterns and almost all countries closed schools,

32 Standard errors are converted such that the t-value, calculated based on common estimates and standard errors, is

unchanged. When confidence intervals are reported rather than standard errors, we calculate standard errors using
t-distribution with ∞ degrees of freedom (i.e. 1.96 for 95% confidence interval).

33 The nine parameters are "C1 School closing,” "C2 Workplace closing,” "C3 Cancel public events,” "C4

Restrictions on gatherings,” "C5 Close public transport,” "C6 Stay at home requirements,” "C7 Restrictions on
internal movement,” "C8 International travel controls" and "H1 Public information campaigns.” The latter, "H1

###### 28

###### while only a few countries issued SIPOs without closing businesses. Hence, it is reasonable to perceive the stringency index as continuous, although not necessarily linear. The index includes recommendations (e.g. “workplace closing” is 1 if the government recommends closing (or work from home), cf. Hale et al. (2021)), but the effect of including recommendations in the index is primarily to shift the index parallelly upward and should not alter the results relative to our focus on mandated NPIs. It is important to note that the index is not perfect. As pointed out by Book (2020), it is certainly possibly to identify errors and omissions in the index. However, the index is objective and unbiased and as such, useful for cross-sectional analysis with several observations, even if not suitable for comparing the overall strictness of lockdowns in two countries. 

 Since the studies examined use different units of estimates, we have created common estimates for Europe and United States to make them comparable. The common estimates show the effect of the average lockdown in Europe and United States (with average stringencies of 76 and 74, respectively, between March 16[th] and April 15[th], 2020, compared to a policy based solely on recommendations (stringency 44)). For example, Ashraf (2020) estimates that the effect of stricter lockdowns is -0.073 to -0.326 deaths/million per stringency point. We use the average of these two estimates (-0.200) in the meta-analysis (see Table 9 in Appendix B for a description for all studies). The average lockdown in Europe between March 16[th] and April 15[th], 2020, was 32 points stricter than a policy solely based on recommendations (76 vs. 44). In United States, it was 30 points. Hence, the total effect of the lockdowns compared to the recommendation policy was -6.37 deaths/million in Europe (32 x -0.200) and -5.91 deaths/million in United States. With populations of 748 million and 333 million, respectively the total effect as estimated by Ashraf (2020) is 4,766 averted COVID-19 deaths in Europe and 1,969 averted COVID-19 deaths in United States. By the end of the study period in Ashraf (2020), which is May 20, 2020, 164,600 people in Europe and 97,081 people in the United States had died of COVID-19. Hence, the 4,766 averted COVID-19 deaths in Europe and the 1,969 averted COVID-19 deaths in the United States corresponds to 2.8% and 2.0% of all COVID-19 deaths, respectively, with an arithmetic average of 2.4%. Our common estimate is thus -2.4%, cf. Table 3. So, this means that Ashraf (2020) estimates that without lockdowns, COVID-19 deaths in Europe would have been 169,366 and COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. would have been 99,050. Our approach is not unproblematic. First of all, the level of stringency varies over time for all countries. We use the stringency between March 16[th] and April 15[th], 2020 because this period covers the main part of the first wave which most of the studies analyze. Secondly, OxCGRT has changed the index over time and a 10-point difference today may not be exactly the same as a 10-point difference when the studies were finalized. However, we believe these problems are unlikely to significantly alter our results.

Public information campaigns,” is not an intervention following our definition, as it is not a mandatory
requirement. However, of 97 European countries and U.S. States in the OxCGRT database, only Andorra, Belarus,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Faeroe Islands, and Moldova – less than 1.6% of the population – did not get the
maximum score by March 20, 2020, so the parameter simply shifts the index parallelly upward and should not
have notable impact on the analyzes.

###### Table 3 demonstrates that the studies find that lockdowns, on average, have reduced COVID-19 mortality rates by 0.2% (precision-weighted). The results yield a median of -2.4% and an arithmetic average of -7.3%. Only one of the seven studies, Fuller et al. (2021), finds a significant and (relative to the effect predicted in studies like Ferguson et al. (2020)) substantial effect of lockdowns (-35%). The other six studies find much smaller effects. Hence, based on the stringency index studies, we find little to no evidence that mandated lockdowns in Europe and the United States had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality rates. And, as will be discussed in the next paragraph, the fifth column of Table 3 displays the number of quality dimensions (out of 4) met by each study.

###### We now turn to the quality dimensions. Table 4 presents the results differentiated by the four quality dimensions. Two studies, Shiva and Molana (2021) and Chisadza et al. (2021), meet all quality dimensions. The precision-weighted average for these studies is 0.0%, meaning that lockdowns had no effect on COVID-19 mortality. Two studies live up to 3 of 4 quality dimensions (Bjørnskov (2021a) and Stockenhuber (2020)). The precision-weighted average for these studies is -0.3%, meaning that lockdowns reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.3%. Three studies lack at least two quality dimensions.[34] These studies find that lockdowns reduce COVID- 19 mortality by 4.2%. To sum up, we find that the studies that meet at least 3 of 4 quality measures find that lockdowns have little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality, while studies that

two quality parameters.

###### Overall conclusion on stringency index studies Compared to a policy based solely on recommendations, we find little evidence that lockdowns had a noticeable impact on COVID-19 mortality Only one study, Fuller et al. (2021), finds a substantial effect, while the rest of the studies find little to no effect. Indeed, according to stringency index studies, lockdowns in Europe and the United States reduced only COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% on average.

 In the following section we will look at the effect of SIPOs. The section follows the same structure as this section.

 4.2 Shelter-in-place order (SIPO) studies

 We have identified 13 eligible studies which estimate the effect of Shelter-In-Place Orders (SIPOs) on COVID-19 mortality, cf. Table 5. Seven of these studies look at multiple NPIs of which a SIPO is just one, while six studies estimate the effect of a SIPO vs. no SIPO in the United States. According to the containment and closure policy indicators from OxCGRT, 41 states in the U.S. issued SIPOs in the spring of 2020. But usually, these were introduced after implementing other NPIs such as school closures or workplace closures. On average, SIPOs

 32


-----

###### were issued 7½ days after both schools and workplaces closed, and 12 days after the first of the two closed. Only one state, Tennessee, issued a SIPO before schools and workplaces closed. The 10 states that did not issue SIPOs all closed schools. Moreover, of those 10 states, three closed some non-essential businesses, while the remaining 7 closed all non-essential businesses. Because of this, we perceive estimates for SIPOs based on U.S.-data as the marginal effect of SIPOs on top of other restrictions, although we acknowledge that the estimates may capture the effects of other NPI measures as well.

 The results of eligible studies based on SIPOs are presented in Table 5. The table demonstrates that the studies generally find that SIPOs have reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.9% (on a precision-weighted average). There is an apparent difference between studies in which a SIPO is one of multiple NPIs, and studies in which a SIPO is the only examined intervention. The former group generally finds that SIPOs increase COVID-19 mortality marginally, whereas the latter finds that SIPOs decrease COVID-19 mortality. As we will see below, this difference could be explained by differences in the quality dimensions, and especially the time period covered by each study.

###### meet all quality dimensions but find vastly different effects of SIPOs on COVID-19 mortality. The precision weighted average of the four studies is -1.0%. Four studies meet 3 of 4 quality dimensions. They overall find that SIPOs increase COVID-19 mortality, as the precision- weighted average is positive (3.7%). The five studies that meet 2 of 4 quality dimensions or fewer[37] find a substantial reduction in COVID-19-mortality (-34.2%). This substantial reduction seems to be driven by relatively short data series. The latest data point for the three studies which find large effects of lockdowns (Sears et al. (2020), Fowler et al. (2021), and Dave et al. (2021)) are April 29, May 7, and April 20, respectively. This may indicate that SIPOs can delay deaths but not eliminate them completely. Disregarding these studies with short data series, the precision-weighted average is -0.1%.

###### Overall conclusion on SIPO studies We find no clear evidence that SIPOs had a noticeable impact on COVID-19 mortality. Some studies find a large negative relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 mortality, but this seems to be caused by short data series which does not cover a full COVID-19 ‘wave’. Several studies find a small positive relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 mortality. Although this appears to be counterintuitive, it could be the result of an (asymptomatic) infected person being isolated at home under a SIPO can infect family members with a higher viral load causing more severe illness.[39] The overall effect measured by the precision-weighted average is -2.9%. The result is in line with Nuzzo et al. (2019), who state that “In the context of a high-impact

38 This could indicate some publication bias, but the evidence is weak and with only 13 estimates, this cannot be

formally tested

39 E.g. see Guallar et al. (2020), who concludes, “Our data support that a greater viral inoculum at the time of SARS
CoV-2 exposure might determine a higher risk of severe COVID-19.”

###### 35

###### respiratory pathogen, quarantine may be the least likely NPI to be effective in controlling the spread due to high transmissibility” and World Health Organization Writing Group (2006), who conclude that “forced isolation and quarantine are ineffective and impractical.”[40]

 In the following section, we will look at the effect found in studies analyzing specific NPIs.

 4.3 Studies of specific NPIs

 A total of 11 eligible studies look at (multiple) specific NPIs independently or simply lockdown vs. no lockdown.[41] The definition of the specific NPIs varies from study to study and are somewhat difficult to compare. The variety in the definitions can be seen in the analysis of non- essential business closures and bar/restaurant closures. Chernozhukov et al. (2021) focus on a combined parameter (the average of business closure and bar/restaurant closure in each state), Aparicio and Grossbard (2021) look at business closure but not bar/restaurant closure, Spiegel and Tookes (2021) examine bar/restaurant closure but not business closure, and Guo et al. (2021) look at both business closures and bar/restaurant closures independently. 

 Some studies include several NPIs (e.g. Stokes et al. (2020) and Spiegel and Tookes (2021)), while others cover very few. Bongaerts et al. (2021) only study business closures, and Leffler et al. (2020) look at internal lockdown and international travel restrictions). Few NPIs in a model are potentially a problem because they can capture the effect of excluded NPIs. On the other hand, several NPIs in a model increase the risk of multiple test bias.

 The differences in the choice of NPIs and in the number of NPIs make it challenging to create an overview of the results. In Table 7, we have merged the results in six overall categories but note that the estimates may not be fully comparable across studies. In particular, the lockdown- measure varies from study to study and in some cases is poorly defined by the authors. Also, there are only a few estimates within some of the categories. For instance, the estimate of the effect of facemasks is based on only two studies.

 Table 7 illustrates that generally there is no evidence of a noticeable relationship between the most-used NPIs and COVID-19. Overall, lockdowns and limiting gatherings seem to increase COVID-19 mortality, although the effect is modest (0.6% and 1.6%, respectively) and border closures has little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality, with a precision-weighted average of - 0.1% (removing the imprecise outlier from Guo et al. (2021) changes the precision-weighted average to -0.2%). We find a small effect of school closure (-4.4%), but this estimate is mainly driven by Auger et al. (2020), who – as noted earlier – use an “interrupted time series study”

40 Both Nuzzo et al. (2019) and World Health Organization Writing Group (2006) focus on quarantining infected

persons. However, if quarantining infected persons is not effective, it should be no surprise that quarantining
uninfected persons could be ineffective too.

41 Note that we – according to our search strategy – did not search on specific measures such as “school closures”

but on words describing the overall political approach to the COVID-19 pandemic such as “non-pharmaceutical,”
“NPIs,” ”lockdown” etc.

###### 36

###### approach and may capture other effects such as seasonal and behavioral effects. The absence of a notable effect of school closures is in line with Irfan et al. (2021), who – based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of 90 published or preprint studies of transmission in children – concluded that “risks of infection among children in educational-settings was lower than in communities. Evidence from school-based studies demonstrate it is largely safe for young children (<10 years of age ) to be at schools; however, older children (between 10 and 19 years of age) might facilitate transmission.” UNICEF (2021) and ECDC (2020) reach similar conclusions.[42]

 Mandating facemasks – an intervention that was not widely used in the spring of 2020, and in many countries was even discouraged – seems to have a large effect (-21.2%), but this conclusion is based on only two studies.[43] Again, our categorization may play a role, as the larger mask-estimate from Chernozhukov et al. (2021) is in fact “employee facemasks,” not a general mask mandate. Our findings are somewhat in contrast to the result found in a review by Liu et al. (2021), who conclude that “fourteen of sixteen identified randomized controlled trials comparing face masks to no mask controls failed to find statistically significant benefit in the intent-to-treat populations.” Similarly, a pre-COVID Cochrane review concludes, “There is low certainty evidence from nine trials (3507 participants) that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI) compared to not wearing a mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.18). There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory‐ confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants)” (Jefferson et al. (2020)).[44] However, it should be noted that even if no effect is found in controlled settings, this does not necessarily imply that mandated face masks does not reduce mortality, as other factors may play a role (e.g. wearing a mask may function as a tax on socializing if people are bothered by wearing a face masks when they are socializing).

42 UNICEF (2021) concludes, “The preliminary findings thus far suggest that in-person schooling – especially when

coupled with preventive and control measures – had lower secondary COVID-19 transmission rates compared to
other settings and do not seem to have significantly contributed to the overall community transmission risks.”
Whereas, ECDC (2020) conclude, “School closures can contribute to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission,
but by themselves are insufficient to prevent community transmission of COVID-19 in the absence of other
nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as restrictions on mass gathering,” and states, “There is a general
consensus that the decision to close schools to control the COVID-19 pandemic should be used as a last resort.
The negative physical, mental health and educational impact of proactive school closures on children, as well as
the economic impact on society more broadly, would likely outweigh the benefits.”

43 Note again, that we – according to our search strategy – did not search on the specific measures such as “masks,”

“face masks,” “surgical masks” but on words describing the overall political approach to the COVID-19 pandemic
such as “non-pharmaceutical,” “NPIs,” ”lockdown” etc. Thus, we do not include most of the studies in mask
reviews such as Liu et al. (2021) and Jefferson et al. (2020).

44 Lipp and Edwards (2014) also find no evidence of an effect and – looking at disposable surgical face masks for

preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery – conclude, “Three trials were included, involving a total of
2113 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the masked and
unmasked group in any of the trials.” Meanwhile, Li et al. (2021) – based on six case-control studies – conclude,
“In general, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.38,
95% CI: 0.21-0.69, I[2] = 54.1%).

###### 37


-----

###### Only business closure consistently shows evidence of a negative relationship with COVID-19 mortality, but the variation in the estimated effect is large. Three studies find little to no effect, and three find large effects. Two of the larger effects are related to closing bars and restaurants. The “close business” category in Chernozhukov et al. (2021) is an average of closed businesses, restaurants, and movie theaters, while that same category is “closing restaurants and bars” in Spiegel and Tookes (2021). The last study finding a large effect is Bongaerts et al. (2021), the only eligible single-country study.[45]

 As a final observation on Table 7, studies with fewer quality dimensions seem to find larger effects, but the pattern is not systematic.[46]

_Note: [* ]It is not possible to derive common estimates and standard errors from Chaudhry et al. (2020) and Bonardi et al. (2020). Chaudhry_
_et al. (2020) states that the effect of the various NPIs is insignificant without listing the estimates and standard errors. Bonardi et al._
_(2020) states that partial or regional lockdowns are as effective as stricter NPIs but does not provide information to calculate common_
_estimates. Instead, we assume the estimate is 0% when calculating arithmetic average and median, while the estimates are excluded from_

45 Bongaerts et al. (2021) (implicitly) assume that municipalities with different exposures to closed sectors are not

inherently different, which may be a relatively strong assumption and could potentially drive their results.

46 We saw with SIPOs that studies based on short data series tended to find larger effects than studies based on short

data series. This is also somewhat true for studies examining multiple specific measures. If we focus on studies
with long data series (>May 31[st], 2020), the precision-weighted estimates are as follows (average for all studies in
parentheses for easy comparison): Lockdown (complete/partial): 0.5% (0.6%), Facemasks/Employee face masks: 21.2% (-21.2%), Business closures (/bars & restaurants): -8.1% (-10.6%), Border closures (/quarantine): -0.1% (0.1%), School closures: 0.5% (-4.4%), Limiting gatherings: 1.4% (1.6%).

Two estimates from Toya and Skidmore (2020) stands out with a precision far higher than those of other studies, and estimates are placed with some ‘tail’ to the left, which could indicate some publication bias, i.e. reluctance to publish results that show large positive (more deaths) effects of lockdowns. The most precise estimates are gathered around 0%, while less precise studies are spread out between -58% and 36%. The precision-weighted average of all estimates across all NPIs is -0.6%.

###### Overall conclusion on specific NPIs Because of the heterogeneity in NPIs across studies, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions based on the studies of multiple specific measures. We find no evidence that lockdowns, school closures, border closures, and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID-19 mortality. There is some evidence that business closures reduce COVID-19 mortality, but the variation in estimates is large and the effect seems related to closing bars. There may be an effect of mask mandates, but just two studies look at this, one of which one only looks at the effect of employee mask mandates.

###### 5 Concluding observations

 Public health experts and politicians have – based on forecasts in epidemiological studies such as that of Imperial College London (Ferguson et al. (2020) – embraced compulsory lockdowns as an effective method for arresting the pandemic. But, have these lockdown policies been effective in curbing COVID-19 mortality? This is the main question answered by our meta-analysis.

 Adopting a systematic search and title-based screening, we identified 1,048 studies published by July 1[st], 2020, which potentially look at the effect of lockdowns on mortality rates. To answer our question, we focused on studies that examine the actual impact of lockdowns on COVID-19 mortality rates based on registered cross-sectional mortality data and a counterfactual difference- in-difference approach. Out of the 1,048 studies, 34 met our eligibility criteria.

 Conclusions Overall, our meta-analysis fails to confirm that lockdowns have had a large, significant effect on mortality rates. Studies examining the relationship between lockdown strictness (based on the OxCGRT stringency index) find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% compared to a COVID-19 policy based solely on recommendations. Shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) were also ineffective. They only reduced COVID-19 mortality by 2.9%.

 Studies looking at specific NPIs (lockdown vs. no lockdown, facemasks, closing non-essential businesses, border closures, school closures, and limiting gatherings) also find no broad-based evidence of noticeable effects on COVID-19 mortality. However, closing non-essential businesses seems to have had some effect (reducing COVID-19 mortality by 10.6%), which is likely to be related to the closure of bars. Also, masks may reduce COVID-19 mortality, but there is only one study that examines universal mask mandates. The effect of border closures, school closures and limiting gatherings on COVID-19 mortality yields precision-weighted estimates of -0.1%, -4.4%, and 1.6%, respectively. Lockdowns (compared to no lockdowns) also do not reduce COVID-19 mortality.

 Discussion Overall, we conclude that lockdowns are not an effective way of reducing mortality rates during a pandemic, at least not during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are in line with the World Health Organization Writing Group (2006), who state, “Reports from the 1918 influenza pandemic indicate that social-distancing measures did not stop or appear to dramatically reduce transmission […] In Edmonton, Canada, isolation and quarantine were instituted; public meetings were banned; schools, churches, colleges, theaters, and other public gathering places were closed; and business hours were restricted without obvious impact on the epidemic.” Our findings are also in line with Allen's (2021) conclusion: “The most recent research has shown that lockdowns have had, at best, a marginal effect on the number of Covid- 19 deaths.” Poeschl and Larsen (2021) conclude that “interventions are generally effective in

###### mitigating COVID-19 spread”. But, 9 of the 43 (21%) results they review find “no or uncertain association” between lockdowns and the spread of COVID-19, suggesting that evidence from that own study contradicts their conclusion.

 The findings contained in Johanna et al. (2020) are in contrast to our own. They conclude that “for lockdown, ten studies consistently showed that it successfully reduced the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality rate of COVID-19.” The driver of the difference is three- fold. First, Johanna et al. include modelling studies (10 out of a total of 14 studies), which we have explicitly excluded. Second, they included interrupted time series studies (3 of 14 studies), which we also exclude. Third, the only study using a difference-in-difference approach (as we have done) is based on data collected before May 1[st], 2020. We should mention that our results indicate that early studies find relatively larger effects compared to later studies.

 Our main conclusion invites a discussion of some issues. Our review does not point out why lockdowns did not have the effect promised by the epidemiological models of Imperial College London (Ferguson et al. (2020). We propose four factors that might explain the difference between our conclusion and the view embraced by some epidemiologists.

 First, people respond to dangers outside their door. When a pandemic rages, people believe in social distancing regardless of what the government mandates. So, we believe that Allen (2021) is right, when he concludes, “The ineffectiveness [of lockdowns] stemmed from individual changes in behavior: either non-compliance or behavior that mimicked lockdowns.” In economic terms, you can say that the demand for costly disease prevention efforts like social distancing and increased focus on hygiene is high when infection rates are high. Contrary, when infection rates are low, the demand is low and it may even be morally and economically rational not to comply with mandates like SIPOs, which are difficult to enforce. Herby (2021) reviews studies which distinguish between mandatory and voluntary behavioral changes. He finds that – on average – voluntary behavioral changes are 10 times as important as mandatory behavioral changes in combating COVID-19. If people voluntarily adjust their behavior to the risk of the pandemic, closing down non-essential businesses may simply reallocate consumer visits away from “nonessential” to “essential” businesses, as shown by Goolsbee and Syverson (2021), with limited impact on the total number of contacts.[47] This may also explain why epidemiological model simulations such as Ferguson et al. (2020) – which do not model behavior endogenously – fail to forecast the effect of lockdowns.

 Second, mandates only regulate a fraction of our potential contagious contacts and can hardly regulate nor enforce handwashing, coughing etiquette, distancing in supermarkets, etc. Countries like Denmark, Finland, and Norway that realized success in keeping COVID-19 mortality rates relatively low allowed people to go to work, use public transport, and meet privately at home during the first lockdown. In these countries, there were ample opportunities to legally meet with others.

47 In economic terms, lockdowns are substitutes for – not complements to – voluntary behavioral changes.

###### 41

###### Third, even if lockdowns are successful in initially reducing the spread of COVID-19, the behavioral response may counteract the effect completely, as people respond to the lower risk by changing behavior. As Atkeson (2021) points out, the economic intuition is straightforward. If closing bars and restaurants causes the prevalence of the disease to fall toward zero, the demand for costly disease prevention efforts like social distancing and increased focus on hygiene also falls towards zero, and the disease will return.[48]

 Fourth, unintended consequences may play a larger role than recognized. We already pointed to the possible unintended consequence of SIPOs, which may isolate an infected person at home with his/her family where he/she risks infecting family members with a higher viral load, causing more severe illness. But often, lockdowns have limited peoples’ access to safe (outdoor) places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe (indoor) places. Indeed, we do find some evidence that limiting gatherings was counterproductive and increased COVID-19 mortality.

 One objection to our conclusions may be that we do not look at the role of timing. If timing is very important, differences in timing may empirically overrule any differences in lockdowns. We note that this objection is not necessarily in contrast to our results. If timing is very important relative to strictness, this suggests that well-timed, but very mild, lockdowns should work as well as, or better than, less well-timed but strict lockdowns. This is not in contrast to our conclusion, as the studies we reviewed analyze the effect of lockdowns compared but to doing very little (see Section 3.1 for further discussion). However, there is little solid evidence supporting the timing thesis, because it is inherently difficult to analyze (see Section 2.2 for further discussion). Also, even if it can be empirically stated that a well-timed lockdown is effective in combating a pandemic, it is doubtful that this information will ever be useful from a policy perspective. 

 But, what explains the differences between countries, if not differences in lockdown policies? Differences in population age and health, quality of the health sector, and the like are obvious factors. But several studies point at less obvious factors, such as culture, communication, and coincidences. For example, Frey et al. (2020) show that for the same policy stringency, countries with more obedient and collectivist cultural traits experienced larger declines in geographic mobility relative to their more individualistic counterpart. Data from Germany Laliotis and Minos (2020) shows that the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting deaths in predominantly Catholic regions with stronger social and family ties were much higher compared to non- Catholic ones at the local NUTS 3 level.[49]

 Government communication may also have played a large role. Compared to its Scandinavian neighbors, the communication from Swedish health authorities was far more subdued and embraced the idea of public health vs. economic trade-offs. This may explain why Helsingen et

48 This kind of behavior response may also explain why Subramanian and Kumar (2021) find that increases in

COVID-19 cases are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States.
When people are vaccinated and protected against severe disease, they have less reason to be careful.

49 The NUTS classification (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a hierarchical system for dividing up

the economic territory of the EU and the UK. There are 1215 regions at the NUTS 3-level.

###### al. (2020), found, based on questionnaire data collected from mid-March to mid-April, 2020, that even though the daily COVID-19 mortality rate was more than four times higher in Sweden than in Norway, Swedes were less likely than Norwegians to not meet with friends (55% vs. 87%), avoid public transportation (72% vs. 82%), and stay home during spare time (71% vs. 87%). That is, despite a more severe pandemic, Swedes were less affected in their daily activities (legal in both countries) than Norwegians. 

 Many other factors may be relevant, and we should not underestimate the importance of coincidences. An interesting example illustrating this point is found in Arnarson (2021) and Björk et al. (2021), who show that areas where the winter holiday was relatively late (in week 9 or 10 rather than week 6, 7 or 8) were hit especially hard by COVID-19 during the first wave because the virus outbreak in the Alps could spread to those areas with ski tourists. Arnarson (2021) shows that the effect persists in later waves. Had the winter holiday in Sweden been in week 7 or week 8 as in Denmark, the Swedish COVID-19 situation could have turned out very differently.[50]

 Policy implications In the early stages of a pandemic, before the arrival of vaccines and new treatments, a society can respond in two ways: mandated behavioral changes or voluntary behavioral changes. Our study fails to demonstrate significant positive effects of mandated behavioral changes (lockdowns). This should draw our focus to the role of voluntary behavioral changes. Here, more research is needed to determine how voluntary behavioral changes can be supported. But it should be clear that one important role for government authorities is to provide information so that citizens can voluntarily respond to the pandemic in a way that mitigates their exposure.

 Finally, allow us to broaden our perspective after presenting our meta-analysis that focuses on the following question: “What does the evidence tell us about the effects of lockdowns on mortality?” We provide a firm answer to this question: The evidence fails to confirm that lockdowns have a significant effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality. The effect is little to none.

 The use of lockdowns is a unique feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns have not been used to such a large extent during any of the pandemics of the past century. However, lockdowns during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic have had devastating effects. They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence, and undermining liberal democracy. These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best. Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument. 

50 Another case of coincidence is illustrated by Shenoy et al. (2022), who find that areas that experienced rainfall

early in the pandemic realized fewer deaths because the rainfall induced social distancing.

###### 6 Appendix A. The role of timing

 Some of the included papers study the importance of the timing of lockdowns, while several other papers only looking at timing of (but not on the inherent effect of) lockdowns have been excluded from the literature list in this review. There’s no doubt that being prepared for a pandemic and knowing when it arrives at your doorstep is vital. However, two problems arise with respect to imposing early lockdowns. 

 First of all, it was virtually impossible to determine the right timing when COVID-19 hit Europe and the United States. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a pandemic on 11 March 2020, but at that date Italy had already registered 13.7 COVID-19-deaths per million (all infected before approximately 22 February, because of the roughly 18 day gap between infection and death, c.f. e.g.. Bjørnskov (2021a)). On 29 March 2020, 18 days after WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic and the earliest a lockdown response to WHO’s announcement could have an effect, the death toll in Italy was a staggering 178 COVID-19-deaths per million with an additionally 13 per million dying each day. 

 There are reasons to believe that many countries and regions were hit particularly hard during the first wave of COVID, because they had no clue about how bad it really was. This point is illustrated in Figure 8 (and Figure 9), which show that countries (and states), which were hit hard and early, experienced large death tolls compared to countries where the pandemic had a slower start. Björk et al. (2021) and Arnarson (2021) show that areas with a winter holiday in week 10 and – especially – week 9 were hit hard, because they imported cases from the Alps before they knew the pandemic was wide spread at the ski resorts. Hence, while acting early by warning citizens and closing business may be an effective strategy; this was not a feasible strategy for most countries in the spring of 2020.

 The second problem is that it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the effect of public awareness and the effect of lockdowns. If people and politicians react to the same information, for example deaths in geographical neighboring countries (many EU-countries reacted to deaths in Italy) or in another part of the same country, the effect of lockdowns cannot easily be separated from the effect of voluntary social distancing or, use of hand sanitizers. Hence, we find it problematic to use national lockdowns and differences in the progress of the pandemic in different regions to say anything about the effect of early lockdowns on the pandemic, as the estimated effect might just as well come from voluntary behavior changes, when people in Southern Italy react to the situation in Northern Italy. 

 We have seen no studies which we believe credibly separate the effect of early lockdown from the effect of early voluntary behavior changes. Instead, the estimates in these studies capture the effects of lockdowns and voluntary behavior changes. As Herby (2021) illustrates, voluntary behavior changes are essential to a society’s response to an pandemic and can account for up to 90% of societies’ total response to the pandemic. 

 Including these studies will greatly overestimate the effect of lockdowns, and, hence, we chose not to include studies focusing on timing of lockdowns in our review.

###### 7.2 Interpretation of estimates and conversion to common estimates


Not effect of lockdowns


###### In Table 9, we describe for each study used in the meta-analysis how we interpret their results and convert the estimates to our common estimate. Standard errors are converted such that the t- value, calculated based on common estimates and standard errors, is unchanged. When confidence intervals are reported rather than standard errors, we calculate standard errors using t- distribution with ∞ degrees of freedom (i.e. 1.96 for 95% confidence interval).

We use estimates from Table 3, model 5. For each estimate the common estimate is calculated as
(difference in COVID-19 mortality with NPI)/(difference in COVID-19 mortality without NPI)-1,
where (difference in COVID-19 mortality with NPI) is 237.89 (Table 2 states that deaths per million is
406.99 in U.S. and 169.10 in Europe) and (difference in COVID-19 mortality without NPI) is estimated
as exp(ln(difference in COVID-19 mortality with NPI)-estimate).

It is unclear whether they prefer the model with or without the interaction term. In the meta-analysis,
we use an average of -0.326 (Table 3, without) and -0.073 (Table 6, with) deaths per million per
stringency point (i.e. -0.200). The common estimate is the average effect in Europe and United States
respectively calculated as (Actual COVID-19 mortality) / (COVID-19 mortality with recommendation
policy) -1, where (COVID-19 mortality with recommendation policy) is calculated as ((Actual COVID19 mortality) - Estimate x Difference in stringency x population). Stringencies in Europe and United
States are equal to the average stringency from March 16th to April 15th 2020 (76 and 74
respectively) and the stringency for the policy based solely on recommendations is 44 following Hale
et al. (2020).

"Association between
statewide school closure and
COVID-19 incidence and
mortality in the U.S."


1-Sep-20 JAMA Estimate that school closure was associated with a 58% decline in COVID-19 mortality and that the
effect was largest in states with low cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the time of school closure.
States with the lowest incidence of COVID-19 had a −72% relative change in incidence compared
with −49% for those states with the highest cumulative incidence.

24-Feb-21 PNAS The estimated effect of SIPO's, an increase in deaths by 0,654 per million after 14 days (significant, cf.
Fig. 2), is converted to a relative effect on a state basis based on data from OurWorldInData. For
states which did implement SIPO, we calculate the number of deaths without SIPO as the number of
official COVID-19 deaths 14 days after SIPO was implemented minus 0,654 extra deaths per million.
For states which did not implement SIPO, we calculate the number of deaths with SIPO as the
number of official COVID-19 deaths 14 days after March 31 2020 plus 0,654 extra deaths per million.
We use March 31 2020 as this was the average date on which SIPO was implemented in the 40 states
which did implement SIPO. Using this approximation, the effect of SIPO's in the U.S. is 1,1% more
deaths after 14 days. Common standard errors are not available.

The study is not included in the meta-analysis, as it looks at the effect of NPIs on growth rates and
does not include an estimate of the effect on total mortality.


8-Jun-20 0 Find that, world-wide, internal NPIs have prevented about 650,000 deaths (3.11 deaths were
prevented for each death that occurred, i.e. 76% effect). However, this effect is for any lockdown
including a Swedish lockdown. They do not find an extra effect of stricter lockdowns and state that
“our results point to the fact that people might adjust their behaviors quite significantly as partial
measures are implemented, which might be enough to stop the spread of the virus.” Hence, whether
the baseline is Sweden, which implemented a ban on large gatherings early in the pandemic, or the
baseline is “doing nothing” can affect the magnitude of the estimated impacts. Since all Western
countries did something and estimates in other reviewed studies are relative to doing less – and,
hence not to doing nothing, we report the result from Bonardi et al. as compared to “doing less.”
Hence, for Bonardi et al. we use 0% as the common estimate in the meta-analysis for each NPI (SIPO,
regional lockdown, partial lockdown, and border closure (stage 1, stage 2 and full) because all NPIs are
insignificant (compared to Sweden’s “doing the least”-lockdown).

PLOS ONE Business shutdown saved 9,439 Italian lives by 13th 2020. This corresponds to 32%, as there were
20,465 COVID-19-deaths in Italy by mid April 2020.


Finds no effect of partial border closure, complete border closure, partial lockdown (physical
distancing measures only), complete lockdown (enhanced containment measures including suspension
of all non-essential services), and curfews. In the meta-analysis we use a common estimate of 0%, as
estimates and standard errors are not available.


The study looks at the effect of NPIs on growth rates but does include an estimate of the effect on
total mortality at the end of the study period for employee face masks (-34%), business closure (29%). and SIPO (-18%), but not for school closures (which we therefore exclude). In reporting the
results of their counterfactual, they alter between "fewer deaths with NPI" and "more deaths without
NPI.” We have converted the latter to the former as estimate/(1+estimate) so "without business
closures deaths would be about 40% higher" corresponds to "with business closures deaths would be
about 29% lower.”

For each 1-unit increase in OxCGRT stringency index, the cumulative mortality decreases by 0.55
deaths per 100,000. The common estimate is the average effect in Europe and United States
respectively calculated as (Actual COVID-19 mortality) / (COVID-19 mortality with recommendation
policy) -1, where (COVID-19 mortality with recommendation policy) is calculated as ((Actual COVID19 mortality) - Estimate x Difference in stringency x population). Stringencies in Europe and United
States are equal to the average stringency from March 16th to April 15th 2020 (76 and 74
respectively) and the stringency for the policy based solely on recommendations is 44 following Hale
et al. (2020).

We use the two graphs to the left in figure 3, where we extract the data from the rightmost datapoint
(I.e. % impact of county lockdowns on Covid-19 deaths by 1/06/2020). We then take the average of
the estimates found in the two graphs, because it is unclear which estimate the author prefers.

We convert the effect in Figure 4 after 90 days (log difference -1.16 of a standard deviation change)
to deaths per million per stringency following footnote 3 (the footnote says "weekly deaths,” but we
believe this should be "daily deaths"), so the effect is e^-1.16 − 1 = −0.69 decline in daily deaths per
million per SD. We convert to total effect by multiplying with 90 days and "per point" by dividing with
SD = 22.3 (corresponding to the SD for the 147 countries with data before March 19, 2020 - using all
data yields similar results) yielding -2.77 deaths per million per stringency point. The common
estimate is the average effect in Europe and United States respectively calculated as (Actual COVID19 mortality) / (COVID-19 mortality with recommendation policy) -1, where (COVID-19 mortality
with recommendation policy) is calculated as ((Actual COVID-19 mortality) - Estimate x Difference in
stringency x population). Stringencies in Europe and United States are equal to the average stringency
from March 16th to April 15th 2020 (76 and 74 respectively) and the stringency for the policy based
solely on recommendations is 44 following Hale et al. (2020).

We use estimates for "Proportion of Cumulative Deaths Over the Population" (per 10,000) in Table 3.
We interpret this number as the change in cumulative deaths over the population in percent and is
therefore the same as our common estimate.

Policy implementations were assigned according to the first day that a country received a policy
stringency rating above 0 in the OxCGRT stay-at-home measure. As the value 1 is a recommendation
"recommend not leaving house,” we cannot distinguish recommendations from mandates, and, thus,
the study is not included in the meta-analysis.

The estimate with 8 weeks lag is insignificant, and preferable given our empirical strategy. However,
they use the 4-week lag when elaborating the model to differentiate between high- and low-income
countries, so the 4-week lag estimate for rich countries is used in our meta-analysis. Common
estimate is calculated as the average of the effect in Europe and United States, where the effect for
each is calculated as (policy stringency - recommendation stringency) x estimate.


We use weighted average of estimates for Table 4, 6, and 9. Since authors state that they place more
weight on the findings in Table 9, Table 9 weights by 50% while Table 4 and 6 weights by 25%. We
estimate the effect on total mortality from effect on growth rates based on authors calculation
showing that estimates of -0.049 and -0.060 reduces new deaths by 12.5% 15.3% respectively. We
use the same relative factor on other estimates.

6-Oct-20 medRxiv We use estimates from regression on strictness alone (Right panel in Table "Regression results, policy
strictness. Baseline is "policy not introduced within policy analysis period" in "Additional file"). We use
the average of 24 and 38 days from model 5. There are 23 relevant estimates in total (they analyze all
levels within the eight NPI measures in the OxCGRT stringency index). We calculate the effect of
each NPI (e.g. closing schools) as the average effect in all of U.S./Europe. This is done by calculating
the effect for each state/country based on the maximum level for each measure between Mar 16 and
Apr 15 (e.g. if all schools in a state/country are required to close (school closing level 3) the relevant
estimate for that state/level is -0.031 (average of -0.464 and 0.402). We assume all NPIs are effective
for 54 days (from March 15 to June 1 minus 24 days to reach full effect). Standard errors are
converted to common standard errors following the same process (this approach is unique for Stokes,
as our general approach is not possible).

It is unclear how they define "lockdown.” They write that "many countries [...] imposed lockdowns of
varying degrees, some imposing mandatory nationwide lockdowns, restricting economic and social
activity deemed to be non-essential,” and since all European countries and all states in the U.S.
imposed restrictions on economic (closing unessential businesses) and/or social (limiting large
gatherings) activity, we interpret this as all European countries and all U.S. states had mandatory
nationwide lockdowns. The effect of recommended lockdowns is set to zero in the meta-analysis, as
only one country was in this lockdown category (i.e. too few observations, cf. eligibility criteria). The
estimate for complete travel closure is -0.226 COVID-deaths per 100,000. Hence, if all of Europe
imposed complete travel closure, the total effect would be -0.266 * 748 million (population) * 10
(100,000/1,000,000) equal to 1,690 averted COVID-19 deaths. However, according to OxCGRT-data
European countries only had complete travel bans (Level 4: "Ban on all regions or total border
closure") in 11% of the time between March 16 and April 15, 2020. So the total effect is 1,690 * 11%
= 194 averted deaths. During the first wave 188,000 deaths in Europe was related to COVID-19 (by
June 30, 2020), so the total effect is approximated to -0.1% in Europe and, following the same logic,
0% in U.S., where no states closed their borders completely. We use the average, -0.05%, in the metaanalysis. The estimate for mandatory national lockdown is 0.166 (>0) COVID-deaths per 100,000.
Since all European countries (and U.S. states) imposed lockdowns, the total effect is 1,241 (553) extra
COVID-19 deaths corresponding to 0.7% (0.4%). We use the average of Europe and the U.S., 0.5%, in
the meta-analysis. Calculations of the effect of "Mandatory national lockdown" follow the same logic,
but we assume 100% of Europe and United States have had "Mandatory national lockdown.”


The study is not included in the meta-analysis, as they report the effect of NPIs on Rt which are not
easily converted to relative effects.

##### ABSTRACT

 Hiding the Elephant:  The Tragedy of COVID Policy and Its Economist Apologists[*]

In 2020 and 2021, the world witnessed policies that caused enormous net damage to nearly

every country. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new WELLBY currency in gauging the

costs and benefits of COVID policies and review the contributions of Australian economists

to the scholarly and public debates about these policies. Our analysis documents the

value of what was destroyed, the weak resistance mounted by the Australian economics

profession during this period, and the role played by many Australian economists as

apologists for Australia’s most catastrophic peacetime economic policy failure. We close

with ideas for working towards a better future.

###### Introduction[12] What were the costs of the main policies tried in Australia and elsewhere in response to the emergence on the world stage of COVID-19 in early 2020, in comparison to both an optimistic and a pessimistic estimate of their benefits? What was the received wisdom from previous decades about such policies and their effects, and how can what transpired be judged? What role did Australian economists������������������������������������������������� ���������������� play in influencing the debate about optimal policy-setting? In this paper, we offer our answers to these questions, in an effort to commence an internal reckoning within the Australian economics fraternity regarding this period.
 In the first part of the paper, we provide a summary of the arguments and statistics we and others using similar methodologies have been using to evaluate COVID policies. We calculate the costs and benefits of COVID policies around the world and with respect to Australia, placing these policy choices into historical context. In the second part of the paper, we report on the role played by Australian economists during this crisis moment in �����������������������
 The public function of economists involves producing traditional scholarly works, such as journal articles and working papers, but also making public pronouncements about policy through the media. To assess ���������������������������������������������������needs an analysis of both, which we provide in the second part of the paper. 
 Media contributions of economists help to inform the public of what economists think should be done, and they also influence what other economists think and are willing to say. As one of the editors of an Australian economics journal expressed it in an email:

 There is an enormous groupthink taking place on the one hand, and on the other the dissenters do not dare speak out. There is a lot of self-censorship going on � everyone �����������������������������������������������������������stance.

 Ortmann (2021) similarly opines (page 3) in his piece looking at these debates:

 �a very vocal group of economists, marching in lock-step with an equally vocal group of public-health researchers and epidemiologists, claimed to have models that suggest that prioritizing public health lexicographically was the way to go (Hamilton et al. 2020; Quiggin & Holden 2021). Never mind the absurd logic underlying the claims of the no-trade-off economists (Swan 2020; Frijters 2020), it was their

 refrain from engaging in the public debate.

 Self-censorship and pillorying are dysfunctional dynamics within any professional community. If left unaddressed, such dynamics marginalise free thought and critical thinking, downgrading the whole of economics to propaganda. These problems must be recognised and resolved for Australian economics to have a healthy future. To that end, in closing the second part of this paper we reflect on how the Australian economics fraternity can come to terms with its dubious role in this period and move forward together.
 To conclude the paper, we briefly discuss our main policy suggestions for avoiding a repeat of the policy choices in this period. Our suggestions consist of institutional changes designed to divorce public authority from money. Changes in this spirit would not merely allow more free thinking and diversity into our policy-making machinery in times of crisis, but would also address several other underlying societal problems that were corroding Australian productivity and well-being long before COVID-19, such as corruption and inequality. 
 PART 1: Evaluation of COVID policies
 We begin this section with a very quick stylised overview of what we have termed elsewhere the ������������������������������������������������������������������������������� of a new coronavirus and the country-by-country mimicking of unprecedented policies of ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������� reported damage directly from lockdown policies, to give the reader a sense of the relative scale of damage caused by policy choices, versus damage caused by the virus.
 Next, we introduce the WELLBY cost-benefit methodology that was developed to replace GDP and economic surplus as the main measures of value in cost-benefit analyses, arguing that the WELLBY is uniquely suited to capturing the many different types of effects of COVID policies in different life domains. We lay out the underpinning of that methodology and its current status in the world of policy making. We then apply the WELLBY methodology to an evaluation of the lockdown policies pursued, keeping our exposition as simple and transparent as possible. Our conclusion is that any reasonable approach unavoidably delivers the conclusion that the costs of the lockdown policies pursued during this period dwarf any plausible benefits by a huge factor. This conclusion is echoed in results produced by six independent groups in different Anglo-Saxon countries using the same methodology (De Neve et al. 2020, Ryan 2021, Lally 2021, Joffe 2021, Foster 2020c, Frijters and Krekel 2021, Frijters 2020b).
 1 Timeline of the policies In Frijters et al. (2021) we classify whole countries into one of three categories based on the �stringency index� produced by researchers in the Blavatnik School of Government at the

 of which is about the presence of a COVID-cautioning public information campaign and the ������������������������������������������������������������������������������: specifically, school closures, workplace closures, cancellation of public events, restrictions on gatherings, closure of public transport, restrictions on internal travel (stay-at-home requirements and restrictions on internal movements), and restrictions on foreign travel. The lowest value possible of the Blavatnik stringency index is 0 and the highest is 100, allowing us to define as a �lockdown day� a day on which the index score was above a threshold, which we set at 70. ������������������������������������������������������������ �����Extremist�.[4] Extremists are countries with at least 60 days of lockdown during 2020; minimalists are countries with a stringency index score of less than 40 on average in 2020; and pragmatists are the rest. By this definition and data, the world as a whole had spent around 8 months in lockdowns through September 1[st] 2021, the whole of Scandinavia is made up of pragmatists, and all major Anglo-Saxon countries (> 10 million citizens) are extremists.
 We first illustrate the timelines of policy implementation in these three groups, overlaying Australia�� policy decisions to enable comparisons. Figure 1 shows the path of the stringency of measures implemented on average in the minimalist, pragmatist, and extremist �������������������������������������������������������������������������������� path on a separate line. Like the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world, by our definition that is based on its Blavatnik policy stringency score pattern, Australia has been an extremist country. FIGURE 1

Minimalists Pragmatists Extremists Australia


###### First comparing the policy trajectories of the three major groups of countries during this period, we see a sharp ramping up of restrictions in mid-March 2020 followed by a trifurcation, in which extremist counties attained in mid-April the highest peak stringency across the three groups and then eased off gradually, whereas m��������������������� restrictions peaked slightly later and then lowered more quickly throughout the ensuing weeks. The policy settings of pragmatist countries peaked between the extremists and the minimalists in April 2020, fell markedly through June, and then hovered for the rest of the period between the average levels of stringency of the extremists and the minimalists. By approximately a year after restrictions began, extremists and pragmatists looked quite similar in terms of their levels of policy stringency, with minimalists remaining at markedly lower stringency levels than the other two groups.
 Figure 1 shows that Australia was comparatively quick out of the starting blocks to implement restrictions, exceeding the extremist countr���� average level of stringency in late January and early February 2020. In the period of peak restrictions for the average extremist country (M������������������������������������������������������������������ average settings of pragmatist countries. Starting in July 2020, however � when Victoria tightened its already strong shelter-in-place directives and suspended international arrivals into Tullamarine airport � ������������������������������������������������������������� extremist country, and it stayed there for many weeks. The suspension of activities around the Christmas and end-of-������������������������������������������ency score pop up again above the extremist average around the turn of the year. While in the autumn months of 2021 Australia started to look more like a pragmatist or even a minimalist country in terms of its policy settings, by mid-year 2021 its policy stringency was back up above the extremist average.

###### Stringent measures were supposedly instituted in order to prevent, or at least stall, COVID deaths. What, then, was the path of deaths with COVID-19 in each of these three groups of countries? To answer this question, we reproduce below as our Figure 2 what is Figure 1 in Frijters et al. (2021). The data on deaths is taken from the Oxford Blavatnik data, which in turn comes from governments themselves. These data are not uncontroversial, having been argued to be a gross over-estimate by some (e.g., Pasquariello and Stranges 2020) and an under-estimate by others (e.g., Chatterjee 2020).

 The most crucial fact to draw from Figure 2 is that none of the 20-odd countries in the minimalist and pragmatist groups experienced the �COVID Armageddon� (more than 0.5% of their population dying with COVID) predicted by many early in the period, and in fact these countries experienced only a fraction of the deaths per capita experienced in extremist countries, which sometimes were their neighbours (e.g., Denmark (pragmatist) and Germany (extremist)). Also striking is that over 90% of COVID deaths occurred many months after lockdowns, begging the question of whether the lockdowns prevented anything or whether, at best, they merely postponed waves of infection. At the very minimum, Figure 2 proves that the many predictions of inevitably huge numbers of COVID deaths following a failure to lock down, on which lockdown policies in extremist countries around the world were based, were plainly wrong.

###### 1.1 School closures
 One policy area of particular note, as it impacts so heavily upon the welfare of the young, is school closures. In April 2020, the same Blavatnik group that has tracked the stringency of lockdown measures around the world produced a report[5] whose Figure 1 we reproduce below as our Figure 3 to illustrate the scale of the decisions made early in the GCP by leaders around the world to pull children out of school.
 FIGURE 3
 Percentage of Students Affected by COVID School Closures, Global

 In past generations, school closures may have been more disruptive than during the modern era, due to the modern availability of online learning as a substitute. However, even under the generous assumption that online learning is 90% as good as in-person learning in terms of building future productivity, Foster (2020a) estimates a wage loss to �������������������������� � those people in the cohort of schoolchildren suffering from

 between A$50 and A$100 million. This figure is a lower bound. It ignores the social cost of the widened gap between well-off and poorly-off students that school closures have produced (see below). It excludes losses in the sphere of public returns to education (e.g., in terms of levels of violence or unemployment), all private losses that are not captured by wages (e.g., damage from lower mental health and bad habits), and all losses accruing after mid-June 2020. School closures surged again later in the GCP in many states. 
 A good review of the various negative effects of school closures, particularly for the most vulnerable children, is in the Norwegian case study by Thornsteinsen et al. (2021). The main takeaway is that children of well-organised and digitally skilled parents have seen few negative consequences, but that children of disadvantaged groups with relatively poor preparation have seen a lot of damage to their progress, sometimes even including regression in cognitive levels as a result of the lack of intellectual stimulus. We conclude that school closures can be seen as inequality increasing, and an investment in future social disruption. ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� closures implemented earlier in 2021.
 1.2 Border closures
 Another notable policy arena is border closures. Australia is acutely affected by international border closures because of our economically important tourism and international education sectors, and more profoundly because of our status as a nation of immigrants. The latest data from the ABS, captured in June 2020,[6] report that more than 7 �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� immigrants. Immigrants disproportionately represent the productive portion of the age distribution.
 New immigration essentially came to an abrupt halt in the COVID era, meaning Australia has foregone about 120,000 skilled immigrant arrivals per year, and a similar number of students. These figures represent a large loss of free human capital and education exports. The international tourism sector has similarly seen its business reduce to almost nothing, with businesses having had to orient towards domestic tourism (Grozinger and Parsons 2020). Insolvencies during this period in Australia, which have been estimated to be the highest in the world,[7] will contain a large portion of small businesses with a tourism or hospitality component that will not reopen when borders finally do.
 Whether Australia will regain its historically high international flows of people (migrants, students, tourists) is uncertain and depends on whether and how badly ������������������ has now been tainted. Long, expensive quarantine requirements seem incompatible with large flows of people to Australia. Internal border restrictions similarly have disrupted the

 reputation for being welcoming has probably �������������������������������COVID-era policies. The way in which temporary visa holders (including students) have been treated during the COVID era,[8] receiving very little government support and the distinct message that Australia wanted them to go home, also bodes ill for brand Australia.[9]
 2 Expected and actual damage, in brief Ex ante, what damage was expected to ensue from the unprecedent polices described above, and what damage did they actually cause?
 To help the reader prepare for the answer to these questions, we start by offering four pieces of relevant information.

 1. The Nuremberg code, drawn up to prevent a recurrence of the Nazi experiments,
 explicitly requires a mass medical experiment (such as a population-wide lockdown justified on the grounds of protecting public health) to be supported by reasonable evidence that the damage of the intended cure to population health is likely to be less than the benefit. Failure to have that evidence, and to implement the experiment anyway, is a crime against humanity.[10]
 2. In March 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (2020) estimated the health
 damage from lockdowns and associated disruptions to normal health services to be at least 3 times larger than the anticipated gains of lockdowns � evidence that the Dutch government buried for over a year. UK government actuaries estimated in April 2020 that up to 200,000 deaths would be caused by health service disruption during lockdowns (compared to 130,000 claimed eventual COVID deaths), evidence that did not come to light until December 2020 after Freedom of Information requests (Knapton 2020).
 3. The standing advice prior to March 2020 on pandemic policies in Victoria, Australia,
 the UK, the US, and much of Europe was that lockdowns were not recommended, in part because they were estimated to be too costly and unsustainable (Sabhlok 2020, Kulldorff 2020). In their review of what to do once a new respiratory virus went pandemic, Inglesby et al. (2006) dismissed lockdowns as an unviable option.
 4. If you take their estimated economic damage due to lockdowns and apply their high end threshold that the value of a statistical life (VSL) is 9 million AUD, and then adjust for the remaining quality years of life expected of COVID victims, then in May 2020,

basis that medical experimentation is exactly what went on here, regardless of what AAP fact-checkers may contend.

 destroying at least 4 times more life years than they were saving. 

 2.1 How to judge policies and outcomes? Introducing the WELLBY  Life satisfaction is the answer to the question, ����������������������������������������������� �����������Such a question already appears in many social science surveys worldwide and captures in a simple measure the extent to which a person is happy, content, and thriving.

 One WELLBY ������������������ is defined as one unit of life satisfaction on the 0-10 answer scale for this question, for one person, for one year. The aim of public policy pursuing human wellbeing as the objective is then the anticipated stream of subjective wellbeing of the population:


###### �

�


###### ����[�]�[�] �

�


###### ��� ������ ���� �


###### Time t is in whatever unit is most convenient (years, months), �[�] is the pure social discount rate on the future, the individual counter i sums over the relevant population (which will change over time), ��� is a positive weight that could differ over individuals, for instance because some are dual citizens, and ���� is the life satisfaction of person i at time t. ��� is the zero-point of life satisfaction, denoting the level of life satisfaction equivalent to death, crucial for making trade-offs between the quality of life and the length of life. If the unit of time is in years, ����� ���� � is the number of WELLBYs contributed by a living individual to societal subjective wellbeing. A unit of WELLBY is treated as equivalent across individuals, independent of the person (complete with his personal characteristics) who is experiencing a unit of wellbeing.

 The WELLBY-based methodology is meant eventually to replace most existing standard economic cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) which are explained in Boardman et al. (2017). CBAs differ by country and government department, but all are oriented towards the measurement of economic surplus, value added, or GDP-like notions of value. Economic surplus is itself ������������������������������������������������������������������s are restricted to counting market prices or observable outcomes. The bundle of things valued by economists in CBAs is quite broad, but all link in some way to prices and market demand and supply curves. It is uncontroversial to say that classic CBA is accepted as not directly measuring what matters to people, but instead aims to infer what matters from market prices, willingness-to-pay studies, or other inferences from choices.

 Standard CBA practice has four key inherent problems. The first is that many of the most important things in life, like children or friendships, are not things people buy and sell and are inherently interpreted as non-monetary. As a result, changes to things like friendships or other warm relations that are not signalled in a marketplace are left out of CBA considerations. The second is that negative externalities, such as status externalities of

10

###### p, p p y p
 CBAs. The third is that the state is involved in the supply of many public goods that have clear benefits but no obvious market price, such as a clean environment or national art programmes. The fourth is that there are many areas where it is totally unreasonable to presume people know how beneficial this or that good is to them and hence that choice behaviour is informative, such as mental health and the services that improve mental �������������������������������������������� (Dulleck and Kershbaumer 2006). As a result, current policy that is informed by existing CBAs heavily underinvests in these blind spots (i.e., the environment, mental health, and social life (Frijters and Krekel 2021)).

 The alternative WELLBY-based methodology was first published in Frijters et al. (2020) and has been adopted by the UK Treasury (2021) for policy evaluations and appraisal throughout UK institutions.[11] New Zealand has recently followed suit. It is also being advocated for other countries (e.g., Helliwell et al. 2021). A large handbook by Frijters and Krekel (2021) lays out many aspects of the methodology, which has by now been applied to evaluate lockdowns in the UK (De Neve et al. 2020), Ireland (Ryan 2021), New Zealand (Lally 2021), Canada (Joffe 2021), Australia (Foster 2020c), the world, and various countries in continental Europe (Frijters and Krekel 2021, Frijters 2020b).
 Each of the dozen or so WELLBY-based cost-benefit analyses of COVID lockdowns has concluded that the costs of lockdowns are a vast multiple of their likely benefits, on a scale ranging from 4:1 to 1000:1. This is one reason why the most prominent wellbeing economists[12] in the UK have written pieces highly critical of lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere. Importantly, the vast wellbeing literature contained enough predictive information about the likely economic and mental health effects of lockdown policies that such judgments could be made right at the start of the COVID period (e.g., Frijters 2020c), which was also true for calculations based on physical health effects that were available to some governments as early as March and April 2020 (Dutch Ministry of Economics 2020, Knapton 2020). For example, Miles et al. (2020) claimed a 50:1 ratio of costs versus benefits of lockdowns in the UK, looking only at physical health.
 Each aspect of the basic maximand shown above demands technical standards. Those advocated by Frijters and Krekel (2021) are to take 1.5% for �[�], a level of 2 for ���, and a level of 8 for the expected ����  of a healthy person, meaning that a healthy person contributes to societal wellbeing 6 WELLBYs per year, which is then also the loss of a person experiencing one year fewer of healthy life.

11 A key attraction of using the WELLBY is that the literature on the determinants of life satisfaction includes something like
200,000 studies going back since the 1930s, including many causal-design studies, such as recent ones drawing on large-scale
lotteries (Lindqvist et al. 2020) and naturalisation policy changes in Germany (Dahl et al. 2021). This means that we already know
a lot about what a government could do if it wants to increase its WELLBYs, and how to avoid WELLBY losses.

###### p g p g g
 Frijters and Krekel (2021) convert the mainstream productivity estimates of the UK National Health Service into the estimate that around 4500 AUD of government expenditure produces one WELLBY. This differs from the willingness to pay for a WELLBY, for which the value lies between 10,000 AUD and 20,000 AUD (UK Treasury 2021).[13] This means that government expenditures generate a year of healthy life � i.e., six WELLBYs � with every 27,000 AUD (low) to 120,000 AUD (high). The threshold value used by the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) in Australia above which a drug or medical intervention that saves one good year of life will be purchased is around 50,000 AUD (Wang et al. 2018). This number applies to buying medicines affecting millions of Australians. 
 A 1%-of-GDP increase in national debt would mean a reduction of 22 billion AUD in government expenditure when that debt is eventually paid back.[14] The above calculations indicate that this in turn will cost the repaying country between 183,000 and 815,000 WELLBYs, which equates to between 31,000 and 136,000 years of life spent with a life satisfaction of 8 out of 10. In the remainder of what follows, we will use the PBS-implied threshold number that 8333 AUD worth of government expenditure produces approximately one WELLBY,[15] translating to about 4 million AUD ����������������������a whole life via government spending. In turn, this means that a 1% decrease in future government expenditure implies 2.64 million fewer future WELLBYs.[16] As we discuss below, both lower and higher estimates exist for the statistical value of life, while the 4 million AUD number is routinely used in practice in Australia when making health decisions for the whole population.[17]
 2.1.1 Lockdown WELLBY calculations
 The strategy of a WELLBY CBA for an intervention like a lockdown is best illustrated by Figure 4. It is essentially an envelope-theorem strategy whereby one tries to approximate the difference between two streams of wellbeing by what one knows of the estimated ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������for values for the rest of time via an evaluation of how particular capital stocks, like the size of the population and government debt, have been affected by the shock.[18] Implementing it

and the amount that an individual person would pa���������������������������������������������
14 This assumes that real interest rates and discount rates are the same, which is a standard assumption, so that the timing of
the expense reduction is irrelevant.
15 Six WELLBYs equate approximately to one QALY����������������������������-year change in life satisfaction.
16 The figure is the result of dividing the future expenditure reduction of 22 billion AUD by the amount of government
����������������������������������������
17 One might argue that marginal health expenses are probably not all that cost-effective relative to mental health expenses and
many education activities, or direct welfare (Frijters and Krekel, 2021). Still, presuming the marginal productivity of expenses in
one large area of government (the PBS) is the same as those for the other major areas conforms to the economic logic of
rational budget allocation within government.

 estimated streams, like the wellbeing lost from a COVID death.
 FIGURE 4

 The basic implementation of a wellbeing cost-benefit analysis of COVID lockdowns has been to focus on the effects of lockdowns on economic and social life in Western countries, and to build in a clear bias towards concluding that lockdowns were worth it. The main deliberately biased assumption has been to presume that lockdowns avoid a loss of life equal to a generous estimate of the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 (like 0.2%, higher than the survey estimate by Ioannidis 2021), thereby taking the extreme assumption that lockdowns truly prevent all COVID deaths, which was not expected ex ante in March 2020 and became extremely dubious ex post for Europe and the Americas in particular (see Lally 2021). Indeed, an author writing for the Brownstone Institute � whose senior scientific director is Martin Kulldorff, one of the lead authors of the Great Barrington Declaration signed by over 80,000 scientists � compiled a list of 400 studies finding that lockdowns have had no noticeable positive effect on cases or deaths,[19] where the dominant research methodology is cross-country analysis or standard time-series analysis. 
 While we think it likely that some components of the Australian lockdown response, such as international border closures, have prevented earlier waves of COVID deaths, we do not regard that as clearly established because the whole region of the world where Australia is located (which includes China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Vietnam) has recorded very low numbers of COVID deaths � on the order of 1/10[th] the toll seen in Europe and the Americas. This makes it possible that the region as a whole has high levels of pre-existing immunity

 deaths or relatively low transmission rates. Further investigation of the impact of these characteristics would be a scientific approach to the observation of low death counts in ����������������������������������������������������The list of characteristics that might be involved includes climate, fauna, social habits, diet, sunlight exposure, and many others.[20]
 In our various wellbeing CBAs from 2020-2021, we have taken two main possible counterfactuals. One is described by the trends and policies from before 2020, thus presuming a business-as-usual response (some lockdown advocates �������������������������� ���������������to the coronavirus. What one then has in mind is a public health response not much different to what is seen in response to yearly flu variations, which also often involve crowded hospitals and attempts at selective screening. The business-as-usual counterfactual simply entails following the pre-2020 plans and habits for what to do in case of a pandemic of the (mild) severity that occurred. Crucially, it presumes the absence of any government-maintained panic. The difficulty in judging the effects of actual policies is then in gauging what fraction of the results seen in Australia to ascribe to national policies, and what fraction to the changes seen in other countries that would have happened in Australia anyway, unconditional on policies. In gauging this we have by and large been guided by estimates from the mainstream. One is then still in the business of judging the totality of many different policies, without trying to evaluate every single policy on its own.

 Another counterfactual we have sometimes constructed is to take the Swedish experience as a base case for the policies and outcomes other Western countries could have had relative to 2019 trends. Sweden did not spend a single day in lockdown. Most schools were open, no Swede was prevented from leaving the country, and no Swede needing to be socially close to others was prevented from doing so. Using Sweden as the counterfactual means presuming that the deviation in Sweden from Swedish trends pre-2020 would have been experienced by other countries, adjusted for population size, had they taken the same policy path that Sweden trod. More sophisticated counterfactuals are easy to construct, for example if one wants to allow for the possibility of regional idiosyncratic trends, or sectoral differences between countries. The reader will see later why the precise nature of the counterfactual does not matter for the bottom line: the costs of lockdown policies so vastly outweigh any reasonable estimate of their benefits that any small adjustment to the counterfactual scenario is irrelevant.
 In various calculations aiming to evaluate lockdown policies, some authors have tried to include the values of large lists of things that might matter, such as pollution, crime, road deaths, suicides, �long COVID�, unemployment, private incomes losses, disruptions in the developing world, and so on (Miles et al. 2020; de Neve et al. 2021; Joffe 2020). Yet, by

exposure to other coronaviruses; Meyers et al (2021), studying the impact of nasal rinsing, a cultural practice more common in
East Asian societies relative to other regions; and Souris et al (2021), studying the potential role of region-specific fauna in giving
rise to prior deep immunity.

###### y p
 benefits for a developed Western country like Australia. Here we focus only on those four.
 The first key number is the plausible WELLBY benefits of lockdowns, based on estimates of COVID deaths averted and years of life saved per COVID death. On the number of COVID deaths averted, typically wellbeing authors have made some heroically generous-to- lockdown assumption, such as that lockdowns are immediately followed by a 100% effective vaccine which arrives too late in the counterfactual scenario. A high estimate is that 0.2% of �����������������lives are saved, which for perspective is 140% of the lives actually lost due to COVID-19 in Sweden, much higher than any COVID death rate in the time zones near Oceania (e.g., Japan, China, Thailand), and higher than the meta-study estimate of the IFR of 0.15% by Ioannidis (2021, first published by the World Health Organisation). On the question of how many years of good health are lost per COVID death, the common finding in Europe and China has been that the average COVID death occurs at about age 80, in a person who has several underlying health problems. The first-flush approach some have taken is to say that the average 80-year-old has another 10 years to go, so that the loss of one average COVID victim equates to the loss of 10 years of healthy life (Ferreira et al. 2020). Yet, for someone aged 80, having existing health conditions is predictive of a lower residual life expectancy of only around 5 additional years (Frijters 2020b). One should furthermore realise that the quality of life is lower for those with severe health conditions, and that about half the COVID deaths were among the institutionalised elderly with particularly low life expectancies and bad health conditions. All of this means that 3 good years of life is a generous estimate of what is lost on average per COVID death (Frijters 2020b). In all, this would mean for Australia that a generous estimate of what lockdowns have averted via reduced COVID deaths is 155,000 good years of life,[21] or 930,000 WELLBYs.
 The second crucial number is the loss of WELLBYs during lockdowns via reduced mental health, loneliness, worse physical health, idleness, loss of purpose, and so on. Different estimates now exist for different countries, such as a loss of around 0.5 in life satisfaction from UK-style lockdowns via social distancing measures (Fujiwara et al 2020). For Australia, the monthly ANU survey of around 3,000 Australians analysed by Biddle et al. (2020) has found a remarkably close correspondence between lockdowns in a state and life satisfaction that also corresponds to about 0.5 loss in life satisfaction for a Victoria-style lockdown. This means that for Australia as a whole, a 1-month lockdown means a loss of 1.1 million WELLBYs. A similar figure can be recovered by comparing Australia to Sweden, a country with not a single day of lockdown and that experienced a COVID wave.
 The third crucial number is just how much national debt increases due to lockdowns themselves, as opposed to in response to the changes in the international economy. This is essentially a measure of future reductions in government expenditure, as explained above, which in turn is the channel through which lockdowns produce by far their biggest

 directly incurred in the present period, but also the effect of changes in economic activity. In Australia, the debt-to-GDP ratio has already risen about 10% compared to previous trends and is expected to rise another 25% at least relative to pre-2020 (Reserve Bank of Australia 2021), largely as directly caused by policies such as subsidies for workers to stay home and expenditures on tests. In Sweden, by comparison, debt only rose 6% and the country already runs a balanced budget (Trading Economics 2022). In Australia, printing money to cover debt carries an inflation risk. One could thus argue that the Australian �������������������������������������� ���������������������-of-GDP worth of government debt, judging by how many months of lockdowns so far the average Australian has endured. Yet, if we are again generous and only ascribe 50% of the Australian government debt increase to lockdown policies, then we should still conclude that an increase of at least 1%-of-GDP worth of government debt is caused per month of lockdowns, costing 2.64 million WELLBYs via reductions in future government expenditure.
 The fourth crucial number, which was the basis of the early calculations in Miles et al. (2020) and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (2020), is just how many health problems are created in the future by mandated disruptions to normal health services. Estimates of this number vary and are controversial, as one might imagine, but a UK government report (Department of Health and Social Care et al. (2020)) concluded that the likely number in the UK was an additional loss of 100,000 preventable deaths via undiagnosed cancers and similar preventable problems. Those succumbing to these problems should be expected to have had far more than just 3 good years left to live, with 5 good years being a low estimate. Ascribing that loss to the 4 months of lockdowns in the UK noted in the report and converting to the Australian context implies a loss of about 276,000 WELLBYs per month of lockdowns in Australia from disruptions to health services. Additionally, IVF treatments have been disrupted in Australia because such treatments were considered inessential, which then carries another 370,000 WELLBYs lost per month via unborn planned children. It is a difficult philosophical question how much to count these actively prevented births, but if they are counted then the health cost disruption is easily double per month what conventional health estimates indicate.
 Less crucial and more debatable categories of costs, in decreasing order of how large we think they are relative to the above, include: the eventual loss of trust in government and media from the violations of liberties and propaganda during this period; the missed free gift of the human capital coming into Australia via skilled migration; the damage of school disruptions ���������������������� social and emotional development and future tax receipts; ��������������������������������������������������������������������������� and UK); the loss of human capital among workers prevented from gaining experience; and the benefits of accelerated medical vaccine technology versus decelerated technology of other sorts. What is probably not affected at all or is very minor relative to the four numbers above are changes to suicides, long COVID, long-term unemployment, and pollution. See Frijters et al. (2021) for a lengthier discussion and references.

###### Where do these four key numbers leave us? They tell us that a loss equivalent to what would be lost in total from COVID-19, assuming a highly pessimistic 0.2% mortality rate, is suffered in 4 weeks of lockdowns via the direct mental health and other wellbeing costs of locking down the whole population; in 11 days of lockdowns via increased government debt that inevitably leads to reduced future government expenditure via the government budget constraint; and in 2 months of lockdowns via eventual losses from disrupted normal health services and IVF treatments. Every 7 days of lockdown thus leads to a wellbeing loss equivalent to the loss from COVID-19 (again assuming a 0.2% mortality rate) of 51,600 Australian COVID deaths. Melbourne suffered 29 weeks of lockdown between January 2020 ������������������������������������������������������������������������������, and that is making the optimistic assumption that lockdown losses are now over for Melbourne.
 In sum, as a rule of thumb, an Australian lockdown costs 30% of the time spent in it via both direct reductions in the wellbeing of life during them (about 8 of the 30%), future reductions in government expenditure (about 20 of the 30%) and other health costs that they produce (2 of the 30%). For every 10 days of lockdowns, it is as if one took away 3 days of life from everyone. Taking away 3 out 10 days from a whole population of 25.8 million adds up. The average human in the world has seen almost 34 weeks of lockdowns since January 2020, adding up to a staggering worldwide loss of human wellbeing.
 The costs of lockdowns are simply in a different ballpark from their benefits if one considers the wellbeing of the population as the object of policy. Even if one quadruples the above estimates of benefits and divides the estimates of costs by a factor of four, one would still conclude that lockdowns are not worth it. 
 One can only arrive at ��������������������������������������������� chooses a different ������������������������������������������������������������������� ignores the big costs and makes unsupportable assumptions on the benefits. As one example of the latter, none of the three big-ticket cost items discussed above shows up in the pro-lockdown simulation cost-benefit model of Kompas et al. (2021), whose analysis was first publicly released in 2020.
 Our calculations above have been stacked deliberately in favour of lockdowns���������� and against ascribing negative effects to lockdowns. If one considers that lockdowns were initiated not to prevent COVID ������������������������������������������������������COVID cases over a longer period of time rather than prevent them from occurring (which was deemed impossible at the time), then one immediately realises that they were not anticipated to prevent a large number of deaths. Their supposed anticipated benefit depended on how effective hospital treatments were going to be relative to care at home, and whether a large proportion of those infected in the COVID wave that was indeed averted would otherwise show up in vain at hospitals. Given that hospitals could do little

 flattening the curve had any reasonable argument going for it.
 Further, the costs of lockdowns are far worse still when we consider the effects they have on poor countries who have not merely seen their trade disrupted, but have also been given a disastrous example to follow. Joffe (2020) documents in great detail the many health costs paid by poor countries and the website collateralglobal.org, an outgrowth of the Great Barrington Declaration, tracks them. Poor countries have seen non-COVID inoculation programs disrupted, food prices rise 30%, the number of extremely poor and at risk rise dramatically, a significant reduction in access to clean birth, and other large shocks. There has been no serious acknowledgement of this in Australia, but the poor world has been affected terribly by lockdowns.
 Some comparison with the effects of peacetime downturns in Australian history is useful. From the numbers above, we can see that disruption to social life can be extremely detrimental via its effect on mental health, but that unproductive increases in government debt are the biggest-ticket item. The combination means that recessions are the main peacetime negative-wellbeing events. During the GFC in 2008-2010, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose 10-15% per year, similar to the rise in COVID times. The shock to mental health and wellbeing is also similar in large recessions (cf. ������������������������������and in lockdowns. Yet, whereas lockdowns lead to debt that would not reasonably occur without lockdowns, debts incurred during ���������recessions prevent hardship among those unavoidably unemployed. Most importantly, recessions have been a feature of capitalist economies for centuries, without any indication of some way of preventing them from happening, so the suffering and debt they involve is not ���������������������� by policy. 
 Our conclusion is that COVID lockdowns have been the worst policy disaster in Australian peacetime history.
 PART TWO: The role of economists in influencing COVID policy
 We now move to a summary of the general reactions of economists worldwide to the GCP, paying particular attention to what happened within the Australian economics community. 
 3 How did economists react to the unfolding catastrophe? As the profession to which society turns for cool-headed, objective (if occasionally dismal) advice on how to maximise total social welfare, economics was the natural place to expect resistance to be mounted against the welfare-destroying policies of lockdowns. Did we deliver?

 produced cost-benefit analyses, ran scenarios on the effects of lockdown on the macroeconomy, and pointed out the losses from proposed policies. Sanjeev Sabhlok (Sabhlok 2020) documents at length the presence and activities of these dedicated insider economists in Australia and in the state of Victoria in particular, where he was one of these economists. Sabhlok resigned when, to his mind, he saw his government committing crimes against its own population and his employer would not allow him to speak this opinion. We have been in communication with many more professional economists in departments of the states and Commonwealth, charged with making, reviewing, and advising on resource allocation decisions on behalf of millions every day, who held similar views as Sabhlok but kept silent for fear of losing their jobs.
 In February and March 2020, as governments around the world were captured in quick succession by the control-and-lock-down ideology, economists in the more refined worlds of academia, consulting, and think tanks were making their voices heard individually and through national opinion surveys regarding whether the path being charted was wise. In the majority of cases, the judgment was favourable.
 In the United States, which some hold to be the global hub of elite economic thought, 44 academic economists from Ivy League universities and other top departments were asked in late March 2020 by the IGM Forum at the University of Chicago about their agreement with the following statement:[23]

 �Abandoning severe lockdowns at a time when the likelihood of a resurgence in infections remains high will lead to greater total economic damage than sustaining the lockdowns to eliminate the resurgence risk.�

 We note first that this is a leading question, as its wording alone invites the responder to agree, and assumes a connection between lockdowns and viral trajectory. Still, PhD- qualified economists working for world-class universities would presumably have the skills needed to resist implicit pressure towards having a particular opinion on a survey question directly related to their expertise. However, not a single American economist in the group went on record as disagreeing with the statement above. Only 14% of the 44 respondents responded �����������, and 7% abstained.[24]
 In Europe, the situation was slightly better. Asked by the same group running the American survey of academic economists about their agreement with the following statement, 75%

 that:[25]

 �Severe lockdowns � including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations ���������������������� are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures��

 The strong agreement on public display may well have masked private doubts of some academics who were afraid for their friendships or their careers. Others have made the case that the image of consensus was not matched by actual broad agreement with the measures.[26] Yet in the face of so much outward agreement, the power of social signalling in driving people into a common pattern of choices (as studied in Bose et al. 2020 and by many others) must have been overwhelming during this period. The individual rewards for being the �salmon swimming upstream� at such a moment are mainly internal, flowing from an alignment of action to pre-existing moral commitment. By contrast, the rewards for agreeing with the majority opinion are immediate and probably difficult to resist. 
 Some small groups did not follow the mainstream. One group of economists that took a sceptical view of lockdowns as the right policy response to COVID-19 from very early on ����������������������������������������as previously mentioned openly toed a highly sceptical line on lockdowns.[27] Given that the economics profession presents itself as a social science with a moral charter, i.e., to seek the outcomes that maximise total social welfare (see Hazlitt 1946) regardless of other considerations such as social approval, from the standpoint of professional integrity and morality all economists should have been willing to play the salmon. Reality proved different.
 3.1 ��������������������������������������������COVID policy debate Several COVID policy pieces were published in journals, working paper series, and official reports by Australian economists during this era. For space reasons we cannot provide an in-depth review of every scholarly contribution here. We instead select one exemplar article that illustrates the willingness of economist authors to follow the groupthink, and then report on the scholarly contributions about Australian COVID policy that are returned by a standard literature search that might be performed by a naïve student researching this period.
 We already encountered the cost-benefit analysis of Kompas et al. (2021), a simulation model of the type used by many others. These authors were willing to assume a COVID IFR of 1.7% for adults, that lockdowns would be one-off final solutions to COVID risks, that total

 mental health and physical health disruptions caused by lockdowns were irrelevant. We see these assumptions and argument as analogous to a concentration camp guard insisting that the camps extended the life of their inmates because surely more would have died had some not received camp rations. The camp analogy contains the same combination of pointing to something very small that supposedly has a benefit (camp rations, paralleling COVID prevention through social isolation and related measures) while not recognising the enormous and immediate damage of the whole enterprise (the destruction in the camps, paralleling the negative effects of lockdowns). As with concentration camps, the damage done by lockdowns was recognised and seen as obvious for decades prior, making it wondrous in both cases that adherents have been able to look away from the damage.
 Even the initial �����������������������������������justify lockdowns (Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (2020)) were not as outlandish as this, because at least the ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� and benefits were going to be, which is also an admission that they should not have been used as the justification for any policy, especially one as draconian as lockdowns.
 How then should we view the journals that published studies like Kompas et al. (2021)? The omission of the huge negative effects and the unsupportable assumptions about the supposed beneficial effects of the policy examined do not count as science in our eyes, but as ex-post groupthink. For the health of science moving forward, our judgement is that such journals should disband.
 However, this is not the only scholarly paper penned by an Australian economist about COVID policy. In Table 1 below, we list the scholarly works with Australia-based economists in the author line that are returned from a ProQuest search of journals, working paper series, and reports for contributions published between January 2020 and December 2021 ������������COVID��������������������������������������������������������������������� Kompas et al. (2021) is naturally included in this list. We classify each contribution into one of the three categories used above ������������������������������������COVID-19 � minimalist, pragmatist, or extremist � based on a review of the stance the authors take towards the Australian G������������COVID policy decisions. Those economists who defended existing highly restrictive policies, or argued for more restrictions, were classified as extremists; those who advocated largely for a return to normal but perhaps with additional measures targeted to the vulnerable (essentially in conformity to pre-2020 policy approaches for a health threat of the magnitude of COVID-19) were classified as minimalists; and those who argued in favour of some of the policy prescriptions being taken that were not recommended pre-2020 for such situations, but against others, were classified as pragmatists. In some cases this stance was obvious, while in others, it was more nuanced or only expressed as a side-line of the paper.

###### Table 1 shows that in their scholarly works, Australian economists were remarkably balanced in their perspectives on the COVID policy choices of Australia. In fact, with three contributions each, the categories ��������������� ���������������� are the most populous, followed by �extremist�, with two contributions. Perhaps more striking about this table is the paucity of scholarly contributions. This search indicates that while health scientists were busy publishing hundreds of papers on COVID-19, during the nearly two years in which they bore witness to �����������������������������������the most damaging economic policies in over a generation, Australian economists only produced eight easily locatable scholarly pieces in which comment was made on the wisdom of those policies.  Even accounting for delays in publishing, this is a modest haul considering the significance of the policy problem that had arisen. No scholarly paper produced by an Australian economist has directly evaluated the welfare impact of the ���������������������������������� economic (and other) freedoms of its people in pursuit of lower direct damage from COVID- 19.[28]
 ������������������������������������ during this period to The Conversation, a popular outlet for the transmission of academic opinion to the common man, were far more prolific and quick to market � unlike in peer-reviewed publishing, publication delays for blogs are basically non-existent � but they were also less balanced. While a few sceptical pieces were published,[29] the great majority of blogs in The Conversation expressed support for ������������COVID restrictions.
 An entire series of pieces on The Conversation by one economist and his co-authors argued for lockdowns, and vehemently against those who claimed their costs outweighed their benefits.[30] One of the first of these, ������������������������������������������������������ (Holden and Preston 2020), contains the basic error of assigning the value of a whole life of 80 years to each COVID death. The evaluation of policies that target totals of life years and deaths across individuals should, we argue, treat the value of these respective quantities as

 designed to do). In support of this contention, Kip Viscusi, arguably the grandfather of the value of a statistical life methodology, admitted on ABC Radio National in June 2021 that:

 Well the quantity of life still matters. So how much life you have left matters. So based on the value of a statistical life you can calculate the value of a statistical life year, and those sorts of numbers have actually been calculated for Australia, to use the value of $182,000 for a life-��������������������������������������������������������� ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� �������������������������������������������������������������������������ed the fact that ����������������������������������������������������������������������� Government �����������������������������������������������������������������������s the pandemic. So, how much is it worth to keep old people alive on ventilators? Tha������� issue that, I think, has come more to the fore with the pandemic than in any other ���������������������������[31]

 Once this mistake is corrected, the conclusions of Holden ������������� (2020) analysis should be counted as opposed to lockdown policies. Nonetheless, the authors resisted this conclusion, saying in a later piece that it is �intellectual malpractice� to count an averted death differentially by how much life is saved.[32] By that logic, the country should be willing to spend 8 million AUD for every additional second of life extended by any means possible. Postponing a single death by a day in incremental steps of one second (i.e., ���������������� every second) would exhaust all productive capacity of the country. To our minds, such arguments are not merely incompatible with 200 years of mainstream economic thinking and government health policy (both of which count streams of utility), but betray an inability to admit a fact that would imply deviation from groupthink.
 Similarly confused arguments were on display in two Conversation articles that essentially argued that health services paid for by a higher GDP have no health benefits, begging the question of why we then ever had a health service.[33] They motivated their stance by noting that in the short run one cannot see health improvements in the general population from increased health services. Yet, the reality is that the benefits of functioning health systems are very spread out over time. It is a standard point in the health economics literature that short-run data is useless in estimating the long-run benefits of normal health services, like screening for cancers that take many months to grow from innocuous to life-threatening (Ballester et al. 2019, Stuckler et al. 2010).

###### An article from May 2020 in The Conversation reported on the views of the collection of top Australian economists polled in the National Economic Panel, delivering a clear majority (34 ���������������������������������������������������������������������mented in Australia.[34] In an even more striking display of collective extremism, The Conversation also published a piece in April 2020 that was later referenced by other economists writing in the national media (see Table 2 below) and garnered the nickname of �������������-������������������� piece took the form of an open letter authored by four economists and signed by an additional 250 economists. The letter expressed the view, without providing evidence to support it, that the extremist policy of shutting down the economy was the correct response to COVID-19 and that there was no trade-off between public health and the economy.[35]
 The evidence presented here raises the question of whether The Conversation and other outlets that published similar pieces should disband, for the good of society.
 We now turn to the broader public engagement of Australian economists on the topic of COVID policy, in the form of op-eds in national print media, interviews in broadcast media, extensive coverage in national print media, and open letters. Table 2 presents a timeline of the major contributions made in these fora by Australian economists. We again categorise each contribution as �extremist�, ��ragmatist�, or ��inimalist� based on the severity of the restrictions for which the contributor(s) appeared to be advocating.[36]

While many dissident opinions were aired on Sky News, including by the authors, that channel was not incorporated within the search because the Australian branch of Sky News is not covered by Factiva.

 economists were represented, with one individual represented 10 times. While the large �������������������������������������essed in these public fora were in support of restrictions, by comparison to what was seen in the American economics community, we deem Australian economic analysis of COVID policy as portrayed in the mainstream media to have been relatively rich in real diversity.
 While the balance on display in �����������������������public media contributions was better than what we saw in professional surveys in other countries, in the sphere of social media, Australian economists who were offering extremist pieces to the public were derogatory towards others both in the profession and outside of it who publicly expressed different views.[39] These attacks took the place of reasoned and respectful discussion that might have led ultimately to better policy advice, and thereby prevented at least some of the damage done to the country.
 When Melbourne University VC Duncan Maskell put forward an anti-extremist viewpoint in The Age, Chris Edmond responded with the following tweet (4:54 PM, 20 September 2020):

 Coming straight after #qanda I got an invitation to the Economics Society of Australia virtual conference. Keynote speakers: two international speakers + Gigi Foster and Paul Frijters. ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������� ������������������������������������������������������������
 Quiggin also tweeted (8:23 PM, 26 March 2021):
 Gigi Foster was even against masks. I think the idea was some kind of herd thinning.

 A few brave economists called the authors of such social media posts to account. One such person was Rohan Pitchford, who in a heated exchange with Bruce Preston about the abuse delivered to those with different views, tweeted (May 14 2020):
 ������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� ����������������������������������������������������������������������������������� ons. Ad hominem.

 Similarly, Andreas Ortmann called Steven Hamilton up on his social media behaviour and this induced a public retraction ������������������������������������������������
 We view the tweets above by members of the extremist camp as inappropriate, a mortarboard-hat version of the dangerous proclamations made by members of a witch hunt or a crusade, and not merely unhealthy for the profession. This behaviour is likely to have stymied engagement by dissenters about the crucial economic policy decisions being made during this period, thereby directly damaging not only our profession but also Australia into the long term by preventing more sensible policy options from being aired and discussed openly.
 3.2 Recipes for a better future If one took the view that people should be held individually responsible for the actions they supported, then the demands of justice would be draconian for many Australian economists. Those who supported policies that violated human rights, were expected to destroy social welfare, and terrorised the domestic population � while in several cases also attempting to silence those with dissenting views � should lose their jobs and face retribution from the public that has been so damaged by their actions.[40]

###### In the case of groupthink-gone-wrong however, historical practice is not to enact justice through holding individuals responsible, but to openly recognise the mistakes of the collective and seek improvements in institutions to prevent a recurrence. We here briefly lay out four main proposals, which are more fully discussed in Frijters et al. (2021):
 1. The use of citizen juries to appoint people to the top posts of all government
 departments, large non-profit institutions that rely significantly on public funding (including universities and the public media), and all semi-independent public institutions. One citizen jury of 20 random citizens would be constructed per top job to be filled, with juries organised and supported administratively by the Australian Electoral Commission. A jury would decide its own terms for finding and appointing someone. Leaders of public institutions would still follow the directions of elected politicians, but the task of appointing them would be in the hands of citizen juries, not politicians or interest groups.
 2. Truth commissions at all levels, with independent commissions organised by
 professions, academic societies, and communities. 
 3. Ex-post taxation of all profits from political profiteering during this period, with an
 amnesty from criminal charges for those cooperating early in identifying the profiteering.
 4. An embrace of the reformative ideas of scientists, lawyers, doctors, and other
 professionals who spoke out against the groupthink throughout Australia.

 4 Conclusion In this paper we have documented how the lockdowns enacted in Australia and elsewhere were a disproportionate and largely ineffective policy response to COVID-19. These policies went against the advice contained explicitly and implicitly in prevailing textbooks, blueprints, codes of ethics, and scientific consensus of the previous decades, arguably violating the Nuremberg codes that demand a reasoned view that the cure is no worse than the disease. We have documented how, at the start, some top economists in state bureaucracies and academia in various countries had already calculated that the expected damage of the policies would far outweigh any reasonable estimate of what might be averted by lockdowns, with this advice often buried by governments or, at a minimum, ignored.
 The documented damage of the lockdowns was of an entirely different order and type than the losses that can reasonably be claimed to have been averted. The damage was severe for children of disadvantaged backgrounds across the world who witnessed severe disruptions to their education and development. There was mental health damage to those made lonely or idle, disrupted fertility treatments that prevented far more lives from being ��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������

 cost a multiple in years of life than can be claimed to have been saved, and on and on. The effects in poorer countries are several times worse, as the disruption to education, economic growth, and health services bite so much more in places with lower initial settings on all of these things. Estimates from six different teams across the Anglo-Saxon countries show how the costs to society as a whole, measured in terms of WELLBYs taken from the whole population, outweigh the benefits of lockdown by a ratio ranging between 4:1 to 1000:1, if there indeed are any actual benefits of lockdowns at all. These directly measured costs still omit any recognition of the losses from violations of human rights, increased authoritarian rule, the rise of mass surveillance, disrupted migration flows, and many other higher-level damages to our social norms.
 In contrast to some of the economists inside state institutions, the majority response of Australian academic and other �independent� economists in public sight was to fall in line with government policies, and produce papers, blogs, and op-eds that rationalised policies already decided upon using assumptions known to be wrong at the time and making basic mistakes regarding standard cost-benefit analysis. In vehicles that allowed for it, there was bullying of dissenters, an outright denial of basic tenets of economics that have been part of the established canon for centuries (like the existence of trade-offs), and a shirking of ethical responsibilities. The majority of Australian economists who became engaged in public commentary about the policies showed themselves to be part of the problem.
 As for solutions, we argue there is hope in the use of citizen juries for appointments to the top layer of the Australian public sector. This mechanism would reduce political interference in public media, public universities, government departments, statistical agencies, and many other institutions. It would help to embed more diversity into the public sector as a whole, meaning more vantage points from which to see what is going on. We also expect it to be hugely effective in countering widespread corruption and abuses of power.
 For the Australian economics profession and society as a whole, we think truth commissions are a reasonable way forward to recognise that crimes during this period have been aided and abetted by our profession, to acknowledge the domestic and international victims of those crimes, and to establish a more truthful basis from which to move on.

**_Foreword_**

I am pleased and proud to endorse the attached letter and monograph, meticulously compiled
by Dr Phillip Altman and his colleagues. They address some important aspects of COVID19
management and policy, especially in Australia, with a focus on the nature, deployment and
effects of “vaccines”. It is abundantly clear that there has been repression and suppression
in scientific circles and the media of any views or suggestions that run counter to the government/mainstream narrative. However, many studies now indicate that the Covid19 vaccines,
especially the mRNA vaccines, are less than 'safe and effective', and the ramifications are
truly confronting. Armed with these facts, the scientific and medical communities can now
begin proper discussions of potential solutions that improve the benefit/risk ratios for the public
and do not harm careers and livelihoods of professionals seeking the best outcomes for their
patients.

###### PART A: Background - COVID-19 Gene-Based ‘Vaccines’
 1. The Nature of the COVID-19 Gene-Based ‘Vaccines’

1.1. The nature of the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ has been largely misrepresented by
mainstream media, big pharmaceutical companies, and governments, and is
consequently poorly understood by the population at large. Most people consider
vaccines to be relatively safe and well researched and readily accept their widespread
use.

1.2. However, these COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ are not really vaccines – they are serious genebased therapies which employ a gene-based technology which has never before been
deployed in a fully approved therapeutic product. In this sense they should properly
be considered to be experimental, and much safety and efficacy information has been
gained since the introduction of these products more than a year ago.

1.3. COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ as a therapeutic fall under the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies’ definition of “gene therapy
products”, in that it involves “introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help
treat a disease”[1]. Despite this, the FDA did not evaluate this therapy in relation to the
established gene therapy guidelines. Gene therapies have never been widely used in
a general population.

###### 2. Regulatory Status of the COVID-19 Gene-Based ‘Vaccines’

2.1. On or about the following dates, the TGA granted conditional Provisional Approval of
the following gene-based ‘vaccines’:

    - COMIRNATY Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd – a mRNA vaccine (25 January 2021)

    - Pfizer paediatric vaccine has been Provisionally Approved (3 December 2021) 511 years

    - VAXZEVRIA AstraZeneca Pty Ltd – a viral vector vaccine (15 February 2021)

    - COVID-19 VACCINE Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd – a viral vector vaccine (25 June 2021)

    - SPIKEVAX Moderna Australia Pty Ltd, - a mRNA vaccine (9 August 2021)

    - Moderna paediatric vaccine has been Provisionally Approved (17 February 2022)
6-11 years & 6 month to 5 years (19 July 2022)

    - NUVAXOVID Novavax Inc. – a non-gene protein-based vaccine delivering spike
protein in a lipid-nanoparticle matrix carrier (19 January 2022)

2.2. The TGA receives technical and policy advice from the Australian Technical Advisory
Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). Members of ATAGI have both academic and clinical
interests in vaccine research. The TGA relies heavily upon the recommendations of
ATAGI in relation to the efficacy, safety and use of vaccines. Many government and

-----

private corporate entities rely, in many cases exclusively, upon the health policy advice
issued by ATAGI. The TGA also receives advice from the Advisory Committee on
Vaccines (ACV) in relation to safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines supplied in
Australia.

2.3. Provisional Approval is a relatively new drug regulatory pathway introduced into the
Therapeutic Goods Act in 2018. Under this expedited review system, therapeutic
agents (including vaccines) can be made available for use when there is a perceived
urgent need to use a drug even though the amount of ordinary safety and efficacy data
normally required to approve that drug is not available. The manufacturer is required
by the TGA to submit additional safety and efficacy data over a defined period to
answer specific important outstanding safety and efficacy issues not completed or
concluded before the product is Provisionally Approved. Products released under
“Provisional Approval” cannot be considered fully evaluated. Under these
circumstances and because there is pending or outstanding safety and efficacy data
to be generated and evaluated, it is premature to declare such drugs “safe and
effective”, and the use of these agents needs to be constantly under review in light of
emerging safety data to reassess the risk versus any perceived benefit.

2.4. The new generation COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ have not been fully ‘approved’ by the
Australian drug regulator – all these products have been “Provisionally Approved” due
to deficiencies in the normal scope and depth of safety and efficacy data normally
required for full approval. This is of particular importance in relation to vaccine
mandates in so far as the regulatory status of these products establish without any
doubt that important safety and efficacy concerns remain in relation to the use of these
products. In such circumstances, forcing individuals on a massive scale to receive
such serious medications with potentially unknown and serious adverse
consequences, including death, using coercive vaccination mandates, is without
precedence in medicine.

2.5. Conventional vaccines usually take about 7 years to develop and test. In a 2018
publication sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation[2], vaccines were
divided into three categories: simple, complex and unprecedented.

2.6. The unprecedented category represents those vaccines directed towards a disease
that has never before been successfully treated and include vaccines against HIV and
malaria. According to authors Seneff and Nigh[3] unprecedented vaccines are expected
to take more than 12 years to develop due to the technical difficulties, and they are
expected to have a very low chance (about 5%) of proving safety and efficacy in even
early Phase II clinical trials involving small numbers of individuals, and a very much
lower chance (about 2%) of moving to larger Phase III clinical trials and demonstrating
safety and efficacy before being considered for marketing. The gene-based COVID

19 ‘vaccines’ were developed in less than a year and are supported by abbreviated
safety and efficacy clinical data. These gene-based ‘vaccines’ are in the
‘unprecedented’ category.

2.7. Historically, a large number of conventional vaccines have been withdrawn due to
safety concerns following widespread use. These include vaccines for Yellow Fever,
polio, smallpox, Dengue fever, measles, respiratory syncytial virus, Swine flu,
rotavirus, papillomavirus and influenzae.

###### 3. How the Gene-Based COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’ Work

3.1. These ‘vaccines’ use a genetic technology which has not been employed for any fully
approved drug and in this sense the use of these products should properly be
considered experimental. This technology, due to its inherent safety risks, has
previously only been investigated in relatively early clinical research for possible use
in certain cancers and rare genetic disorders. These products deliver either RNA in a
lipo-nanoparticle (which has never been used previously) or DNA genetic material
contained in a viral vector to produce the spike protein, similar to that found on the
surface of the coronavirus, in order to provoke an immune response. It is the spike
protein which is now known to be the main toxic component of the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus. It is also the spike protein produced by these ‘vaccines’ which is
understood to cause the unprecedented number of serious adverse events and death
being reported following vaccination in various international adverse drug reporting
systems.

3.2. All COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ employ new generation nanoparticle technology: either nonviral or viral based nanoparticles[4]. The extremely small size of nanomaterials also
means that they are much more readily taken up by the human body than larger sized
particles. Nanomaterials are able to cross biological membranes and access cells,
tissues and organs that larger sized particles normally cannot[5]. Such wide and
efficient distribution following administration has significant implications in relation to
organ and tissue toxicity as compared to conventional vaccines which largely remain
at the site of injection. Specifically, nanoparticles may cross the blood-brain barrier
(the membrane protecting the spinal cord and brain) and they may be associated with
long term inflammation in various tissues and organs, and they may be associated
with cardiovascular adverse effects.[6]

###### 4. Threat Posed by SARS-CoV-2

4.1. The threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in producing the COVID-19 infection to
segments of the community has been exaggerated due to the nature of the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test used to detect “cases”. The PCR test as used in Australia
and elsewhere was set (cycle threshold value: “Ct”) to be exquisitely sensitive and
could produce a positive result even if no live virus was present or even if a fragment
of a single viral particle was present. A survey of the utility of PCR tests reported that
positive PCR tests set to a Ct of 35 only correlated with a positive culture in 3% of
cases[7]. In Australia and elsewhere, the PCR Ct was normally set at even higher values
conferring less reliability. The PCR test was never intended to be diagnostic for
COVID-19 due to this attribute. Individuals testing positive for COVID-19 frequently
have very low viral loads and are asymptomatic (show no symptoms) and are
incapable of transmission of the virus due to their low viral loads. Children, in
particular, are at virtually nil threat of serious COVID-19 infection (see below). Some
estimates suggest that up to 97% of COVID positive cases” detected by PCR detected
no virus on culture and therefore were of questionable value[8]. Indeed, so grave are
the many limitations and lack of reliability attributable to PCR tests, that external peer
review revealed 10 major scientific[9] flaws that resulted in strong calls for the
retraction[10] of the Corman-Drosten paper,[11] published by Eurosurveillance.

4.2. In recognition of the limitations of the PCR testing, these tests are no longer
considered generally appropriate by the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) in
determining the number of COVID-19 cases and their emergency use authorisation
has been withdrawn reflecting this fact[12].

4.3. COVID-19 government statistics represent another complicating factor. There is no
discrimination between those individuals in hospital or intensive care “dying with”
COVID-19 as opposed to ‘dying from’ COVID-19. Patients in hospital for serious nonCOVID-19 related illness are routinely tested for COVID-19 and often return a positive
test. These patients are routinely recorded as “COVID cases” and this can be
misleading.

The Time of Covid


-----

4.4. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics up to 15 February 2022[13] “There are
2,639 death registrations that have been received by the ABS where an individual is
certified as having died from or with COVID-19 between the start of the pandemic and
31 January 2022”. The median age for those who died from COVID-19 was 83.7 years
(81.2 years for males, 86.0 years for females) among individuals reasonably assumed
to have multiple serious co-morbidities. COVID-19 is an infection principally causing
more serious illness in older individuals.

4.5. Australian government Department of Health website: Coronavirus (COVID-19) case
_numbers and statistics (updated 7 May 2022) states there have been a total of_
6,165,105 “cases” of COVID-19[14]. This translates to a death rate of COVID-19 of
0.0428% (for those ‘dying with’ COVID-19). COVID-19 was only the 38[th] leading cause
of death in Australia reported in 2020 statistics. With the delta then Omicron waves
since late 2021, deaths with COVID-19 have risen, but data where it is available, as in
NSW, indicate that proportions of hospitalisations and deaths are as high or higher
among vaccinated than among unvaccinated people (see 13.11 below).

4.6. The NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report ending 23 July 2022 states: ‘146 COVID_19 deaths were reported this week, a 3% increase from 142 reported last week. All_
_146 deaths were eligible for a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine…..’, indicating that there_
were no deaths reported for unvaccinated individuals[15].

4.7. To place these numbers in perspective, the number of deaths due to influenza reported
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics increased steadily from 68 in 2011 to 274 in
2016, and rose sharply to 1,183 in 2017[16]. When grouped, influenza and pneumonia
contributed to 4,369 deaths in 2017 and were the ninth leading cause of death for the
year. During 2018, influenza and pneumonia were the twelfth leading cause of death
(n = 3,102 deaths).

4.8. No statistic is available regarding the number of Australians ‘dying from’ COVID-19.
The total number of Australians ‘dying from’ COVID-19 would be some fraction of the
total deaths reported. Officially reported ‘COVID-19 deaths’ do not discriminate
between those dying “with” COVID-19 and those dying “due to” COVID-19. Some
government websites make this clear[17].

4.9. The impact of COVID-19 varies depending on the age group. There is no Australian
statistic available to demonstrate that any otherwise healthy child died ‘due to’ or ‘from’
COVID-19.

4.10. The lack of information on the actual cause of death in children in these rare instances
makes any assessment of the risk of death due to COVID-19 in this age group tenuous.
The risk of death due to COVID-19 may range from exceedingly rare to virtually and
statistically nil.

4.11. There is emerging evidence that the COVID-19 gene-based ‘vaccines’ are showing
rapid and significant diminished efficacy against the Omicron variant, particularly in
children aged 5-11.[18]

4.12. Some useful information regarding COVID-19 ascribed deaths in the UK was obtained
by a Freedom of Information Request (FOI/2021/3368), showing the number of deaths
where COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate, from 1
February 2020 to 31 December 2021, by sex and age group in England and Wales[19].
This data (presented below as a downloaded Excel table) is important because it is a
record where COVID-19 is the only listed possible cause of death, and it covers a
period where the most virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the global
population.

4.14. Another study in children and young people (<18 years of age) in the UK covering
12,023,568 individuals, from March 2020 to February 2021, examined the records of
3,105 who died including 61 who were positive for SARS-CoV-2[20].

4.15. This study is instructive, in that it describes in detail an evaluation process which
should normally be conducted in evaluating whether or not an individual’s death can
be ascribed to COVID-19, in light of pre-existing co-morbidities. Many reports of
“COVID deaths” do not attempt to discriminate or ascribe causality to this level, and
therefore are of limited usefulness. This study was done at a time when the more
virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant, and it could be assumed to significantly
overstate the risk of death due to the current Omicron variant which has been dominant
during 2022 worldwide[21].

4.16. Despite the potential for this study to overestimate the risk of death in 2022, the authors
conclude:

_“…the risk of serious outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 for individuals under 18 years of_
_age remains extremely low” - and even considering child deaths where COVID-19 was_
not the sole cause, the authors conclude – _“we estimated the infection fatality rate to_
_be five per 100,000 indicating that more than 99.995% of children and young people_
_recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection.”_

###### 5. Initial Perceptions of the COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’

5.1. Initially, despite limited clinical and epidemiological data, a number of community and
health professional perceptions were widely held in relation to these new vaccines
including:

    - the vaccines prevent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent
COVID-19 developing (COVID-19 being the disease caused by the virus)

    - the vaccines prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from infected to
non-infected individuals

    - the vaccines would provide durable immunity

    - the vaccines are 95% effective

    - the vaccines are safe and effective

5.2. In light of more than a year of widespread COVID-19 vaccination usage all these initial
perceptions have been shown to be without foundation. It is undisputed that COVID

19 is commonplace in fully vaccinated individuals and now multiple boosters are being
recommended at relatively frequent intervals. The current COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ have
lost effectiveness against the emerging variants – to many, they have failed. However,
the incidence of serious adverse events from these gene-based ‘vaccines’ continue to
be reported and continue to rise in unprecedented number and severity.[22]

5.3. A good example of the popular misconceptions concerning the gene-based COVID19 ‘vaccines’ is the claim of 95% efficacy which was repeated and unchallenged in the
mainstream media and by health authorities in Australia and elsewhere.

5.4. Approval of the gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ were based on single clinical trials
from each company. These single trials were the sole basis for both the safety and
efficacy claims. For example, in the case of the Pfizer gene-based ‘vaccine’ it was
widely stated and generally accepted at the time that the clinical efficacy of the vaccine
was determined in a large clinical trial of about 44,000 subjects and the efficacy was
95%.

5.5. Without an understanding of the design, conduct and reporting of clinical trials, the
ordinary person might interpret this statement in a number of different ways. For
example, this “95%” efficacy might be interpreted to mean that vaccination provides a
95% chance of being protected from being infected following exposure from a person
infected with SARS-CoV-2; or it might be interpreted to mean that vaccination reduces
the risk of the average healthy person falling seriously ill and needing hospitalisation
following SARS-CoV-2 infection; or it might be interpreted as showing the risk of death
due to severe COVID-19 illness is reduced by 95%.

5.6. Indeed, none of these interpretations are correct.

5.7. The claimed 95% efficacy was based upon only 170 subjects who contracted COVID19 during the trial which had a median follow up of two months post-second dose. The
claimed clinical efficacy was not based upon 44,000 subjects. Of the 44,000 subjects
enrolled and divided roughly equally between receiving active prophylactic vaccination
or placebo, only 170 subjects tested positive for COVID-19 AND developed even mild
COVID-19 symptoms (similar to the common cold) which was the criterion set for
“clinical efficacy”; with eight testing positive in the vaccinated group AND displaying a
COVID-19 symptom as mild as a sore throat, fever or cough, while 162 tested positive
in the placebo group AND displayed a COVID-19 symptom as mild as a sore throat,
fever or cough. This is where the 95% COVID “vaccine” efficacy claim originated and,
based on this pivotal data, it should not be inferred that the Pfizer COVID-19 “vaccine
was shown to be 95% effective in preventing serious COVID-19 disease, symptoms,
hospitalisation or death”[23].

5.8. The Pfizer trial (mentioned above) reported 99.07% of unvaccinated individuals did not
develop symptoms of COVID-19 while 99.95% the vaccinated group did not report
COVID-19 symptoms thus producing an absolute risk reduction of symptoms of 0.88%.
This statistic is a realistic measure of protection from COVID-19 (which may only
present as mild symptoms) in an uninfected population over the trial surveillance
period.

5.9. A subsequent Pfizer COMIRNATY gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ trial which was
pivotal in the approval of this ‘vaccine’ for children 5-11 relied on the clinical symptoms
of only 19 children (3 developed symptoms in the Comirnaty vaccine group and 16 in
the placebo group) upon which to base its claimed a relative clinical efficacy of
90.7%.[24] Once again, the claimed clinical efficacy only referred to the chance of
preventing the mild symptoms, similar to the common cold, in children who tested
positive for COVID-19. The absolute vaccine clinical efficacy to prevent even mild
symptoms among the 4500 trial participants can then be calculated to be under 1%.

5.10. A similar approach was adopted by other manufacturers such as Moderna claiming
similar “efficacy” which has not been understood by either the media or the lay public.

###### 6. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children

6.1. All therapeutic agents, including vaccines, present a safety risk. Therefore, the riskbenefit analysis of any medication needs to be weighed up.

6.2. Drug regulatory agencies now recognise that most children with COVID-19 have either
no symptoms (asymptomatic) or have only mild symptoms.

6.3. I have searched without success for evidence and statistics for the incidence of severe
COVID-19 and death due principally to COVID-19 in children aged 5-11 in New
Zealand and Australia.

6.4. Some information appears in the Australian TGA AusPAR (Public Assessment Report)
Pfizer mRNA Vaccine COMIRNATY dated December 2021, which was used to
approve the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5-11 years of age. On page 11 of
this Australian report, Table 1 (below) includes COVID-19 “cases” in Australia by age

numbers of children in age group 0-4 and 5-11 are presented. It reports that over more
than a nine month period in 2021 (at a time that the more virulent stains of SARS-CoV2 were prevalent) that one person under 18 years of age died either “with” or “due to”
COVID-19.

**Table 1: COVID-19 “cases” in Australia by age group and highest level of illness**

6.5. A search of the Risk Management Plan report released by Pfizer in February 2022
reviewed all available US COVID-19 cases and deaths to 14 August 2021. The
incident of death in children who tested positive to COVID-19 in ages 0-4 and 5-11
years was listed as “<0.1%” for each group[25]. This statistic, once again, does not
distinguish between those children dying “with” COVID-19 or “due to” COVID-19.

6.6. The above data sets are consistent with studies[26] showing the mortality rate in children
hospitalised with COVID-19 of less than 0.18%, which is less than the mortality rate

seen in children from seasonal influenza.[27] These figures correlate with further findings
showing 46.7% of children 0 to 18 years [28] being asymptomatic upon infection.

###### PART B: Emerging Picture of the Safety and Efficacy of the COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’
 7. Failure to Demonstrate a Favourable Risk/Benefit Case for Vaccinating Children with COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’

7.1. Table 1 above, shows that no children died and 4 aged 5-11 were admitted to Intensive
Care Units (ICU), however, as indicated previously in this report, it is important to
distinguish between those children admitted to ICU “from COVID-19” or “with COVID19”. It is possible that at least some of these children were admitted for serious comorbidities (as often is the case), but coincidentally tested positive for COVID-19. Until
this reasonable possibility is ruled out, this information should not be relied upon as
evidence that children suffer, to any meaningful extent, serious disease caused by
COVID-19.

7.2. In reality, the risk of COVID-19 death in an otherwise healthy 5-11 year-old is virtually
or statistically nil. Investigations of extremely rare cases have been poorly
characterised, and it is unclear to what extent any reported death is directly attributable
to COVID-19 as opposed to pre-existing medical conditions. A Johns Hopkins study
published in July 2021 monitoring 48,000 children diagnosed with COVID-19 found a
mortality rate of zero among children without a pre-existing medical condition.[29]

7.3. As COVID-19 is now known to rarely produce serious disease in children, this should
have significant impact upon the risk-benefit analysis of using the gene-based
‘vaccines’ which have known serious short-term serious adverse effects, including
death, and potentially serious unknown longer term adverse effects in this age group.

8.1. Very limited relatively short-term safety data is available from the individuals involved
in the controlled clinical trials submitted to drug regulatory agencies in support of the

emergency authorisations or provisional approvals of the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’. As
such, there is a heavy reliance upon post-marketing adverse drug reaction report
(ADR) systems to identify the type and incidence of adverse effects which are caused
by the ‘vaccines’. There are a number of such systems. Australia has the Drug
Adverse Event Reporting system (DAEN), and the US has the Vaccine Adverse
Events Reporting System (VAERS) which reports both US and international adverse
events.

8.2. The problem with these systems is that they involve voluntary reporting and most
doctors are reluctant to report adverse drug reactions to vaccines due to fear of being
accused by health regulators (Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Agency,
AHPRA) of being considered to be “anti-vax”.[30] Many doctors both here and overseas
and other health professionals fear losing their licence to practice if they even apply
for vaccine exemptions, and many investigations are currently underway by AHPRA
at the present time. Also, the criteria for assessing a causal relationship between a
vaccine and an adverse event can be set so high that only a small percentage of
serious adverse events or deaths are officially reported as being caused by a vaccine.
These are some of the reasons why it is widely acknowledged all adverse event
reporting systems suffer from notorious underreporting[31]. This can result in an
underreporting factor of between 10-30 or more, i.e.: one must multiply the official
incidence of adverse events by 10-30, to obtain a real-world estimate of the true
incidence of the adverse event. For US VAERS reporting in respect of the Covid-19
‘vaccines’, the underreporting factor (URF) is estimated to be between 40x-49x[32].

8.3. In Australia, it is difficult to obtain statistics regarding details of the number of deaths
caused by the gene-based ‘vaccines’. A Freedom of Information request (FOI-3586)
was made to the TGA for data on the deaths reported as possibly related to the
COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ and the 196-page report is available online but is almost
completely redacted.[33] In the US the VAERS adverse drug reporting system has
recorded 27,758 deaths associated with gene-based “vaccine” administration through
to 29 April 2022. The TGA COVID-19 vaccine weekly safety report released 23 June
2022[34] indicates a total of 889 deaths in association with COVID-19 gene-based
‘vaccines’ of which only 13 have been identified by the TGA as definitely causing
death. However, there are no public details available as to the criteria used by the
TGA in arriving at this number of 13 deaths. This reported incidence of death does
not account for any underreporting factor.

8.4. Further confounding a proper of assessment of reported deaths is the complete lack
of guidance or directions from the TGA or State or Territory health departments, with
respect to any requirement to conduct autopsies on persons dying at any time post
COVID-19 vaccination. This is an unfortunate state of affairs when it is known to the
TGA as a consequence of its Pharmacovigilance duties, that by employing new
histopathological methods developed in Germany, that identify the mRNA generated
spike proteins at the scene of fatal pathological inflammatory reactions, deaths that
could be easily attributed to a 'normal' heart attack, or a 'normal' stroke, are now
instead being found to have been caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Critically, in the
German studies, of the 15 deceased examined, deaths due to the vaccines were found
to be 'likely' and 'very likely' in 80% of cases.[35]

8.5. Prior to COVID-19 vaccinations, over the last 10 years there has been an average of
about 155 deaths per year reported in relation to all conventional vaccines to the US
VAERS. This includes all standard childhood vaccines on vaccine schedules, annual
flu vaccines, travel vaccines, hepatitis, human papilloma virus vaccines, tetanus
vaccines, meningococcal vaccines and herpes vaccines.

8.6. The website OpenVAERS extracts VAERS data each week specifically in relation to
adverse event reports for the Covid-19 ‘vaccines’. An inspection shows the contrast
in reported mortality for the gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ compared to all other
vaccines combined since 1990.[36]

8.7. Statistics on the number of flu vaccines administered over many years is provided by
the US CDC[37], and range from about 110 million per year to more than 190 million per
year since 2008. Similarly, there have been more people who have received
measles/mumps/Rubella vaccinations (301,000,000) than COVID-19 vaccinations
(255,000,000) since VAERS commenced reporting in 1990[38].

8.8. The relatively high number of adverse reports received by the VAERS (hosted by the
US CDC) relative to other commonly used vaccines, is also seen in both of the other
two major adverse drug reporting systems: VigiAccess (hosted by WHO) and
EudraVigilance (hosted by the European Medicines Agency)[39].

8.9. Dr. Jessica Rose, specialist data analyst, has focused her attention on the US VAERS
data and published on the general ADR data as well as specifically in relation to

8.10. As of 22 April 2022, in the United States alone there had been recorded 5,309 cases
of myocarditis, 782,665 adverse events, 151,796 severe adverse events, and 14,613
deaths in VAERS following COVID-19 vaccination.[41] Every adverse drug reaction
report needs to be individually assessed to rate the probability of causing any particular
adverse reaction – not all reports are assessed as “causal”. On the other hand, the
underreporting factor can range from 5 to perhaps as high as 31 times[42] or more.

8.11. The confounding assessment factors of underreporting of adverse effects on one
hand, and the possible lack of evidence of causation on the other hand in relation to
deaths caused by vaccines, can be resolved to a large degree by an examination of
the statistics of death temporally associated with vaccine administration.

8.12. Dr. Jessica Rose has analysed the percentage of individuals experiencing adverse
effects within 24- and 48-hour periods in relation to COVID-19 vaccine administration.

8.13. Of particular interest is the Rose analysis of VAERS % reported deaths following
vaccination with the gene-based vaccines versus the number of days following
injection[43]. This analysis included a graphical representation of the temporal
relationship between the number of deaths reported in association with COVID-19
vaccine administration and the time of death measured in days following injection.

In relation to the widely accepted Bradford Hill criteria for the assessment of adverse
drug reactions, a close temporal relationship between drug administration and the
adverse event represents some of the strongest evidence upon which to assign a
cause-effect relationship.

The following graphical representation depicts the percent of reported deaths versus
the number of days following injection of a COVID-19 “vaccine” (data ending
December 2021) showing a clustering of deaths within about 2 days of administration
(orange line) compared to an expected background incidence of a hypothetical event
which is not related temporally to vaccine administration (yellow line).

Further evidence to support the cause-effect relationship between death and COVID-19
“vaccine” administration may be seen by comparing the similar characteristic temporal
relationship between anaphylaxis and reported deaths. In this respect, anaphylaxis is
used as a positive control to assist the interpretation of the data.

19

The Time of Covid


-----

Another important temporal relationship extracted from the VAERS data is shown below
between the incidence of myocarditis and COVID-19 “vaccine” administration.

8.14. The abovementioned analyses are short-term analyses, i.e. observations within days,
weeks or months of vaccination. No long-term safety data is available for the COVID19 gene-based vaccines. The long-term safety of the gene-based vaccines is
completely unknown and there are potentially serious concerns which will only be
resolved many years into the future. These concerns are based on the identification
of pathogenic attributes of the spike protein and include profound disturbances in
regulatory control of protein synthesis and natural cancer surveillance protective
mechanisms, a potentially causal link to neurodegenerative disease, immune
thrombocytopenia, Bell’s palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired
DNA damage response and tumorigenesis.

8.15. It has been suggested that the increase in deaths temporally associated with the
introduction of the gene-based ‘vaccines’ is not due to these new ‘vaccines’ but rather
due to increased numbers of injections overall. However, this explanation does not
appear valid as the COVID-19 vaccines represent a small proportion of all vaccines
given in the US since 1990. For example, just considering flu vaccines, it has been
reported that since the 08/09 flu season a total of 1,720,400,000 flu vaccines were
administered while only 557,637,223 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines were
administered in the USA. Many other types of vaccines are routinely used.

8.16. A detailed summary and analysis of the adverse drug reactions reported in association
with the COVID-19 gene-based “vaccines” is presented as an addendum to this
Report[44]

**Focus on Myocarditis and Pericarditis**

8.17. Of all the serious more short-term adverse events receiving attention in relation to the
gene-based COVID-19 vaccines, myocarditis has probably received the most attention
due to the seriousness of the condition (can cause permanent heart damage and be
fatal) and its potential to affect longevity especially in the younger age groups with a
predominance among younger males.

8.18. In analysing the possible incidence of myocarditis associated with the gene-based
vaccines, it is useful to compare the historical rates of myocarditis prior to the
introduction of these vaccines with the rate associated with the vaccine rollouts (Pfizer,
Moderna and Janssen) during 2021[45].

8.19. It appears that there is a risk of myocarditis from both COVID-19 infection (especially
in the elderly population) and from gene-based COVID-19 vaccines – both considered
to be related to the toxic spike protein. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) has
attempted to discriminate between the two causal factors in order to arrive at a risk of
myocarditis caused by the vaccines. If there is a risk of people contracting myocarditis
from SARS-CoV-2 then this would appear to be negligible, as no health authority has
produced a report or meaningful evidence that SARS-CoV-2 significantly elevates the
risk of myocarditis.

8.20. The risk of myocarditis, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias associated with several
gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ or SARS-CoV-2 infection itself was studied in a large
case series study of people aged 16 or older in England between 1 December 2020
and 24 August 2021.[46]

8.21. In this large study the temporal relationship between the gene-based vaccines and
myocarditis was seen in the subgroup analysis by age showing an increased risk of
myocarditis associated with the two mRNA vaccines in those younger than 40 years
of age. Subgroup analysis was only performed for myocarditis. While those under 16
years of age were not studied it is widely recognised and accepted that younger males
are most at risk of myocarditis. In addition, the authors state:

_‘Our findings are relevant to the public, clinicians and policy makers. First, there was_
_an increase in the risk of myocarditis within a week of receiving the first dose of both_

_adenovirus and mRNA vaccines, and a higher increased risk after the second dose of_
_both mRNA vaccines.’_

_‘Myocarditis is underdiagnosed in practice, with clinical bias being directed towards_
_myocardial ischemia or infarction.’_

8.22. In a nationwide study in France involving 32 million people aged 12-50 years of age
and receiving 46 million doses of mRNA vaccines, 1,612 cases of myocarditis and
1,613 cases of pericarditis occurred in France between 12 May 2021 and 31 October
2021.[47] The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for both the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines was found to be increased both after the first and second doses.
The risk of this association was statistically significant and particularly evident for the
Moderna COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ where the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis was increased
30 times suggesting a dose-response relationship, given Moderna has 100
micrograms of mRNA and COMIRNATY has 30 micrograms of mRNA per dose. The
risk was increased in younger age groups. The incidence of both myocarditis and
pericarditis reported in this study was consistent with the incidence reported in other
countries.

8.23. Another study from Israel investigated the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in
post COVID-19 unvaccinated patients.[48] This is an important study because some
have argued that the myocarditis and pericarditis incidence observed in populations
may be due to COVID-19 and not due to COVID-19 ‘vaccines’.  This retrospective
cohort study of 196,992 adults following COVID-19 infection and 590,976 control
adults who tested negative for COVID-19 concluded:

_‘Post COVID-19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis._
_We did not observe an increased incidence of either pericarditis nor myocarditis in_
_adult patients recovering from COVID-19 infection.’_

8.24. Aside from being under-diagnosed in practice, it is generally known that many doctors
avoid reporting myocarditis and other serious possible adverse events in relation to
the gene-based vaccines for fear of being seen as critical of the national health COVID19 vaccination policies, and possible health regulator intimidation and retribution. This,
combined with the inherent underreporting of adverse events in general, suggest the
true incidence of adverse effects such as myocarditis may be much higher than
officially reported. This needs to be considered in the calculation of the risk-benefit
analysis.

8.25. This is most recently outlined in an Australian Government report on _Guidance on_
_Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines dated 29 April 2022_ –

    - Case no. 734187 10 May 5-year-old male – abdominal pain, cardiac arrest.

8.27. Myocarditis and pericarditis are serious medical conditions which may have life-long
consequences and may be life threatening and may affect 5-11 year-old children. As
of 28-7-2022, despite possibly significant underreporting, there have been 37
suspected cases of chest pain (indicative of myocarditis and pericarditis) have been
reported to the DAEN system in this age group[51].

8.28. The paediatric COVID-19 gene-based ‘vaccines’ have only been available for a limited
time as compared to the vaccines for the older age groups. But the safety record of
the ‘vaccines’ used in the older age groups is an indicator of the adverse events one
might expect in the younger age groups.

8.29. In this regard, the following information should be taken into consideration:

a. The VAERS database reports that as of 22 April 2022, in the US alone there
were 5,309 cases of myocarditis, 782,665 adverse events, 151,796 severe
adverse events, and 14,613 deaths recorded following COVID-19 vaccination
in the US.[52]

b. After introduction of the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines in the US, VAERS
quickly accumulated an unusually large number of adverse events. Between
November 3 and December 19, 2021, VAERS received an overwhelming 4,249
adverse reaction reports for children aged five through eleven years who
received the Pfizer COVID-19 COMIRNATY ‘vaccine’[.][53]

8.30. Further, in the documents related to a recent FOIA request, in the Pfizer informed
consent document[54] it was revealed that the company recognised the risk of
myocarditis to be as high as 1 in 1,000. Myocarditis is overwhelmingly found in
younger people.

**Other Safety Factors and Issues to Consider**

8.31. Another factor which needs to be considered is the delay in assessing and reporting
adverse drug events due to the unprecedented number of such events being reported.
Pfizer itself has acknowledged this issue in its cumulative analysis of postauthorisation adverse event report 5.3.6 of pf-07302048 (bnt162b2), dated 30 April
2021 (Pfizer’s Adverse Events Report) (released in or about November 2021

Act):[55]

_“Pfizer has also taken multiple actions to help alleviate the large increase of adverse_
_event reports. This includes significant technology enhancements, and process and_
_workflow solutions, as well as increasing the number of data entry and case processing_
_colleagues. To date, Pfizer has onboarded approximately 600 additional fulltime_
_employees (FTEs). More are joining each month with an expected total of more than_
_1,800 additional resources by the end of June 2021.”[56]_

8.32. During phase III clinical trials for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine products, safety was
assessed based on a maximum observation period of 6 months. This is not adequate
to assess long-term safety outcomes. A typical timeline of up to 10 years would be
considered appropriate for long-term follow up. There are many examples where
biological products have been recalled (let alone gene-based products) such as the
rotavirus vaccines in 2010, the H1N1 influenza vaccine in 2009 and a meningococcal
vaccine in 2005-2008.

8.33. Data from pivotal clinical trials used to support the gene-based ‘vaccines’ of Moderna,
Pfizer and Janssen were re-analysed by Classen[57] to determine ‘all cause severe
_morbidity” defined as “severe infections with COVID-19 and all other severe adverse_
_events between the treatment arms and control arms respectively’. This type of_
analysis avoids any bias within the adverse drug reporting system where a causeeffect assessment might be arbitrarily discounted due to the overly strict criteria
required to establish such a relationship. This analysis found a statistically significant
increase in all cause severe morbidity in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo
group. When all types of severe events were considered, the vaccinated group
suffered more severe adverse events; this suggests the gene-based vaccines are
doing more harm than good.

8.34. In a published paper by a world-expert analyst of the VAERS database for all age
groups, Dr. Jessica Rose[58] found that, based on the ratio of expected severe adverse
events to observed adverse events in VAERS for a number of conditions, the
‘underreporting factor (URF)’ for COVID vaccine-associated deaths was 31. Using this
URF for all VAERS-classified severe adverse events, as of October 2021, COVID-19
‘vaccines’ were associated with 205,809 deaths, 818,462 hospitalizations, 1,830,891

8.35. Further relevant background information is provided by life insurance industry data for
adults. These data suggest historic increases in death claims coinciding with genebased ‘vaccine’ rollouts. A publicly available quarterly report by the Group Life
Insurance Industry, covering roughly 90% of the employer-based policies in the US,
reported that younger age groups were suddenly dying at historically unprecedented
rates beginning in Q3 of 2021.[59]

8.36. Other evidence of the damage caused by the gene-based ‘vaccines’ comes from the
number of ambulance calls in response to cardiac arrests and acute coronary
syndromes (heart attacks) for young people in the 16–39 age group during the COVID19 vaccination rollout in Israel (January–May, 2021) compared with the same period
of time in prior years 2019 and 2020.[60]

8.37. There is also an alarming and massive rise in deaths among healthy, young
professional athletes from around the world since the COVID-19 vaccination campaign
was initiated. As of 4 June 2022, approximately 1,090 athletes[61] suffered a cardiac
arrest, with 715 of them dying as a result. The majority of arrests occurred in
competition or training. The frequency of these events in comparison to historical data
is of great concern. In a 2009 review of professional athletes’ deaths[62], published in a
prominent European Cardiology journal, they found that from 1966 to 2004, there was
an average of only 29 sudden athlete deaths per year worldwide. Compare this
number to just the month of January 2022 alone where 127 collapses and 87 deaths
among professional athletes were reported. Overall, these athlete deaths reflect an
approximately 22-fold increase in the year after the introduction of COVID vaccines,
to date unexplained by other identifiable causes.

8.38. Australian Bureau of Statistics data also reflect a similar surge in Excess Deaths
commensurate with the rollout of the ‘vaccines’, where Excess (non-COVID) Deaths
for 2022 already are 17.5% above baseline, as the following graph[63] vividly depicts.

###### 8.39. New South Wales COVID-19 data for hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths
in the 14 days up to 23 July 2022[64] is shown below. The data shows 693 people with
known vaccination status were admitted to hospital; of these, one person was reported
as unvaccinated. In interpreting this data it is noted that this is at a time when it is
estimated that about 95% of individuals over 16 years of age are reported to be
vaccinated. Also, unvaccinated individuals entering hospital for any reason may be
more likely to be tested for COVID-19 as compared to those individuals who declare
they are vaccinated. Taking these factors into account, the data suggests that Covid19 vaccinated individuals are placing relatively higher demands on hospital resources
as compared to the unvaccinated, a trend that has been occurring in 2022.

8.40. One category of death not normally accounted for in Excess Deaths figures are
stillbirths. After the deployment of COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ in Germany and Scotland,
statistically significant increases in stillbirths, perinatal, and neonatal deaths are now
apparent from late 2021 leading into 2022[65].

8.41. Correspondingly, extraordinarily high drops in birth rates are now apparent in Germany
and Taiwan, with an over 10% decline[66] in the former, and an over 25% decline[67] in
the latter. Similar declines in birth rates are now also being seen across US states[68],
Sweden[69], Canada[70], and highly COVID-19 vaccinated Hungary.[71]

8.42. These declines appear to correlate with data released by Pfizer to regulators on or
shortly after 28 February 2021[72], where Pfizer reported on outcomes in 270 pregnant
women who received the Pfizer ‘vaccine’. No outcome or follow-up by Pfizer was
provided for 238 of the pregnancies thus undermining any claims of safety in
pregnancy. Of the remaining pregnancies 28 out of 29 babies died, a death rate of
97% in those pregnancies Pfizer did follow-up. Though this Pfizer pregnancy data is
grossly lacking, it nonetheless begs critical questions which regulators have to date
not asked. Regulators should begin asking questions or considering the continued
use of these ‘vaccines’, particularly now when further studies are confirming relatively
high impacts on women’s menstrual cycles[73]. Furthermore, data[74]procured from Pfizer
under Court order show that the Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) used as the delivery
vehicle for the synthetic mRNA, extensively bio-distributes throughout the human body
and accumulates in various organs including the kidney, spleen, adrenal glands, testes
and ovaries although ‘vaccine’ recipients were initially informed the ‘vaccines’ would
remain in the deltoid muscle at the site of injection. Although the effects of the
delivered synthetic mRNA upon the various organs studied is currently unknown, many
studies[75] show toxic effects of LNPs.

8.43. Collectively, the available peer-reviewed literature points to a number of serious safety
concerns regarding COVID-19 ‘vaccines’. Already by December 2021, in excess of
1,000 peer-reviewed articles and studies focussing upon post-vaccination deaths and
injuries had been published[76].

8.44. The long-term potential for the Spike Protein (produced by the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’)
to induce a range of autoimmune diseases has been commented upon by several
authors. Because there is no long-term safety data available at the moment, the
chance of induced autoimmune disease cannot be determined[77].

###### 9. Potential Toxicity of the Spike Protein Produced by Gene-Based ‘Vaccines’

9.1. The Spike Protein contained on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus facilitates the
binding of the viral particle to human cells, allowing infection of those cells, and has
inherent toxicity in its own right.[78] However, the Spike Proteins produced by the
COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ are not identical to the Spike Protein on the natural SARS-CoV2 virus[79] in that some uracil nucleotide bases (there are 4 different nucleotide bases in
RNA: uridine, cytosine, guanine and adenine) are replaced with pseudouridine (a
methylated derivative). This seemingly small change imparts profound
pharmacological characteristics to the mRNA molecule produced by the COVID-19
‘vaccines’ including the ability to evade natural degradation as happens to natural
mRNA. Further, the synthetic mRNA Spike Proteins interfere with the body’s natural
immune system (including Toll Like Receptors) which explains why these mRNA
particles can provoke latent viral eruptions of Herpes Zoster and Epstein-Barr viruses
as reported in adverse drug reaction reporting systems.

9.2. Reactivation of the dormant virus Herpes Zoster, which is responsible for shingles, has
been reported in relation to COVID-19 vaccination but at the moment no cause-andeffect relationship has been acknowledged. In order to investigate a possible causeeffect relationship, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken[80]. A total of
54 cases reported in the literature were found and reviewed. Thirty-six patients out of
45 (80%) developed herpes zoster following the priming dose of mRNA COVID-19
vaccine. Furthermore, 96% of patients developed it within a temporal timeframe
defined by WHO as indicative of a causal relationship. The authors even suggested
possible use of prophylactic herpes zoster anti-viral medication prior to vaccination to
herpes prone individuals.

9.3. Multiple modes of Spike Protein toxicity have been reported including those related to
blood clotting and mitochondrial damage[81].

9.4. It has been a widespread belief that the Spike Protein produced by the gene-based
‘vaccines’ is the same as the Spike Protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
therefore, the effects of both will be similar. Furthermore, it has been assumed that
exposing an individual to just the Spike Protein of the ‘vaccines’ is safer than exposure
to the natural virus. However, these reasonings are now being questioned. It is now
understood that the mRNA produced by the gene-based ‘vaccines’ contains pseudouridine instead of uridine as a nucleotide base and remains in circulation for much
longer.

###### 10. mRNA Does Not Remain at the Injection Site and Is Not Rapidly Destroyed

10.1. The normal biochemical protective mechanisms ensure that mRNA molecules are
normally rapidly destroyed outside cells. Initially, it was thought that mRNA produced
from COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ would be rapidly destroyed. However, evidence now shows
that the mRNA from these ‘vaccines’ may linger for 15 days or more post-vaccination[82].
The persistence of this mRNA has implications for continued production of Spike
Protein and associated possible toxicity associated with the Spike Protein. Another
study suggests mRNA produced following COVID-19 vaccination may remain in lymph
nodes for up to 60 days[83].

10.2. These nucleotide manipulations of the ‘vaccine’ mRNAs to reduce its rate of
degradation and therefore to enhance its capacity to drive Spike Protein production
per molecule of mRNA, may produce concentrations much higher than those observed
with natural infection in some individuals. Gene-based ‘vaccines’ appear to drive
production of incredibly high numbers of Spike Protein mRNA molecules (13 trillion to
40 trillion) almost instantaneously as compared to natural infection. This may account
for the serious adverse effects and deaths reported following administration of genebased COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ in adverse drug reporting systems, and further research
is needed with regard to this important observation.

10.3. The immediate injection of literally trillions of Spike Protein producing mRNA
molecules, as distinct from the slower accumulation of Spike Protein by natural
infection, could be responsible for the numbers of deaths reported within 48 hours of
COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ injection, although this is yet to be proven. This is why COVID-19

‘vaccine’ related deaths need to be thoroughly investigated, with autopsies that include
determination of tissue levels of Spike Protein.

10.4. These authors also reflect upon the lack of transparency regarding lot-to-lot gene
sequencing for vaccine quality control which might explain why some batches/lots of
gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ are associated with much high incidences of severe
adverse effects[84].

10.5. A biopsy study provided direct evidence linking Spike Protein concentrations produced
following vaccination in heart tissue to the development of myocarditis.[85]

**11.** **Long-Term Potential Genetic Damage and Cancer Potential of COVID-19**
###### ‘Vaccines’

11.1. In considering the safety of any new therapeutic, potential for both genotoxicity
(damage to genes) and mutagenicity (potential to cause cancer) are among the
highest priorities. This should especially apply to genetic therapeutics such as the
COVID-19 ‘vaccines’, and more so when administration of these products to healthy
individuals of all ages worldwide was envisioned.

11.2. Evidence shows the spike protein produced by the Pfizer mRNA vaccine can enter
into the nucleus of cells and disrupt fundamental cellular processes involved in DNA
repair. This adds to concerns and raises serious potential safety issues regarding a
diminished ability of the body to prevent the rise of cancers[86]. Neither of these
observed genetic type molecular effects are expected in relation to conventional
vaccines.

11.3. The gene-based COVID-19 ’vaccine’ manufacturers presented their products as
‘vaccines’ to drug regulators even though, by their very nature, they were a new class
of gene-based therapies. This had significant impact on reducing the usual safety
testing requirements which were normally applied to gene-based therapies. It should
be noted that in order to assist and accommodate the introduction of these
experimental drugs, the CDC and other organisations began applying recently reduced
safety data requirements applicable to conventional vaccines to these gene-based
‘vaccines’ and the definition of ‘vaccine’ was amended to accommodate these new
gene-based therapies[87].

_‘Genotoxicity studies are normally not needed for the final vaccine formulation’. But_
these guidelines were drafted well before the invention of the gene-based COVID
‘vaccines’.

11.4. Drug regulators around the world have accepted official product information
statements which acknowledge the omission of this important pre-clinical (in-vitro
and/or animal) genotoxicity and mutagenicity safety data.

11.5. Provisional Approval for the new gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ began early 2021.
However, since then important laboratory genetic data has been published which
raises the theoretical possibility that the mRNA contained in these gene-based
‘vaccines’ may be reverse transcribed (that is, incorporated) into one’s DNA around
the body (including a wide variety of tissues and organs including eggs in the ovary)
which is contrary to the assumptions of the drug regulators such as the TGA. This
research, according to established protocols, was done on an in-vitro human liver cell
line. The potential safety implications for current and future generations are of great
relevance and significance and drug regulators should be demanding immediate
further investigations[89]. These findings raise the possibility that these gene-based
COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ might induce cancers and that these effects may be inherited
into future generations. Until this and other questions are addressed it is not prudent
nor reasonable to claim these products are “safe”.

11.6. Following an extensive critical review of the immunological and metabolic
consequences associated with the mRNA based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’, some expert
molecular biologists have concluded these ‘vaccines’ should be withdrawn due to their
potentially devastating and wide ranging short-term and long-term adverse effects[90].

11.7. Furthermore, in relation to risk-benefit, it has been reported that “based on publicly
available official UK and US data, all age groups under 50 years old are at greater risk
of death after receiving a COVID-19 inoculation than an unvaccinated person is at risk
of a COVID-19 death[91]. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to justify
mandatory vaccination.

11.8. It is also unknown if the Danish drug regulator’s recent decision to cease its genebased vaccination program is related to concerns regarding genotoxicity[92]. The

Danish drug regulatory agency has long been considered to rank among the most
competent regulatory agencies in the world and is highly regarded.

11.9. The issue of potential mutagenicity and genotoxicity is of high importance and received
attention at Australian Senate Estimates on 1 June 2021 (Community Affairs
Legislation Committee)[93].

11.10. In that hearing, Prof. Skerritt (head of the Australian TGA) by Senator Malcolm Roberts
on the potential for the mRNA to enter the nucleus of cells and cause potentially
serious genetic adverse events which could affect future generations:

“Senator ROBERTS: How long before we know the intergenerational effects?

Dr Skerritt: There is no evidence at all from animal or human studies that the
_RNA vaccines, if you're talking about them, incorporate into the genetic material_
_of human beings. They wouldn't have received regulatory approval, and that_
_includes by much bigger regulators such as the FDA, if these bits of mRNA_
_incorporated into the human genetic material. In fact, medicines that_
_incorporate into human genetic material and are inherited are currently not_
_permitted in most major countries, including Australia.”_

11.11. The statement by Prof. Skerritt was made prior to the publications referred to above.
These events provide compelling evidence to reject the indiscriminate general use of
these gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ and to prevent mandatory vaccination on
safety grounds.

###### 12. COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’ Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission 

12.1. The COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ neither prevent infection nor do they prevent transmission
of the infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection is via airborne infection of viral particles
entering via the mucosa (surface lining) of the nose. COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ do not
induce mucosal immunity: instead they induce blood-borne immunity, which is not
effective in countering organisms entering and multiplying in the mucosal tract. This
is why, despite population vaccination rates approaching 90%, COVID-19 cases
remain stubbornly high in many countries.

12.2. ‘Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease
(NIAID) said the viral load of Delta variant in the nasal passages of vaccinated people
was “almost identical” to that in noses of unvaccinated people.[94] It is an accepted
principle that the viral load or amount of virus present is directly proportional to both

the development of symptoms of infection and the ability to transmit the infection to
others.

12.3. Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said publicly
that the COVID-19 vaccines “can’t prevent transmission” [of SARS-CoV-2][95]. This is
basically because the COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection in an individual i.e.
the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ are not “sterilizing”.

12.4. In addition, three articles in The Lancet report that the current COVID-19 gene-based
vaccines do not prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2[96].

12.5. Contrary to initial popular belief and in light of recent evidence, mandatory COVID-19
vaccination will neither significantly or effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or
prevention of transmission of infection to others. According to Gunter Kampf, fully
vaccinated individuals can carry similar viral loads to unvaccinated individuals and
spread the virus just as easily[97].

12.6. Gunter Kampf, stated:

_“There is increasing evidence that vaccinated individuals continue to have a_
_relevant role in transmission. In Massachusetts, USA, a total of 469 new COVID-_
_19 cases were detected during various events in July, 2021, and 346 (74%) of_
_these cases were in people who were fully or partly vaccinated, 274 (79%) of whom_
_were symptomatic. Cycle threshold values were similarly low between people who_
_were fully vaccinated (median 22.8) and people who were unvaccinated, not fully_
_vaccinated, or whose vaccination status was unknown (median 21.5), indicating a_
_high viral load even among people who were fully vaccinated.”_

12.7. The author concludes: “It is therefore wrong and dangerous to speak of a pandemic of
_the unvaccinated”._

12.8. A Wisconsin, USA, study in June/July 2021 (when the Delta variant was prominent)
found no difference for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in viral load measurements
by PCR test cycle threshold (Ct) data between 310 fully vaccinated and 389
unvaccinated individuals: Testing found high viral load in 68% of the fully vaccinated

and 63% of the unvaccinated. This data suggests that vaccinated are just as likely to
be spreaders of SARS-CoV-2[98].

12.9. The risk of infection leading to COVID-19 varies depending on age and clinical status
(including the presence of natural immunity) and must be weighed against the
accumulating evidence of serious adverse effects including death, as well as the
waning efficacy of the vaccines in protecting against infection.

###### 13. Diminished ‘Vaccine’ Efficacy and Potential Negative ‘Vaccine’ Efficacy

13.1. In the first part of 2022 a number of public health sources in the US, Australia,
Denmark, Israel and the UK have suggested the protective efficacy of the COVID
‘vaccines’ is waning or possibly even resulting in “negative efficacy”, i.e. those
vaccinated are at a higher risk of infection. This was in the context of the later
subvariants of Omicron as reported in an observational study of 22,072,550 SARSCoV-2 cases[99].

13.2. The authors state:

_“The vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the third dose was in negative since December_
_20, 2021, with a significantly increased proportion of SARS-CoV2 cases_
_hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated; and a decreased proportion of_
_cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the unvaccinated.”_

13.3. In is acknowledged that epidemiological data interpretation is both challenging and
complicated because there are confounding variables to consider such as age,
gender, vaccination status and co-morbidities. There is also the added complexity of
consideration of the definition of “fully vaccinated” as this varies depending on vaccine
schedules. There remains the lack of distinction between someone hospitalised or
dying “with” COVID versus someone hospitalised or dying “due to” COVID and often
those dying within 14 days of vaccination are often considered as “unvaccinated”.
Overall, however, this large study suggests a negative vaccine efficacy, which is of
great concern.

13.4. The main reason for this negative vaccine efficacy has been mainly ascribed to the fact
that the Omicron strain of viruses which we are experiencing now are considerably
different to the original Wuhan strain and subsequent Delta strain. Those individuals
vaccinated with the gene-based ‘vaccines’ based on the Wuhan strain of virus are
paradoxically more susceptible to Omicron infection.

13.5. Stanford University researchers[100] found that “prior vaccination with Wuhan-Hu-1-like
antigens followed by infection with Alpha or Delta variants gives rise to plasma
antibody responses with apparent Wuhan-Hu-1-specific imprinting manifesting
as relatively decreased responses to the variant virus epitopes compared with
unvaccinated patients infected with those variant viruses.” Basically, these
researchers are saying that vaccination with the current COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ will lead
to a diminished ability to protect from infection by the newer variants.

13.6. Pivotal epidemiological data which is useful in determining vaccine effectiveness
versus time is published by “Our World in Data”, a non-profit organisation based in the
United Kingdom.[101] This organisation uses data sourced from Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE).

13.7. The data below plots the rate (cases per million) of confirmed COVID-19 cases by
selected country versus time (and is updated regularly).

**COVID-19 cases by selected country versus time**

13.8. This same data can be used to represent the 7-day rolling average of confirmed
COVID-19 cases in Australia.

**7-day rolling average of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia**

13.9. COVID-19 vaccination commenced in Australia early in 2021. While the both absolute
number and percent of the population COVID vaccinated increased rapidly for
countries during 2021 and into 2022, the data shows both the rate and absolute
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases markedly increased towards the end of 2021.
This worldwide data demonstrates a failure of the COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ to prevent
infection and transmission of the disease.

13.10. This data strongly suggests that commencing in 2022 the COVID-19 vaccines have
substantially lost the ability to prevent infection and transmission of the virus, despite
high rates of vaccine uptake in the population. This provides evidence of the futility of
vaccine mandates.

13.11. All epidemiological and health statistical data requires careful interpretation as
definitions may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and health protocols can impact
the interpretation of the data. However, without evidence to the contrary, the above
data appears to provide a compelling evidence of a negative vaccine efficacy. In other
words, COVID-19 vaccinated individuals are more likely to be infected with the current
strain of the COVID-19 virus and be admitted to hospital than compared to nonvaccinated individuals.  Similar observations have been made in other countries.

13.12. As mentioned earlier, a major contributing factor to this phenomenon may be due to
the fact that since early 2022, the dominant variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is

Omicron[102] (see graph below) whereas the current COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ are
constructed to produce antibodies towards the original Wuhan strain.

**Share of SARS-CoV-2 sequences that is the Omicron variant by country**

###### 14. The COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’ Do Not Provide a Similar and Acceptable Risk/Benefit Across All Age Groups irrespective of individual Clinical Status including Natural Immunity

14.1. Mandatory vaccination by its very nature assumes that a therapeutic agent produces
a similar risk and a similar benefit for all individuals. However, this is never the case.
Therapeutics should always be prescribed with a consideration of the particular clinical
status of the individual, which is why prescribing information always contains specific
warnings and contraindications of use in relation to age, health status etc. Drugs are
never prescribed on a “one size fits all” basis. Prescribing a drug and ignoring the
particular clinical circumstances of an individual is not good medical practice.

14.2. Natural immunity plays an important role in COVID-19. There is no evidence to
suggest that COVID-19 gene-based ‘vaccination’ offers superior protection from
COVID-19 as compared to natural immunity. Indeed, many believe the reverse is true.

14.3. In acknowledgement of the important role of natural immunity, even Bill Gates,
perhaps the most prominent vaccine proponent, speaking at the Munich Security
Conference reported 23 February 2022[103], admitted that “the virus itself, particularly
_the variant called Omicron, is a type of vaccine”._

14.4. The important role of natural immunity from both a personal and societal point of view
needs to be recognised. This societal natural immunity was commonly referred to as
‘herd immunity’ and was initially widely considered important to limit the impact of the
virus.

14.5. Conventional wisdom suggests that natural immunity following COVID-19 infection
provides a high level of durable protection from re-infection in many ways superior to
“vaccination” because natural immune response is a multifaceted immune response
directed against a number of components including the envelope, the membrane, the
nucleocapsid and the spike within the virus – unlike the immune response produced
by gene-based ‘vaccines’ which only direct the production of specific antibodies only
towards the virus Spike Protein.

14.6. It has been likely that hundreds of millions of people have recovered from COVID-19.
Numerous scientists have found that natural immunity offers a decreased risk of reinfection and extremely low rates of hospitalisation in relation to repeat infection[104].

14.7. A study in Qatar found that ‘natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against
_reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months’[105]._

14.8. The UK study by Hall et al, with funding from the UK Government, reported a similar
level of protection due to natural immunity[106].

14.9. A study in Austria found that the frequency of re-infection from COVID-19 caused
hospitalisation in only five out of 14,840 (0.03%) people and death in one out of 14,840
(0.01%)[107].

14.10. In many ways, natural immunity protection will be superior to the protection afforded
by gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’. In such circumstances, voluntary or mandatory

vaccination with gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ do not offer any additional
protection.  There is no scientific theoretical basis or reliable evidence to suggest that
a person with natural immunity might benefit from administration of a Provisionally
Approved gene-based COVID-19 ‘vaccine’ while the ‘vaccine’ itself has significant
adverse effects and no long-term safety data to support its use.

14.11. A retrospective observational study of 124,500 individuals, conducted during the Delta
wave of SARS-CoV-2 compared two groups: people who had not been previously
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and received a 2-dose regimen of the Pfizer COVID-19
“vaccine” and previously infected individuals who had not been vaccinated[108].
Individuals who had been vaccinated had a 13-fold greater chance of breakthrough
infection compared to re-infection in the non-vaccinated group.

14.12. The conclusion of the authors was: _‘Naturally acquired immunity confers stronger_
_protection against infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant of_
_SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2-2 [Pfizer COVID-19 ‘vaccine’] dose_
_vaccine-induced immunity’._

14.13. While the current SARS-CoV-2 variant is Omicron, in the absence of data to the
contrary, these data provide a compelling case to support the importance of natural
immunity in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

14.14. The Swedish drug regulator is regarded as one of the most respected regulatory
agencies and they have recently reversed its recommendation on the administration
of COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ to adolescent children as they do not see any clear benefit in
COVID-19 vaccination. According to a Reuters news release in Stockholm on 27
January 2022, Sweden decided against recommending COVID-19 ‘vaccines’ for
children aged 5-11, the Swedish Health Agency said that the benefits did not outweigh
the risks: ‘With the knowledge we have today, with a low risk for serious disease for
kids, we don't see any clear benefit with vaccinating them’[109].

14.15. It is reported that children in the population are at a substantially lower risk of
developing COVID-19.[110]

14.16. In addition, it has been suggested that a high proportion of children in the population
have acquired natural immunity which offers better protection from infection as
compared to vaccination. As above, a large study during the Delta wave found
vaccinated individuals had a 13-fold greater chance of breakthrough infection than
unvaccinated individuals had of being re-infected.

###### Conclusion
The introduction and worldwide use of COVID-19 gene-based ‘vaccines’ has been
associated, in the short term, with far more deaths, illnesses, injuries, and disabilities
than any other therapeutic agent in the history of medicine. Due to the total lack of
any long-term safety data, the potential future iatrogenic effects (including
neurological, immunological and carcinogenic effects) may be even more devasting.

Despite initial claims, the COVID-19 gene-based ‘vaccines’ have now been shown to
possess disappointing clinical efficacy - they neither prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection
nor do they prevent transmission of the virus; any immunological protection wanes
rapidly and, coincident with the emergence of the Omicron variant, evidence of
negative vaccine efficacy is being reported in many countries including Australia.

In light of widely reported emerging and compelling evidence, there appears to be little
scientific or clinical justification to support vaccine mandates as a health policy.

The latest hospital admission statistics do not support the claim that unvaccinated
individuals are more at risk of serious COVID-19 disease, hospitalisation or death.
Excess non-COVID-19 related deaths coincident with the introduction of the genebased ‘vaccines’ are now being reported by many countries, and suggest a surge in
heart attack and stroke among both the young, adolescents and middle age individuals
(especially males).

Advocating the worldwide use of a new class of serious COVID-19 gene-based
‘vaccines’ never before deployed, and advocated for use in healthy individuals of all
ages regardless of clinical status (eg. natural immunity, pregnancy etc), with relatively
little short-term safety data and no long-term safety data, is neither prudent or
necessary and defies the Precautionary Principle.

The knowledge that the synthetic mRNA in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can
enter the nucleus of human liver cells in culture, raises the serious questions about
genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, and adverse impact on future generations. Disturbing
safety signals regarding fertility and miscarriages are emerging.

Given the statistically or virtually nil risk of serious COVID-19 in general affecting
children aged 6 months to 11 or 12 years of age and the clear and significant risk of
serious adverse effects including myocarditis, pericarditis and death in this age group
– there seems to be little benefit to be gained by vaccinating these children.

Considerable scientific, clinical and statistical epidemiological data and understanding
has been acquired since the introduction (on a provisional basis only) of the
investigational COVID-19 gene-based “vaccines”.  Many of the initial ambitious claims
and assumed perceptions regarding the safety and efficacy of these serious
therapeutics have now been invalidated and it is now time to review and reconsider
the utility of these products in light of the known unprecedented level of serious adverse
reactions and death attributed to their use.

The urgency for this review cannot be overestimated given the current and potential
future impact on the health and wellbeing of all Australians.

###### Appendix A

**Abbreviated Curriculum Vitae – Dr Phillip Altman**

Dr Phillip Altman has expertise in the areas of clinical medical research and pharmaceutical drug

regulatory affairs in Australia.

Holding the degrees Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons), and Master of Science and Doctor of

Philosophy, Phillip’s doctorate concerned the development new of cardiotonic drugs with lower

intrinsic toxicity, compared to existing drugs including their chemical synthesis and testing in various

animal models.

Phillip has worked primarily within the Australian pharmaceutical industry since 1974 in relation to

clinical trial design, management, and reporting in relation to obtaining new drug approvals, dealing

with the Secretary of the Department of Health, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

After many years working within multinational pharmaceutical companies, Phillip later became a

senior industry pharmaceutical consultant through his contract research company, Pharmaco Pty

Ltd., which provided both clinical trial and regulatory consultant services to the Australian

pharmaceutical industry, which focussed his experience in critically evaluating clinical trial safety

and efficacy data, as submitted in complex new drug dossiers for international regulatory purposes.

This work saw Phillip consulted by more than half of the multinational pharmaceutical companies

in Australia, in various capacities, with a focus on drug regulatory affairs.

Phillip founded the Association of Regulatory and Clinical Scientists (ARCS), which includes more

than 2,000 scientists, clinicians, and associated health professionals involved in both clinical trial

and regulatory affairs, in Australia and New Zealand, where ARCS continues to be the foremost

educational forum for both industry and government (including the TGA) personnel, involved in

clinical trials and regulatory affairs.

Phillip’s experience involves more than 100 clinical trials (covering Phases I,II, III and IV, i.e. from

first administration to animals, then man, to post-approval trials), and a similar number of new drug

applications, TGA appeals, and applications to modify existing approvals. In collaboration with the

TGA and on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, Phillip also directed 2 major drug withdrawals in

relation to public safety. More recently Phillip has been a senior clinical trial and regulatory affairs

advisor to an Australian company which has developed a live virus for the treatment of melanoma.

b since 1 February 2021, there have been at least 108,542 Adverse Events and 723 Deaths
reported in adolescents and adults since the roll out of the Covid-19 Vaccines.

c since 1 February 2021, that together, there have been at least 131,991 Adverse Events
following Covid-19 Vaccines reported in all ages.

d since 1 February 2021, together there have been at least 884 total Deaths as the reported
outcome following immunisation in all ages. and including unspecified ages,

1.2 By comparison, I have also reviewed the TGA weekly safety reports to 5 June 2022. The TGA
reports record that there were:

a 1,470 Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds following 2.2M doses of Pfizer Vaccine.

**2** **DEFINITION OF TERMS:**

2.1 Throughout this report I have used a number of definitions:


**Adverse Events:**


**a)** Adverse Events are defined by the TGA as unintended and sometimes harmful occurrences associated with the use of a medicine, vaccine or medical device (collectively
known as therapeutic goods). Adverse events include side effects to medicines and vaccines, and problems or incidents involving medical devices.

**b)** Examples of adverse events are any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disease associated with the use of a therapeutic good.

**c)** All Adverse events referred to in this document relate to vaccines.

**d)** Adverse Events reported to the TGA have been classified by MedDRA classification

which includes Organ affected and type of reaction. One Adverse Event case can affect
many organs and reaction types can include many MedDRA Classifications.

**e)** Adverse events are defined by the Australian institute of Health and Welfare as

‘incidents in which harm resulted to a person receiving health care’. There is no
definition included on the TGA web site.

**f)** Importantly, an adverse event is not always caused by the therapeutic good itself. The
occurrence of an adverse event does not necessarily mean that there is something
wrong with the therapeutic good.


**Ages:**



 - **Children: Individuals whose ages are 5-11 years.**

 - **Babies/infants: 0-4years**



 - **Unspecified: Age is left blank or marked with a hyphen –**

 - **Adolescents: 12-18**



  - **Adults 19 years and over**

**Covid-19 Vaccines:** There are 4 vaccines that are being administered in Australia. They
include:



- Pfizer Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer Vaccine)



- Covid-19 vaccine Astra Zeneca



- *Nuvaxovid (Moderna) Covid-19 Vaccine



- Spikevax (Moderna) Covid-19 Vaccine



- TNS DAENs database record for Covid-19 Vaccine Type Not Specified.


45


The Time of Covid


-----

*In searches up to 31 Dec 2021, I have searched for 4 vaccines only, because Novavax, or
Nuvaxovid has only been approved for use in Australia from 20 Jan 2022 for people 18 years
and over. On 25 July the provisional approval was extended to 12-17year olds.

**Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN): “The TGA receives Adverse Event reports**
associated with medicines and medical devices. These reports come from a wide range of
sources, including members of the public, general practitioners, nurses, other health
professionals and the therapeutic goods industry and are” stored in an online database.

_[Source: https://www.tga.gov.au/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen](https://www.tga.gov.au/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen)_

**Deaths: Associated with the TGA reporting, this refers to the number of cases where death**
was a reported outcome following immunisation from the DAEN website. It should be noted
that this does not necessarily imply causality. Also, to determine deaths in TGA DAENs website
is quite a convoluted process because the death MedDRA item category has been removed
and so one cannot simply search for deaths.

**MedDRA Classification: The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is an**
internationally used set of terms relating to medical conditions, medicines and medical
devices. Refer to some items below for reference:

Please find a complete listing of MedDRA items using the following link.

**Pfizer Vaccine: is the Comirnaty Covid-19 Vaccine as described in DAENs for all age groups.**
The Pfizer Vaccine was provisionally approved Covid-19 Vaccine for 5-11 year olds. It was
approved by the TGA on 5 December 2021. Roll out of the Pfizer Vaccine for 5-11 year olds
commenced on or about 10 January 2022.

**Spikevax (Moderna) Covid-19 Vaccine: on 17 February 2022 the Spikevax Vaccine was**

**3.** **KEY POINTS TO NOTE**

3.1 In SECTION 1, all the questions relating to the COVID-19 vaccines ask for figures for each COVID
vaccine type from date of approval to the report date.

While the work underlying this report was begun by me around 6 January 2022, the data I
collected was for 2021, and as such, I have a hard end to the year 2021 (31 Dec 2021).

Further, it appears that when the database is searched for each vaccine type from date of
approval to end of 2021, and then when one adds the results, I do not get the same answer
as I do when I search the entire database, all at once, using all 4 vaccines and the dates 1 Jan
2021 and 31 Dec 2021.

For simplicity, I have used this search as my master data search. All the COVID results will
balance to that master data (I cannot explain why this phenomenon exists but suffice it to say,
it goes to data integrity). I will demonstrate this in the following report.

A search for Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and unspecified, reveals the following information:

- Pfizer 25/01/2021 to 31/12/2021

`▫` No. of cases 52,695

`▫` No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 51,641

`▫` No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 264

_Index, page 2-10_

- AstraZeneca 16/02/201 to 31/12/2021

`▫` No. of cases 43,874

`▫` No. of cases with a single suspected medicine 43,108

`▫` No. of cases where death was a reported outcome 439

**_So, I have elected to use this as our master COVID data._**

3.2 In the entirety of this report, whenever I refer to deaths associated with the Therapeutic
Goods Administration (TGA) reporting, I am referring to the number of cases where death was
a reported outcome from the Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) website.

3.3 In Section 2 of this report:

a The data in this report is dated from 1 February 2021 when the Covid-19 Vaccines became
available until to 8 June 2022, being the last date the DEANs data was updated and when
I was briefed to provide this further report.

b The data was extracted by me from the TGA DAENs system over three days: Wednesday
22 June 2022; Thursday 23 June 2022; and Friday 24 June 2022.

c Despite the TGA website stating that its numbers are up to date as at 8 June 2022, which
is 2 weeks before 22 June (first day of data extraction), and 9 June (second day of data
extraction), the same search of the data on Wednesday 22 June and then Thursday 23
June produces different numbers. This is an issue I have identified in my previous
reports.

d The TGA safety reports contain further information than the DAENs database, such as
vaccine doses. I also used the TGA safety reports to cross check the results obtained from
DAENs.

e The TGA safety report as at 9 June 2022 includes data predominantly up to the 5 June
2022. The numbers in DAENs and those in the TGA safety report for Adverse Events are
comparable, I summarise the TGA safety report Adverse Events by vaccine doses further
in my response under Item 5 below.

**3.4** All questions that I have answered have been advised by a letter of instruction from the
instructing legal experts. The questions are integrated into the document.

3.5 Underreporting.

a) As reporting to the TGA Daen’s database is voluntary there is a question regarding data
coverage.

49

The Time of Covid


-----

**b)** It is globally accepted that there is significant underreporting of adverse events to all
voluntary and spontaneous reporting systems. However, the true extent of underreporting is not known.

**c)** Whilst not perfect, the suspected underreporting to the DAEN system can be approximately validated by referring to the Ausvax website and then using their publicly available information on the number of adverse events that they are reporting within 3-7 days
of vaccines being administered. _[Source: Ausvax - https://ausvaxsafety.org.au (Monitors adverse](https://ausvaxsafety.org.au/)_
_events that occur within 3-7 days after vaccination)_

**d)** The comparison above suggests that underreporting to the DAEN website is at least
90%: that is, they are reporting a maximum of 10% of adverse events and not reporting
some 90% of adverse events (as a minimum).

3.6 Appendices. Throughout this document you will see many references to appendices. These
appendices amount to many hundreds of pages and as such are not included with this
document. If there is a need for specific appendices to be accessed, please advise and I can
make links available.

**VACCINES AND NON-COVID-19 VACCINES FROM 1 JAN 1971 TO 31 DEC 2021. Pages 4-19 of original**
**document.**

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) receives reports of adverse events associated with
medicines and medical devices in Australia. That data it collects is accessible via the Database of
Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) on the TGA website. Please use the DAEN data, and only that data,
to answer the following questions, except where otherwise stated. In answering the below questions,
please indicate the relevant pages of the DAEN data which you have used in order to answer each
question:

1. For all of the vaccines in the DAEN combined, except for;
a. Comirnaty Covid-19 Vaccine (Pfizer);
b. Covid-19 Vaccine (TNS) (Janssen);
c. Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca); and
d. Spikevax Covid-19 vaccine (Moderna);
i) How many reports of adverse events were made between 1971 and the date of your
report? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_The number of adverse events from 1 Jan 1971 until 31 Dec 2021 is_ **_19,330. On the_**
_DAEN search engine, type “vaccine” on the first field. Next, select all vaccines, and then_
_deselect the following COVID-19 vaccines so as to exclude them from the search:_

       - _COMIRNATY COVID-19 vaccine_

       - _COVID-19 Vaccine (TNS)_

       - _COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca_

       - _Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine_
_There should be a total of 76 medicines, but this may change depending on the year._
_The search process was undertaken by year starting 1971 until 2021. Below is the_
_search result for the entire year of 1971. The search results for the other years until_
_2021 can be found in Appendix 1._

2. For the three following vaccines which have been provisionally approved by the TGA in relation to
Covid-19, being;
a. Pfizer;
b. AstraZeneca; and
c. Moderna;
i) How many reports of adverse events were made between the date each vaccine was
provisionally approved and the date of your report? Please set out the process by
which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_Initially, I started searching by COVID vaccine type, however, I soon realized that_
_searching by individual COVID vaccine type from date of provisional approval, to the_
_end of 2021, and adding them up did not give the same result as the search if all were_
_done together and I used the blanket dates 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021. I determined_
_to go with the 4 vaccine types and the blanket dates as our master data (as per intro_
_to report). The number of adverse events in total for the 4 vaccines from 1 Jan 2021 to_
_31 Dec 2021 was 100,180 cases, no of cases with a single suspected medicine were_
_98,399 and no of deaths were 733. (You can see that the information from each_
_vaccine type is incomplete. It is also inconsistent with the 4-vaccine approach). See_
_search results below:_

ii) How many reports of death were made between the date each vaccine was provisionally approved and the date of your report? Please set out the process by which you
have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

      - _COMIRNATY COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer):_ **_265 cases where death was a reported_**
_outcome_

      - _COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca: 439 cases where death was a reported outcome_

_The data was taken from Appendix 1 and totals 711 cases where death was a reported_
_outcome. Note that this is for the three (3) aforementioned vaccines only._

_However, as per the DAEN search engine, there is a fourth type of COVID vaccine,_
_medicine name: COVID-19 Vaccine (TNS).This stands for Type Not Specified. I included_
_this upon pulling out information and found a total of 733 cases where death was a_
_reported outcome, as opposed to the total of 711 which is the sum of only three (3)_
_COVID vaccines. Actually, I also ran the unspecified vaccine by itself and I found that_
_when I added that to the above individual vaccines I reported 735 deaths, and not 733._
_I have elected to use the 733 as our master data._

5. How much more likely is it for an adverse event to be reported to the TGA from Pfizer, AstraZeneca
and/or Moderna than it is from all other vaccines in the DAEN combined? Please set out the process
by which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_From 2010 to 2020 the likelihood of someone having an Adverse Event as the result of a vaccine was_
_of the order of 1 in every 10,000 doses. It is 1.1 number of doses using the incomplete number of doses_
_data (see Graph 1) and 0.9 using an estimate for total doses (see Graph 2). In 2021 as the result of_
_COVID vaccinations, I can now expect 23 Adverse Events in every 10,000 doses. I set this data out in_
_the below charts:_

_Graph 1 – Labelled data is based on incomplete data for total non-COVID cases_
_Sources:_

- _No. of adverse events: Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deaths 1971-2021_

- _No of COVID vaccine doses: Appendix 6 – No. of COVID Doses by Vaccine_

- _No of non-COVID vaccine doses: Surveillance of Adverse Events following immunization, annual reports for 2010 to 2019_

_2010 to 2019_

_Refer to search results presented in questions 1 and 2. Note that the non-COVID vaccine adverse events_
_are from 1971 to 2021, while COVID vaccine adverse events are for the year 2021 only._

6. How much more likely is it for a death to be reported to the TGA from Pfizer, AstraZeneca and/or
Moderna than it is from all other vaccines in the DAEN combined? Please set out the process by which
you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_The number of cases where death was a reported outcome to the TGA, associated with a non-COVID_
_vaccine from 2010 to 2021 was 29, or an average of 2.4 deaths per annum vs 733 in 2021 associated_
_with COVID vaccines. This is an increase of 30,442%. It is represented by the below chart._

58

The Time of Covid


-----

_Sources:_

- _No. of deaths: Appendix 3 - Annual Tally of Non-COVID Adverse Events and Deaths 1971-2021_

_Given the size of the increase reported above, another source of deaths associated with vaccines has_
_been located. The Surveillance of Adverse Events following Immunisation in Australia, Annual Reports_
_from 2010 to 2019, report 31 deaths associated with vaccines over 10 years which is an average of 3.1_
_deaths per annum. (Author: The Department of Health, Australian Federal Government) It would_
_appear that the TGA reports of death and the annual report referred to above are inconsistent in the_
_no. of deaths that they report. (Both are, however, reporting on the deaths as a result of adverse events_
_and claim to use the DAEN TGA website as their source of information.)_

_From 2010 to 2021, the likelihood of death from an adverse reaction to a vaccine was 0.22 to 0.27 per_
_million doses (approx. 1 death every 4 million doses). As a result of COVID doses in 2021, I have had 17_
_deaths per million doses. As a consequence, COVID vaccines are 69 times more likely to result in death_
_as a reported outcome than traditional vaccines. (If I use the death figures from the Surveillance of_
_Adverse Events after immunisation in Australia, annual reports from 2010 to 2019, referred to_
_previously, this shows around 0.463 deaths per million doses or 1 death every 2 million doses. This_
_makes the covid vaccines 36 times more likely to result in deaths as aa reported outcome than_
_traditional vaccines)._

recorded in association with Covid-19 itself? You may also refer to data from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics to answer this question. Please set out the process by which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports 773 deaths from COVID from January to October 2021_
_albeit 2 months short of the entire year. In the last 2 weeks of January 2022,when this report was being_
_written, the number of cases where death was a reported outcome, associated with a COVID vaccine_
_in 2021 have increased from 704 to 733. This is reported in the below chart:_

8. What are the most significant categories, or types, of adverse events reported to the TGA for all
vaccines except for Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna from 1971 to the date of this report? Please set
out the process by which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_The top 5 Categories of Deaths by Organ reported to the TGA from 1971 to 2021 non-COVID were_
_General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions, Nervous System Disorders, Infections and_
_Infestations, Investigations (undefined by TGA), Respiratory Thoracic and Mediastinal. The top 5_
_represent 57% of all Deaths by Organ reports. This is represented in the chart below:_

9. What are the most significant categories, or types, of adverse events reported to the TGA for Pfizer,
AstraZeneca and Moderna? How many more categories, or types, of adverse event reports have been
reported to the TGA in relation to Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna than have been reported for all
other vaccines combined? Please set out the process by which you have come to your view.

_My Answer:_

_The Top 5 Categories of Deaths by Organ reported to the TGA for 2021 related to Covid vaccines were_
_Nervous System Disorders, General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions, Respiratory Thoracic_
_and Mediastinal Disorders, Cardiac Disorders and Injury Poisoning and Procedural complications._
_These categories account for 58.8% of all Death by organ reports. This is represented in the chart_

10. Have there been any significant increases in categories, or types, of adverse event reports to the
TGA since the provisional approval of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna?

_My Answer:_

_The number of adverse events reported to the TGA in 2021 is 100,180 relating to COVID vaccines. In_
_summarizing these adverse events by disease type, one event can be reported as many_
_diseases/conditions. I now have a list of 3,122 disease types, more than double the number of different_
_conditions that were reported prior to COVID vaccines. See table below:_

11. Do you have any final observations on comments to make as the result of undertaking this analysis.

_As a final remark, I note that in addition to generating more adverse events and generating more_
_disease types, COVID vaccines are generating more Reaction Reports than seen before by traditional_
_vaccines._

_In fact, the TGA is seeing more Adverse Event Reaction reports in 2021, than they have seen in the_
_entire 50 years since 1971._

_(This is separate and different to Adverse Event Cases. It says that each Non-Covid 1971 to 2021_
_Adverse Event Case would have included on average of 2.27 MedDRA reactions per event. Covid_
_Vaccines 2021 include an average of 3.26 reactions per event. Refer table above for examples of Major_
_Organ classes and Adverse Event Reaction Types.)_

**6.0 ITEM 1**
Since 10 January 2022, how many Deaths are reported in DAENs in 5-11 year olds following Covid-19
Vaccines?

6.1 Since 10 January 2022, 135 deaths following Covid-19 Vaccines are recorded on the DAENs
database for all ages.

6.2 Since 10 January 2022, 5 Deaths were reported in children 5-11 in DAENs since the roll-out of
Covid-19 Vaccines began for this age group.

6.3 Details of these Deaths are set out in Table 1 below. Five screenshots are included in
Schedule B to this report. These screenshots are from the DAENs website for each death
reported in the 5-11 age cohort since the roll out of the Pfizer Vaccine began. Each
screenshot (on the left hand side) confirms “death as a reported outcome” from “a single
medicine”, namely a Covid-19 Vaccine.

**Table 1: Summary of deaths reported to DAENs following Covid-19 Vaccine in 5-11 year olds since**
**the roll out to this age group began on 10 January 2022**

6.5 The DAENs website also routinely reports Deaths where no age is specified. At the time of
producing this report, 90 of the 135 Deaths sampled (14 or 15.6%) had no age specified. It is
possible that some of these Deaths where the age is not specified may also fall within the age
cohort 5-11 years. I have included a further discussion of these Deaths in my response to Item
3 (below).

**7.0 ITEM 2**
Since 10 January 2022, how many Adverse Events were reported in the DAENs associated with 5-11
year olds following Covid-19 Vaccines?

7.1 Since 10 January 2022, 27,742 Adverse Events were reported following Covid-19 Vaccines in
all ages. This number includes the 135 Death reports reported in Item 1 (6.1) above (in all
ages).

7.2 In 5-11 year olds, 1,390 Adverse Events have been reported by DAENs following Covid-19
Vaccines.

7.3 Table 2 below shows breakdown of Adverse Events from 10 January 2022 to 8 June 2022 by
Covid-19 Vaccine type for 5-11 year olds (and includes Deaths). The Pfizer and Spikevax
(Maderna) Vaccine are the only provisionally approved Covid-19 Vaccines for the 5-11 and 611 year old group, respectively. I am not able to explain why there are 5-11 year olds that
received Covid-19 Vaccines not provisionally approved for their age.

**Total** **1390** **N/A** **5**

**Table 2: number reports of Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds following Covid-19 Vaccines since 10**
**January 2022**

7.4 DAENs also records 28 Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds prior to 10 January 2022, when the
Covid-19 Vaccines were rolled out to this age group. I have included details about these 28
reports in Schedule C to this report. These reports begin at 29 September 2021. I cannot
explain why children received the Covid-19 Vaccines before they were provisionally approved
and rolled out to this age group. Nor can I explain why they received Covid-19 Vaccines not
provisionally approved for this age group.

7.5 Note, since 10 January 2022 there are 5,221 Adverse Events in DAENs where no age range is
specified. Absent that detail from the DAENs database, it is not possible for me to say whether
there are more Adverse Events in the 5-11 year old age cohort. I have dealt with this further
under Item 4 below.

7.6 These 1,390 Adverse Events resulted in 3,635 reactions all classified as per the MedDRA
reaction types. At Schedule D to this report, I have listed out the types of Adverse Events being
reported by DAENs by frequency from highest to lowest.

7.7 Table 3 below shows the top 10 Adverse Events reaction types being reported in 5-11 year
olds following Covid-19 Vaccines. These top 10 Adverse Events represent 1,327 reactions or
37% (1,327/3,635) of Total Adverse Event reactions being reported in children aged 5-11 years
of age.

**8.0 ITEM 3**
Since 1 February 2021, how many Deaths were reported in the DAENs in adolescents and adults
following Covid-19 Vaccines?

8.1 Since 1 February 2021, 884 Deaths have been reported in the DAENs database following
Covid- 19 Vaccines (all ages).

8.2 After removal of the Deaths in 5-11 year olds, that leaves 879 Deaths reported in DAENs.

8.3 As mentioned, in Item 1 above, there are a number of reports of Death in DAENs where no
age is specified. I have reviewed in excess of 90% of these deaths and 147 of them had no age
detailed against them. That is 17.6% of the Deaths did not have an age specified, so I have
extrapolated that to be 156 Deaths out of the total 884 Deaths (all ages) where no age is
specified.
_[Source: Death Sample link https://1drv.ms/x/s!Al71AGIGLVVzgkwl1C85ztAq5BTW?e=nz49ZT](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Al71AGIGLVVzgkwl1C85ztAq5BTW?e=nz49ZT)_

8.4 Therefore, from the DAENs data, there are 723 deaths that have been reported in adolescents
and adults following Covid-19 Vaccines (after removal of the unspecified age Deaths and
Deaths in 5-11 year olds).

Since 1 February 2021, how many adverse events were reported in DAENs associated with adolescents
and adults following Covid-19 Vaccines?

9.1 Since 1 February 2021, there were 131,991 Adverse Events reported in DAENs following Covid19 Vaccines (all ages), as per the “Number of reports (cases)” in the screenshot from the
DAENs website below:

**Screenshot 1: Adverse Events reported in DAENs following Covid-19 Vaccines (all ages)**

9.2 Of those Adverse Events reported, the DAENs database states 129,244 are “with a single
medicine”. That is the Adverse Event was following a single medication, ie Covid-19 Vaccine.
I do not use this number for my analysis.

9.3 Separately, I have reviewed the Adverse Events by Covid-19 Vaccine and have set these figures
out in Table 7 below.

9.4 The number of Adverse Event “report (cases)” on the DAENs website is 131,991 (screenshot
1 above). This number is different to the number of Adverse Events I tallied up by each Covid19 Vaccine type by 393 events. From the data, I am not able to explain this difference.

9.5 The number of Deaths I tallied up by Covid-19 Vaccine type is 885 and is also different to the
number of Deaths reported on the DAENs website (884) (screenshot 1 above). From the data,
I am not able to explain this difference.

9.6 Of the 132,384 Adverse Events reported since 1 February 2021 in DAENs, there were 22,007
Adverse Events that were unspecified in terms of age. I have set these out in Table 8.

9.10 There are somewhere between 108,570 and 108,963 Adverse Events from 1 February 2021 to
8 June 2022 which have been reported by the TGA as relating to adolescents and adults
following Covid-19 Vaccine. This includes the 28 Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds which
occurred prior to 10 January 2022 (as detailed in Schedule C to this report). Removing the
Adverse Events in 5-11 year olds prior to roll out of Covid-19 Vaccines to this age group, leaves
108,542 and 108,935 Adverse Events in adolescents and adults.

9.11 There are no COVID-19 Vaccines that have been provisionally approved or otherwise for
children <5, therefore I am unable to explain why there are a number of Adverse Events
reported in 0-4 year olds.

**10.0 ITEM 5**
Where the TGA safety report numbers differ from DAENs, I have also been asked to comment on the
reporting in the TGA safety reports for Adverse Events following Covid-19 Vaccines with respect
children 5-11 and all ages.

10.1 In my previous reports, I have compared reporting of Adverse Events in NON-covid Vaccines
to Covid-19 Vaccines. On 31 January 2022, the likelihood of someone having an Adverse Event
as the result of a NON-Covid Vaccine (between 2010-2020) was 1 in every 10,000 doses. With
Covid-19 Vaccines the likelihood of someone having an Adverse Events as the result of the
vaccine was 23 Adverse Events per 10,000 doses as at 31 January 2022. This is highlighted in
Table 10 below.

10.2 Using the TGA’s more up to date data, the likelihood now of someone having an adverse event
as the result of a Covid-19 vaccine as at 5 June 2022 is 21.87 Adverse Events per 10,000 doses.
This is 20 times worse than Non-covid times and is reasonably consistent with the Adverse
Events I was reporting on at the end of January 2022.
