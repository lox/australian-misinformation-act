**I am submitting my objection and concern about the proposed draft bill #2023 regarding**
**ACMA overseeing misinformation and disinformation on social media in Australia.**
**I feel very strongly that this goes against Australian true values and beliefs.**
**Every Australian should have the right to read, watch and say what they want without being**
**told what is right and wrong by the government or big tech.**
**On more than one occasions these platforms have been the sole providers of the so called**
**‘misinformation and disinformation ’ you are trying to combat. That has not been any**
**clearer than the last 3 years.**

**It astonishing that we are even having to debate this in Australia, aren’t we a free**
**democracy. If this draft bill passes we will be more suppressed by lack of balanced news,**
**science and facts, isn’t this what communist regimes and dictatorships do. I believe it’s**
**called propaganda.**

**The last three years are an excellent example of suppressed free speech under the guise of**
**misinformation and disinformation when many Australians have been silenced and attacked**
**for saying anything that went against the official narrative/agenda at the time.**
**Ironically most of the silenced opinions from experts in their respective fields have proven**
**to be correct and true whilst the official news and information pushed by government and**
**mainstream media at the time has proven to be flawed, false and misleading.**

**I understand and support that there should be laws and rules in place to combat issues**
**such as terrorism, drug and gun smuggling, child exploitation etc however what is being**
**proposed is an extreme overreach of authority and power by the Australian government and**
**ACMA in regards to misinformation and disinformation. Elected officials don’t get to dictate,**
**they are there to serve the people. We should be able to continue to have a balanced, fair**
**and non biased news and information platforms, generations have fought in wars for these**
**freedoms. Australians should be continue to allow free speech, engage in healthy debates**
**and to reach our own conclusions based on facts, experts and history.**
**I strongly reject this bill and oppose and am appalled at this current government for even**
**trying to get it passed.**
