I do not consent to this misinformation disinformation Bill

The mis/dis information from the government and media destroyed many lives over the Covid
period and they have shown that they are capable of acting with reckless abandon and for their
own interests rather than for the benefit of Australians. This Bill will allow more of the same and
worse.

This much control should not be in the hands of the few, especially considering the proposed
consequences. The idea of government approved speech is a hideous concept to be even
considering.

I have no confidence in this government as it currently stands.
