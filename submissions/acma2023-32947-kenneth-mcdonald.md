Subject: Submission on the
Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

Firstly I resent the sneaky tactics whereby
those creating this method of objection
force is th people to have to spend many
weeks researching the below information
in order to respond.

Be well informed here, that we are prepared
to use every legal means available to push
back on this

And so to begin....

I am writing to express my strenuous
objections to the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian
citizen, I am deeply concerned about the
implications this bill holds for our freedom
# of speech and democratic values.

First and foremost, the existence of this bill
demonstrates a lack of respect for the
freedom of speech of Australian citizens.
By creating two distinct categories of
citizens, where certain individuals such as
politicians, journalists, and members of
educational institutions have the power to
spread information, whether it is verifiable
or not, while regular citizens are subject to
punitive measures, this bill violates the
principles of equality and fairness that
underpin our democracy.

I firmly believe that the internet is a
revolutionary democratic tool that has
given a voice to ordinary individuals.
However, this legislation poses a
significant risk of disproportionately
harming those regular citizens who rely on
the internet as a platform to express their
knowledge and insights, often surpassing
the expertise of individuals in the privileged
category mentioned above. The imposition
# of excessive fines and the absence of
mechanisms to alleviate pressure within
the industry will lead to a chilling effect on
free speech, surpassing even the most
restrictive digital services.

falsehood of information is an inherently
complex task. As our understanding of
various subjects continuously evolves, new
information often contradicts previously
accepted notions. As evidenced by various
examples surrounding the COVID-19
pandemic, what was once considered
factual information later turned out to be
false or misleading. Under this bill,
legitimate information could be
categorized as misinformation, stifling
open and honest discussions necessary
for progress and the pursuit of truth.

Additionally, the inclusion of "misleading"
or "deceptive" information within the scope
# of removal further erodes freedom of
speech. Our society thrives on the ability to
engage in open debates, allowing for the
discovery of truth through collaboration
and discourse. Attempts to curtail such
discussions through legislation are
tantamount to censorship and hinder the
democratic process.

Even respected experts, such as Dr. Nick
Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical
Officer of Australia, have expressed grave
concerns about the scope and application
# of this bill. Dr. Coatsworth's statement
underscores the challenges inherent in
implementing legislation of this nature,
raising doubts about its effectiveness and
appropriateness.

Furthermore, this bill purports to protect
minorities but may ultimately lead to their
persecution. Often, progress requires
challenging established facts and beliefs.
However, this legislation's strict codes
applied across all digital platforms leave
minorities vulnerable without any recourse
in the face of pushback from the system.
This oppressive outcome is contrary to the
bill's intended purpose and contradicts the
very notion of progress.


-----

By delegating legislative power to private
entities that are not directly accountable to
Parliament, the bill exceeds permissible
limits. The power granted to the Australian
Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) to administer Misinformation
Codes and Standards infringes upon the
implied constitutional freedom of political
communication, a violation that cannot be
remedied by the provisions stated in the
bill.

Furthermore, the definition of "harm" as
outlined in the bill encompasses matters of
public policy and scientific investigation
that are highly contested among political
parties and interest groups. Any restriction
on legitimate discussion in these areas
infringes upon our implied constitutional
freedom of political communication and
poses a threat to the democratic values we
hold dear.

Australia, as a founding member of the
United Nations and a signatory of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
must adhere to the principles espoused in
Article 18 and Article 19. These articles
emphasize the rights to freedom of
thought, conscience, religion, opinion, and
expression, which include the freedom to
hold beliefs and to seek, receive, and
impart information. Any attempt to
categorize fundamental faith worldviews or
tenets as misinformation demonstrates
intolerance and contradicts the spirit of
human rights.

In light of these concerns, I implore the
Department of Infrastructure, Transport,
Regional Development, Communications
and the Arts to reconsider and withdraw
the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023. Instead, I
urge you to explore alternative approaches

Thank you for considering my submission

I trust that you will give due consideration
to the issues raised herein to ensure that
the voice of ordinary Australian citizens is
heard and respected.

Yours faithfully,

J Kenneth McDonald
