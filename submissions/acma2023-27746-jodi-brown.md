To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my strong an absolute opposition to this proposed Orwellian Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This Bill, if enacted, will be an obtrusive invasion and breech of our human democratic right to freedom of
expression and speech. I do not consent for any regulatory authority to store my personal details or online
comments in any kind of data base to determine whether I should be punished for enacting my right to free speech.
This has got a CCP stamp of Social Credit Scores all over it and is a slippery slope which should never be set into
action or law.

Australia is fast deteriorating into a complete “nanny state”. I have observed this coming for many years but it has
gone into overdrive, particularly over the past 3 years. This is an act of complete government overreach, which
persists and must stop now. We the people do not wish or ask our government to be over-governed. We have a
right to live a free and unhindered life without oppressive government interference.

This Bill is yet another step in the wrong direction. The Australian government had advised Facebook to remove
certain posts over the past few years if they did not fall in line with the government’s narrative, claiming they were
misinformation/disinformation, when in fact years later we learn that some of it was proven to be correct and
factual information!

Who are the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and where do they get their funding from?

Who are they associated and aligned with?

How do they “fact check” the information and who decides if the content is misinformation or disinformation? And
who “fact checks” the fact checkers?

These are all relevant questions as it is well known that information that is provided to the public is subject to biases
based on the narrative its source supports and who received funding to provide that information. Conflicts of
interest are historically perceived to direct politics. An example of this (within an industry) is the Coca Cola Company
funding studies into the effects of sugar, with the scientists on the payroll downplaying the damaging effects of sugar
in the diet.

Since you feel it’s necessary to protect the public from misinformation and disinformation, perhaps you can focus
your attention on the harmful misinformation and disinformation that the main stream media has been peddling.
Not to mention their omission of crucial correct information.

So, hands off the public’s right to freely express our opinions. Allow the public to use their own discernment – and
do their own research, if so inclined – on the information they come across on- line, on social media. We do not
need a government chosen entity monitoring and censoring information that is being shared. We can all use our
own judgement, thank you.

What we do not need is more government overreach in the way of this act which seeks to thwart and punish
individual - and collective - freedom of expression and speech and erode the right to share information without
threat of punishment.

We do not currently have a Bill of Human Rights in this country, but we surely need one.

Yours Sincerely,

Jodi Brown
