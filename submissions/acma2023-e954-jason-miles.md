Please find attached my submission response to the “New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation.” I
am fine to publish my letter and name but NOT my email address, NOT my PO Box address, and NOT my mobile. I’d think the
Privat Act would cover this anyway, however, I just wanted it noted. My personal details are contained in the signature of this
email.

Today, I write to underscore the fundamental importance of free speech, opinion, and proper discourse as essential pillars of
a thriving democracy.

In the tapestry of democratic societies, the freedom to express ourselves is a cherished and constitutional right. It serves as
the lifeblood of an open and inclusive nation, allowing individuals to voice their beliefs, ideas, and concerns without fear of
retribution. It is through this free exchange of thoughts and opinions that our democracy finds its strength and resilience,
fostering an environment where all people are encouraged to participate actively in shaping our collective future.

Opinions, however diverse they may be, constitute the heart of a vibrant democracy. They are the engines of innovation and
progress, driving us towards new solutions to complex challenges. Each individual's unique perspective adds colour to the
canvas of our nation's discourse, enriching the dialogue and broadening our understanding of the issues at hand. By
respecting and engaging with differing viewpoints, we cultivate an atmosphere of intellectual growth and mutual respect,
transcending our differences to forge common ground for the betterment of society.

The Covid-19 pandemic response has shed light on the fragility of these values, as information presented by public health
authorities was later proven false. Those who dared to challenge prevailing narratives were censored and suppressed, and in
time, many claims were vindicated. Such instances emphasize the need for responsible exercise of free speech,
understanding that our words can have significant consequences. It is vital that we condemn hate speech, disinformation,
and any form of harmful rhetoric, while still promoting an environment of open dialogue and creativity.

Misinformation is often a headline snip that may not have the full context, and that happens in everyday life. Disinformation
is knowingly spreading information that is simply not true, and that is exactly what happened during the pandemic. In April
2021, then Health Minister, Greg Hunt told all Australians that the vaccines were 100% safe and effective. We later learned
that was simply not true and Hunt should not have made that claim. Yet people made decisions based on his comments.
Decisions that in some cases have impacted their lives such as the 16 official reported deaths by Covid vaccines with another
950 reported deaths but yet to investigated.

It is therefore crucial to recognize that the exercise of free speech should be balanced with responsibility and an awareness
of the consequences of our words. That is, hate speech should not be accepted. Adults luring children into transgender or
paedophilia ideologies should not be accepted. Public bureaucrats spreading disinformation should not be accepted.
Although we have the right to voice our thoughts openly, we must remember that our freedom ends where it infringes upon
the rights and well-being of others, something our elected politicians seem to have forgotten. Constructive dialogue
necessitates the ability to listen attentively, empathize with others, and engage in respectful debate. What becomes of this
nation if we are all forced to think within certain parameters? Where is the evolution of thinking and creativity?

Proper discourse in a democracy involves fostering an environment that encourages critical thinking, fact-checking, and
reasoned argumentation. When we engage in substantive debates based on evidence and reason, we elevate the level of
discourse and safeguard our democracy from misinformation and propaganda. Moreover, engaging in civil discussions rather
than resorting to hostility or vitriol strengthens the fabric of our society and maintains the integrity of our democratic
principles.

History has taught us that when free speech and opinion are suppressed or silenced, the foundations of democracy crumble,
leaving room for authoritarianism and tyranny to take hold. Therefore, as responsible citizens of this great democracy, it is
our duty to defend and uphold these liberties not only for ourselves but for future generations.

In conclusion the vitality of free speech opinion and proper discourse in a democracy cannot be overstated These liberties

our society, let us always remember to champion these principles with unwavering dedication and respect for one another.

Australians have lived and thrived without censorship since the advent of the internet. Yet here we are in 2023 as a multicultural democracy forced to defend itself against the governments paid to govern for us, not over us. I simply choose not to
consent to these laws nor contract with the Australian Government that Gough Whitlam created in 1973 using the Seas &
Submerged Lands Act 1973, and the Australia Act 1986 that expanded the states control. I am a subject under the
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution of 1 January 1901, which is the supreme law of this country. The Commonwealth
was created as indissoluble, meaning it cannot be dissolved.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I am all for a shared commitment to upholding what it means to be
Australian within a democracy and not an over-governed state.

Create a stunning day and always stay curious.
