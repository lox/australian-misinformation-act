"DISINFORMATION" BILL – WHY IT MUST NOT BE PASSED

Who decides what is "disinformation"?

Who fact checks the "Fact Checkers"? – Open to manipulation and corruption

Most of the "conspiracy theories" from the last 3 years have been proven to be correct.

In fact, most of the disinformation from the last 3 years has come from the government and
mainstream media, both of who will not have to comply with the "Disinformation Bill", which in
itself is manifestly wrong. Any such Bill, if passed must apply to ALL; Government, Media
and Individuals.

Why this Bill should not pass;

    - Infringement of FREEDOM OF SPEECH which is a fundamental Human Right

    - Infringement of DEMOCRACY, in which Freedom of Speech is a cornerstone

    - **FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION is protected by Article 19 of the United Nations**
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Terms like free speech, freedom of
speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse.
However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of
**seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the**
**medium used.**

Any Bill that that infringes on the Democratic Right to Freedom of Speech is a form of
**tyranny used by Communist countries to oppress their citizens.**
