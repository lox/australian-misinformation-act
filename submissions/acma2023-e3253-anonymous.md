Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am a mother a wife a grandmother and a retired Teacher Aide and a member of them I am putting
forward this submission with a heavy heart, what has become of our free beautiful country. This bill will cause great
division.The proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’ is a disaster. In it, the government is communicating to the Australian
people that it distrusts the public but has full confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’
mentality is undemocratic and will prove devastating for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that
responsibility away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its
citizens from ideas. Australians must exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them.

We are all prone to making mistakes. No one is able to be the sole source of truth, most definitely not a group of
unelected bureaucrats in Canberra. The thought that an unelected body has that level of discernment is a joke.

This bill has shades of Hitler all over it.
