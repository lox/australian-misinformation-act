I am deeply concerned for myself and my family about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the
internet can be used to promote all kinds of information, some of which is untrue. The answer is not to make the government the
arbiter of truth and to censor those it disagrees with. We are free to disagree graciously as it’s important to have two sides of an
argument to choose. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of bad ideas with an open critique of those bad ideas
is the only way the truth can prevail. We want freedom of choice and democracy to prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech democracy and conscience.
Our nation had it right all along by our constitutional rights. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it and
suppress our freedoms and liberties given to us by our constitution.

This bill represents complete government overreach, harsh penalties and regulations.More than that, it is a path to
authoritarianism and communism. Some governments today willingly and unlawfully control what is allowed and not allowed to be
said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism,
corruption and tyranny. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal.
