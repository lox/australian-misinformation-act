This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective.
What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It is
simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.
As an ex Registered Nurse of over 40 yrs experience, a mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother and committed Christian, I find
this an entirety ridiculous attempt to control every Australian.Its not just harmful but absolutely ridiculous .
Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This proposed bill
is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.and never repeated.
