# To the management of the Australian Communications Media Authority.
 I write to display my great displeasure of the Commonwealth Government's attempt to close down the flow of free speech and free ideas, between our people, in this supposedly democratic country.
 It is noticed that the Commonwealth Government is attempting to make sure that this legislation exempts the Government itself from the directives of this Bill. It has been also noticed that it is the Government that regularly places misinformation and disinformation on all media platforms. One only needs to refer to the last three years of lies dispensed by both of the recent Governments in regard to the Covid-19 scam and the “killer vaccine” following. Many more people lost their lives or are suffering horrendous health outcomes because of the faith that they were being told the truth by GOVERNMENT, than would  have been normal.
 Many more would probably have suffered the same fate except that they took notice of writings and videos shown on social media.
 There are many more incidents of Governments both State and Commonwealth telling outright lies using all media platforms. Some such stories are the death of Prime Minister Harold Holt, the Hilton Hotel bombing, the Port Arthur Massacre, the Sydney Siege and the Queensland deaths of 3 police officers and 4 civilians.
 It is not that the public need to be protected from a few demented characters using the social media that legislation needs to be put in place, but the protection from Government and Main Stream Media lies and deception is probably what is needed.
 I have an interesting question. Why is it that the Government Authority that is the beneficiary of all this extra power, is to where we have been asked to forward our concerns?
