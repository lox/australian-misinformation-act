# Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)

**Bill 2023 is an abomination and should be abandoned in its entirety.**


# Key points

                    - Figure 6.31 in the ACCC Digital Platform Inquiry
(left) highlighted that 47% of Australians are
concerned by stories that are made-up for
political and commercial purposes and
commentary that is biased or misleading.

                    - Rather than face-up to the trust-crisis and the
resulting harms, and in direct contradiction to its
stated purpose, the ACMA Misinformation and
**Disinformation Bill will diminish the ability of**
citizens to speak-out against false narratives and
lies promoted by government.

**By ignoring issues of greatest concern to**

**consumers of news and current affairs while censoring competing views and debate**
**the proposed Bill will further erode trust and damage our democracy going forward.**

  - Stories about the news, shaped to elicit a one-sided response around issues from COVID

to Donald Trump, climate change and The Voice dominate the education and
information marketplace. However, the proposed Bill specifically excludes
**governments and other primary sources of misinformation, including government**
**funded institutions from any form of regulatory control.**

  - Despite the intended purpose of seeking “a balance between the public interest in

_combatting the serious harms that can arise from the propagation of misinformation_
_and disinformation, with freedom of speech” the proposed Bill does not protect_
Australians from harms and narratives promoted via activists such as the WWFassociated Climate Council, Farmers for Climate Action or at The Conversation.

  - It is diabolical that storytellers and communication-shapers at the University of

Canberra, and a Chinese outfit that specialises in cultural conversations were contracted
by the ACMA to advise the Australian government on the need for combatting
**misinformation and disinformation. As institutions that contribute to, and maintain a**
vested interest in the distrust problem, their ‘analyses’ and spin can hardly be regarded
as contributing to a non-partisan solution.

  - Orwellian in the extreme, as the thin edge of a long wedge, the proposed Bill is an

abomination. For our democracy to flourish the Bill must be withdrawn.

# Executive summary

The 2019 ACCC Digital Platform Inquiry to government highlighted that 47% of Australians are
concerned by stories that are made-up for political and commercial purposes, and biased or
misleading commentary. However, the proposed Bill sidesteps the issue of harmful, fake and
misleading ‘news’, created deliberately to disinform, disempower or mislead.

Australians are bombarded by stories about news, and communications that are purposefully
_shaped to support government and corporate narratives. It is therefore extremely concerning_
that the proposed Bill is de facto a coercive attack on free speech, including political speech.
Reserve Powers allow the ACMA scope to ‘turn-the-screws’ and thereby gradually intrude into
and force compliance (via content moderation) across all forms of digital discourse at ACMA’s
discretion. While trust in news is at a low ebb, censorship is not the answer.

Australians also do not need an overarching digital-nanny determining what is misinformation,
disinformation and ‘hurt’. Weaponisation of clichéd terms and reasoning that they threaten
“the safety and wellbeing of Australians”, and “our democracy, society and economy” implies
that only one Soviet-style viewpoint is valid. Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that the source
**of much “online content that is false, misleading or deceptive” including social commentary,**
**professional news and propaganda directed at specific groups such as non-indigenous**
**Australians, farmers, mothers and schoolchildren, is** **directly marketed by, or sponsored by**
**government, NGOs and their agencies, which the proposed legislation specifically excludes.**

Manipulating public opinion via misinformation and disinformation is an Orwellian sciencebased industry, with hubs at Canberra, Monash, Charles Sturt and other universities. Selfbadged information and public relation managers are also widespread and are often used to
white-wash or green-wash corporate messaging. Government agencies also employ marketing
branches that jostle for strategically-focussed market-share. Devious and deceptive marketing
by government and its instrumentalities is contrary to the public interest.

For example, dressed in emotional rhetoric, words uttered directly by the Prime Minister
relating to The Voice (“a modest request”), disguises its true intentions (voice, treaty, truth,
reparations). Fortunately, as false narratives and intended consequences are exposed, support
for The Voice is plummeting.

We have also seen across the world and in Australia, many instances of overreach by politicians
and NGOs, compliant media, and corporate ‘enforces’ pushing vested interests across the
political spectrum onto their largely ignorant populace. Net zero is a poignant example.

Standards and activities that enable citizens to be cancelled, silenced or punished for having
contrary views, or that prevent alternative views being aired or debated due to some alleged
collective ‘harm’ is Orwellian in the extreme. Like Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act
**_1975, as the thin edge of a long wedge, the proposed Bill is an abomination. For our democracy_**
to flourish the Bill must be withdrawn.

# Recommendation

As the proposed Bill is an affront to Australia’s democratic processes and our way of life, it is
recommended that it be withdrawn.

Yours sincerely,

Dr Bill Johnston

# Discussion

**Post-truth**

Post-truth is a disease of our age that affects everybody, particularly women and children who
are most likely to be targeted by soft-marketing and fear-based campaigns and motivated by
symbolism such as statements from the heart. Waged and managed by unscrupulous players
including activists, governments, influencers and non-government organisations (NGOs), such
campaigns increasingly dominate the information marketplace.

In developing its narratives and recent report to Government on misinformation, ACMA
contracted the News and Media Research Centre (N&MRC) at the University of Canberra (UC).
N&MRC specialises in, and advocates for, “a media system that builds trust, inclusivity and
_diversity, to defend and repair the social fabric”. They say their work “informs government_
_policy in the areas of media regulation, misinformation, Indigenous affairs and public health”._

However, their building inclusivity _and diversity covertly implies imbalance, i.e., that the media_
landscape is one-sided, white and male. Further, while advocating in respect of indigenous
affairs and health, N&MRC is blind to the contribution of British and European technologies,
heritage and laws to the education, wellbeing and advancement of the UC’s present-day
student cohort. Implied or not, such self-exaltation and covert messaging is manipulative rather
than informative.

According to its website, N&MRC teaches prospective journalists how “to communicate the
_stories of people” and how “to shape the way we communicate”. Turning factual, black-and-_
white news into stories, and shaping those stories into ‘communications’ is central to the
_distrust_ _crisis facing mainstream media. For example, increasingly burdened over recent_
decades by waffly-concepts of inclusivity and diversity, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
has fallen from being the most trusted, to arguably the most biased news source in Australia. In
contrast, Sky News with its direct, investigative style has flourished. By neutralising and shaping
the meaning of objective truth, N&MRC perpetuates a problem they contribute to creating in
the first place.

Australians of all backgrounds and creeds should have access to timely, trustworthy
information and news that is not filtered through climate, diversity, inclusivity, gender-diverse,
racial, indigenous or political microscopes, and spun and shaped to mean something different
to, or even diametrically opposite to the ‘truth’ as it was once known. Opinions and debate
**that is not served-up by ‘approved’ sources is central to the functioning of our liberal**
**democracy and if news services cannot deliver trustworthy in-depth unbiased coverage,**
**citizens must be free to seek alternatives free of coercive oversight.**

The ACMA also used We Are Social, who gloatingly self-badge as “a global socially-led creative
_agency with unrivalled social media expertise” (https://wearesocial.com/au/). WE ARE SOCIAL_
are owned by the Chinese BlueFocus Communication Group. They say on their website that
their “strategic thinking is based not only on audience and category, but cultural conversation”.

For Australia’s culture to evolve, cultural conversations must include robust debate and callingout of issues, which should not be restricted by virtue of some notion of harm, including
genderism and racism. As a form of cultural conversation, gender fluidity for example, is a
phenomenon that most adults consider distasteful, regressive and harmful to the children to
whom it is marketed. But such themes increasingly dominate primary school curricula, without
debate or parental consent. In contrast, the unfairness and consequences of biological males
competing in girls and women’s sports is ignored or suppressed.


-----

It fails the pub test that storytellers and communication-shapers at the University of Canberra,
and a Chinese outfit that specialises in cultural conversations have been contracted to advise
the government on Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation. Further, if the Bill passes
into law, it will have global implications. Despite the First Amendment to the US Constitution,
the custodian of truth will be ACMA and they will be empowered to turn-the-screws and
gradually restrict freedom of speech, including political speech deemed by them as capable of
causing harm, a nefarious concept at best.

# The COVID example (ACMA Fact Sheet 1)

Provided venerable cohorts are offered appropriate protections, contrary to government
messaging, a relatively small proportion within the population would fall victim to COVID.
Considering that the vaccines were experimental and did not guarantee immunity, get-it and
_you will get over-it (herd immunity) was an option that was not openly canvassed or debated_
by the so-called experts. Thanks to South Australian Senator Alex Antic’s dogged investigations,
it is increasingly apparent that Australia’s COVID experts gave incorrect and biased advice.

The response to COVID was also manifestly excessive. $millions were shovelled out the door,
seemingly without consideration of consequences and benefits. Major corporate beneficiaries
were not openly disclosed while unvaccinated workers were denied jobs. That the actions of
governments could effectively shut-down the Australian Constitution under the guise of a
“National Cabinet”, that was itself not constitutionally enshrined, also set a dangerous
precedent. In contrast, in the US State of Florida the overall response to COVID was measured,
flexible and appropriate. While people still fell ill and a proportion of mainly elderly people
died, schools and businesses remained open and vaccines and masks were not mandated.

In Sweden the pandemic response was essentially voluntary. Schools remained open,
vaccinations and masks were not mandated. Sweden subsequently reported the lowest excess
mortality rate of nations listed in a recent OECD report
(https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/sweden-has-the-lowest-excess-mortality-rateafter-the-pandemic-despite-refusing-to-lock-down/newsstory/df50001366bb09b6a20421520cbfbf53). Posturing about COVID was essentially directed
at Australian citizens by government, not misinformation or disinformation sourced from
Facebook or blogs.

**Whether people turned to online sources to appraise and compare messages is not the**
**business of the ACMA. It is also not the business of government to restrict or censor material**
**that may be contrary to questionable policy. Sinister overtones emanating from the World**
Economic Forum who saw the pandemic as a plank in their “great reset”, or the UN and other
bodies desiring to control sovereign nations added another layer of concern, which was deftly
ignored by the COVID debate, including by the ACMA. Even the origins of the virus were
initially hushed and supressed out of concern for relations with China.

An unknowable proportion of COVID responses reported in Fact Sheet 1, also reflected anger,
resentment and frustration by the community directed specifically at the so-called ‘science
_experts’ who sought to direct their lives. Also, disgust and dismay that police services issued_
fines, used pepper-spray, fired rubber bullets and arrested protestors including a pregnant
woman, dressed in her pyjamas and in front of her children in her home in Ballarat.
Reminiscent of Germany and eastern Europe three generations ago, views of Police on
horseback, and Australian Defence Force personal patrolling locked-down streets were chilling.
Such scenes reinforced how fragile our freedoms are and how quickly and without consent,
they could be taken away.


-----

People were being traced, shot-at, locked-in hotels and their homes, citizens were denied reentry to their homeland, some were unable to attend the funerals of loved-ones, children were
separated from their school-friends and the list goes on. Australians cherish their hard-fought
**liberties and pitting police and the ADF against the people they are ostensibly commissioned**
**to protect is a blot on our democracy and the freedoms that we as a nation must stand up**
**and defend from the elites, the WEF and the UN.**

Official claims that the vaccines were safe and effective were not true. Masks were also
ineffective. Contact tracing and COVID-passports were an intrusion on liberty that did not work.
It also remains to be seen if those strategies saved lives. In addition, studies have come to light
that dispute that Ivermectin and other treatments were ineffective in combatting or reducing
harm caused by the COVID virus. The best that could be said during the early stages of the
pandemic is that studies were inconclusive. Vaccine manufactures were granted indemnity, and
while using propaganda tools to protect their back, government ‘experts’ were shooting from
the hip.

The recent Shergold Report (https://independentcovidreview.com/) discusses some of these
issues, including heavy-handedness, overreach, and lack of preparedness and empathy by
government. It is apparent from the report that misinformation narratives did not result in the
“wide range of acute and chronic harms” as claimed by ACMA in Fact Sheet 1. Better to
**educate online uses to discriminate and evaluate than apply the heavy-hand of censorship,**
**and what that entails for freedoms of expression which are the hallmarks of a vibrant**
**democracy.**

# Donald Trump, the march on the Capitol and QAnon

Linking Donald Trump and the US Presidential election, the so-called march on the Capitol and
QAnon to the proposed Misinformation and Disinformation legislation is disingenuous and
patently absurd. There is widespread evidence of corruption during the 2020 presidential
election. Also, that following numerous enquiries and questions being raised in the US Senate,
that the FBI and Department of Justice has been weaponised specifically to ‘get Trump’, a
theme that has been supported by mainstream-media. Ignored by the same mainstream
media, the Biden and Clinton crime families are also being exposed for what they are and who
they favoured.

Increasingly frustrated and disenchanted by widespread corruption at the highest levels within
their institutions, the American dream is breaking down. In response, former President Trump
rightfully pointed out that America is “a nation in decline”. Misinformation and cannedmessaging by the mainstream media and the failure of government to address obvious
shortcomings is causing society to fracture. Seemingly unending and strategically motivated
battles between the left (the Democrats supported by the media including social media), and
centre- to right-leaning voters, mainly Republicans are a consequence of that. With the
government out of control, inflation, homelessness, drugs, open borders and other problems,
the rise of groups such as QAnon and Black Lives Matter can reasonably be expected under the
circumstances.

Given the magnitude and range of problems faced by the USA, the rising influence and
militarism of China, corruption surrounding the conduct of recent elections and surrounding
and engulfing President Biden, it is surely satire that the ACMA touches on such issues to
support its Misinformation and Disinformation case.


-----

Democracy requires high-level corruption to be exposed and for those engaged to be brought
to justice. In seeking support for new powers to combat misinformation and disinformation,
there is nothing less relevant to freedom of speech in Australia than the breakdown of trust in
main-stream media and their contribution to the wreaking of havoc across America.

# Climate change and warming

Government sponsored fear campaigns relating to climate change and warming have been ongoing for almost four decades. However, the premise that the climate is controlled by carbon
dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gasses (GHG) in the atmosphere has never been proved
beyond reasonable doubt (i.e., with low uncertainty). Success of the campaign is largely due to
the project being well-funded and coordinated, and that from its earliest days in the 1980’s the
debate was persistently one-sided.

The question whether CO2 affected the climate was never seriously considered. Instead, based
on no data at all, the effect of CO2 was assumed. Thus, the questions revolved around to what
extent [did GHGs affect the climate], by how much [was temperature likely to increase], at
what rate [with benchmarks set at 50-year intervals], and projected impacts [on iconic sites
_such as the Murray-Darling basin, south eastern Australia where most Australian’s lived, the_
_Great Barrier Reef and islands in the south Pacific such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu]._

Driven relentlessly by well-funded activist organisations, particularly WWF, groups and
institutions funded by government such as the Climate Commission, government institutions
including CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the ABC, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences, and universities, even though the proposition was nefarious
and absurd from the beginning, without promising the type of climate they would deliver, both
major political parties adopted similar positions on climate.

Following in the footsteps of German Nazi politician Joseph Goebbels, chief propagandist from
1933 to 1945, the western world has never been subject to such a nefarious campaign waged
primarily by the World Meteorological Organisation and since its formation in 1988, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Australia played a key role in both
organisations, those involved being former Director of the Bureau of Meteorology (1978 to
2003) Dr John Zillman (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zillman) and Bureau Scientist Dr
Neville Nicholls (https://www.eoas.info/biogs/P003289b.htm). As Bureau Director, Zillman was
politically active within CSIRO, the office of the Chief Scientist and various scientific academies
such as the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering and the Australian
Academy of Science. While on the one-hand Zillman was heavily involved with the IPCC,
assisted by others, he also had a direct role in influencing and mediating the government of the
day’s response.

In a Letter to the Editor of the Australasian Journal of Environmental Management (10:3, 192194 (1993), DOI: 10.1080/14486563.2003.10648590), in response to a review of their book
published earlier by Zillman, Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen and Aynsley Kellow pointed out that
“Governments decided to establish an intergovernmental panel to produce a consensus in
**_advance of any significant evidence of global warming for the political purpose - stated by_**
explicitly by UNEP's Mustafa Tolba - of assisting the development of a climate convention.” So,
it was clear at the outset that despite no evidence that greenhouse gasses were warming the
climate, the IPCC aimed to develop a consensus for political purposes and that IPCC was the
instrument that facilitated that outcome.


-----

For his part, while with the assistance of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)
Zillman was at the forefront of establishing the IPCC, Nicholls worked in the background to
ensure that homogenisation methods adopted by the BoM were unified with those of other
groups: NOAA's MLOST, NASA's GISTEMP, and the UK's HadCRUT. Thus, under the auspices of
the WMO, by adopting consensus-based methods, temperature trajectories produced by
international climate groups and the BoM more-or-less agreed with outcomes determined by
the IPCC.

[Although there many players, the main background consensus-seeking paper was: Peterson
TC, Easterling DR, Karl TR, Groisman P, Nicholls N, Plummer N, Torok S, Auer I, Boehm R, Gullett
D, Vincent L, Heino R, Tuomenvirta H, Mestre O, Szentimrey T, Salinger J, Forland EJ, HanssenBauer I, Alexandersson H, Jones P, Parker D. 1998. Homogeneity adjustments of in situ
**atmospheric climate data: a review.** _International Journal of Climatology 18: 1493–1517._
https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(19981115)18:13<1493::AID-JOC329>3.0.CO;2-T.]

Boehmer-Christiansen and Kellow also note the “important ways in which [the IPCC] falls short
_of normally accepted scientific standards of conduct [including]: lead authors acting as editors;_
_lead authors inviting contributions; lead authors selecting reviewers; lead authors deciding_
_whether and how to respond to criticisms; the absence of a non-publication option; self-_
_citation; citation of yet-to-appear work.” Added to that list was the increasing resistance by_
Journal Editors to publish scientific papers that my not support or may refute the global
warming narrative. As peer reviewers are conscious of the possible threat of contrary views,
peer review acted as a filter whereby publishing ‘outside the club’ became increasingly difficult.

Although praised as a scientist by Boehmer-Christiansen and Kellow, if he was, Zillman would
have rolled up his sleeves and carefully examined the data on which the global warming thesis
was based. But as a self-stated “practitioner at the (national and international) interface of
_climate change science and policy for most of the past 25 years” Zillman advocated for and_
cultivated the narrative to which most of the western world has now succumbed.

Many of Zillmans publications attest that Australia was at the forefront of the scam. Like
Anthony Fauci’s role in funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan laboratory which led to
the COVID-pandemic, Zillman, Nicholls and others were instrumental in building the enabling
architecture for the IPCC, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Accord et al and all that followed.

**Summary**

There can be little doubt that with rising community concern about proposed government
restrictions aimed to force compliance of WEF and UN mandates, and control the climate
including the rollout of digital ID, digital currency, accounting of personal carbon footprints and
other measures such as smart metering, carbon taxes on livestock and farming, that the new
ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation are intended to tame the stories,
and shape and limit debate of the major freedom-limiting powers faced by Australians.

**Conclusion**

The proposed bill is anti-democratic, an assault on free speech and should be abandoned.
