Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am writing to put forward some of my concerns about this proposed/draft Bill 'Combating Misinformation and
Disinformation'. In my mind it raises a lot of questions that need to be addressed.

Surely ACMA, "Fact-Checkers" and/or digital social media platforms should not be made judge and jury over what
they deem is misinformation. Is Australia a free country or not? If the answer is "yes" then we should be free to state
our opinions and beliefs on any one subject just as others are free to disregard it if they have opposing views. If
Australians are going to be made subject to this Bill; speech/healthy debate could be curtailed causing detriment to
our human rights. It is imperative that free speech is safeguarded.

Furthermore, the Bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’. This is very subjective because
what someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful. It is simply not possible to police such
subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is more of the same and as such should be rejected.
