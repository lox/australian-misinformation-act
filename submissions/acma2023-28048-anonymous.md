# Please include my submission regarding this Bill - Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating misinformation and disinformation)
 This Bill brings to mind the case that well-known Poet John Milton defended in Parliament in 1644 regarding censorship of books and pamphlets. He supported Galileo who was punished severely for suggesting the Earth rotates around the Sun.  He had 4 good points, one being "licensing would have the unintended effect of weakening people’s ability to recognize and affirm truths by using their reason. This argument draws on Milton’s belief that truths must be known by the use of reason rather than by acceptance of authority; unless a rich body of ideas, including some false ones, is available for rational debate, people’s faculty of reason will not flourish." Licensing of the press continued until 1695. This Bill takes us back into the past where we lost 51 years of free thought.
 This Bill is an overreach and suggests people do not have rational faculty to dismiss writings found in social media or other digital forms.
 This Bill goes against freedom of speech.
 This Bill assumes government is the only source of truth. None of us believe that, and I have witnessed members of parliament being censored on Social Media over the last few years.
 This Bill will take us into the dark ages where free thought and creation cannot happen outside the government.
 This Bill provides for a dictatorship and will suppress any other political messaging or contradicting ideologies from having a voice. It allows rogue governments to flourish. This is undemocratic.
 We have seen people who are at the top of their profession being censored by social media in recent years. This is not acceptable.
 Please do not allow this Bill to go forward.
