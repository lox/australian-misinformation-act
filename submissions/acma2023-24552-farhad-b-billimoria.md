**My Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**

**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

Dear Committee Members,

I strongly oppose this amendment to the Bill being formulated into Law.

Censorship of any kind does not work. It has never worked anywhere at any time. History
bears witness to that fact.

Manipulating truth in any way makes it a lie. Manipulated lies only silence the truth. And
silenced truth only leads to anarchy, chaos, destruction, and death. As a responsible and
well-functioning democracy, we can safely get rid of this amendment.

The only way to combat disinformation, misinformation and lies is healthy debates and
discourse and plenty of communication. That is the way a healthy democracy works.

Farhad B Billimoria.
