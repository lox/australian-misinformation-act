As a free and sovereign human being I extremely oppose this proposed Legislation.

An average person is more than capable of reading, researching and analyzing any information
they come across and make their own informed decisions. It is not the government’s job or
responsibility to limit public’s access to information under the guise of ensuring public safety.
What is proposed here is essentially giving the government the authority to spy on the public and
silence any opposing views. The only way to counter misinformation is by making the right
information available to the public.

How can it this is for the safety of the people and country where there are exemptions to the rule,
wouldn’t the same misinformation on one platform be as harmful on another platform? Why is a
digital platform service specified by the Minister exempt? Should the government and its
employee have more freedom than others under the law?

What are the financial costs of implementing these regulations?

Would there be an independent third party to handle any complaints by the public?

Freedom of speech is the core of human freedom and must remain protected and without any
restriction and/or exemptions.
