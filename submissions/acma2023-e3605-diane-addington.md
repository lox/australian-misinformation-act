Good evening,

I do not agree or consent to this proposed Bill.

Misinformation and disinformation seem to be terms used by people and those in authority who do not want to discuss
any issue with anyone who dares to differ from them, ie used as a verbal weapon to shame people and silence them.

Critical thinking is a positive attribute as is being able to respectfully debate issues of concern.

Democracy is government by the people.

Respectfully yours
Diane Addington
