Subject: I OBJECT TO YOUR DISINFORMATION/MISINFORMATION BILL
To: <information.integrity@infrastructure.gov.au>
Erica RobertsWood

I am emailing you to put in an objection to the new bill that was past on the 25th of June 2023. I find this draft to be totally
against everything our forefathers fought and died for in the past World Wars. How dare you try and stop people having their say
and opinions on line. That is just like what a Communist country would do and may I remind you THIS IS AUSTRALIA. OUR
LAND THATS ONE AND FREE! I TOTALLY OBJECT TO THIS BILL OF DISINFORMATION/MISINFORMATION
PASSING IN THE HOUSE. IT IS NOT HOW AUSTRALIA OPERATES. WE ALL HAVE A FREE MIND TO TAKE
WHAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE WHETHER IT BE MISINFORMATION OR NOT AND DECIDE FOR
OURSELVES WHATS THE TRUTH OR WHATS NOT THE TRUTH IS.WE DONT NEED TO BE PROTECTED OR
RATHER BULLIED INTO HAVING WHATS WRITTEN CENSORED BY ANYONE. DO NOT PASS THIS
RIDICULOUS TOLITARIAN BILL. IT IS NOT HOW AUSTRALIANS DO THINGS. STOP THE BILL.
FROM
ERICA ROBERTSWOOD.
