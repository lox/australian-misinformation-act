economy that the government implies them to be. People in a free society have always had the right to exercise their own powers
of reason, deduction, and communication in accord with what is the birthright of every human being. This proposed legislation
threatens to remove these rights, and will turn our free, diverse society into a dictatorship in which every citizen must believe
whatever the government dictates, under threat of punishment. No, it is not misinformation and disinformation that are the threat!
Legislation such as this is the threat, the lion waiting to pounce, to shred and devour the victim, which is our right to free speech
and a free society. The government ought to be protecting our people from this threat, not from misinformation or disinformation.
