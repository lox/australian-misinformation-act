[Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the Bill mentioned above. The Bill does not clearly define two very important
words, misinformation and disinformation. I'm concerned that this could lead to people's voices being silenced because they
express views that challenge whoever is enforcing the laws. This puts a lot of power in the hands of whoever is enforcing the law.
Preventing Australian citizens from expressing their views concerns me as it seems to push us away from democracy and towards
dictatorship style government. There are already laws in place to protect Australians from serious threats so in my opinion there is
no need for further laws like those proposed in the Bill. I want to raise my children in a society that is peaceful and where people
are respectful of each other. I don't see this Bill as something that will lead to a more respectful society, I just see it leading to
silencing voices. In a democracy we need to be able to question the Government.

Kindly,

Zoe Smigielski
