To Information Integrity Committee,

I write this submission to express my concerns over such an act "combatting Misinformation & Disinformation"

1.a. MP's & Senators take an Oath or Affirmation before God & before Australian Citizens & to hold them accountable to the
Citizens of Australia who they are to serve

OATH: "I, A.B., do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Her heirs and
successors according to law. So Help Me God!

AFFIRMATION: "I, A.B., do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her
Majesty Queen Victoria, Her heirs and successors according to law"

1.b. Our Sovereign who MP's have sworn public allegiance to is by Coronation Oath "Defender Of the Faith" = Judeo Christian
Faith.

1.c. The Law on which our Constitution is founded on gives all citizens the RIGHT of FREEDOM of SPEECH & Freedom of
conscience & opinion.

1.d. The Universal Declaration on Human Rights of which Australia is a signatory & which is legally binding. The UDHR
recognizes the rights enshrined in the UDHR (1948) as basic human rights for all peoples of the world & it clearly states:

PREAMBLE UDHR (1948) "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members
of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of
mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and
want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, ........"

Article 3 "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."

Article 7 "All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to
equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination."

_Article 12 "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to_
_attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or_
_attacks."_

_Article 18 "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change_
_his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his_
_religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance."_

_Article 19 "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions_
_without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of_
_frontiers."_

2. The job of MP's & Senators by Oath of Office is to DEFEND our Constitutional Right to FREE SPEECH - Australian men

land.

3. The very terms "Misinformation" and "Disinformation" are so politicized & misused to cancel opinions of those who have
genuine well founded knowlege & understanding on various social issues!

e.g. A Biology teacher in the USA was suspended from work merely for teaching the Biological Science regarding two genders
& that life begins at conception - That is orthodox fact now being wrongly labelled as "Misinformation / Disinformation"

The UDHR (1948) clearly states:

Article 16:

1. Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found

a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.

2. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.
3. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State"

Article 25:

1. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including

food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of
unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

2. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock,

shall enjoy the same social protection."

e.g. Climate Change - any genuine concerns regarding the Climate Change Narrative are labelled "Misinformation /
Disinformation" - NASA came out publicly stating last year that Climate Change is not man made but due to the Sun, will that be
labelled "Misinformation / Disinformation"???

e.g. There is now a huge amount of Medical & Scientific Data showing the links between excess deaths & vaccine injuries since
the Covid mRNA vaccine roll out - will that be labelled "Misinformation / Disinformation"???

4. The Only Legislation that any MP / Senator should agree to is legislation that upholds FREE SPEECH as per the UDHR
(1948) signed after the worst world war in history during which the Nazi (National Socialist) Government of Hitler's regime
actively shut down Free Speech & as a consequence millions of Jews were murdered!

5. Every Election Year & when partaking in Referendums, Australian citizens exercise their Freedom of Conscience & Choice to
vote in elected representatives - some times we muff it & are saddled with MP's & Senators who forget they are servants of the
citizens of Australia.

6.b. I oppose the ACMA being given "new powers to combat online misinformation & disinformation" The ACMA are not
elected MP's & don't represent me.

6.b. The ACMA has a Constitutional Duty to UPHOLD FREE SPEECH online!

Giving the ACMA more power would violate the UDHR (1948) - thus the ACMA will be guilty of violating the Human Rights of
all Australian citizens!

6.c. Australian citizens want our MP's & Senators to stop being big brother & to stop more over reach.

treated & the messages they were putting out on social media was labeled misinformation during Covid for telling the TRUTH
about mRNA vaccines & now a huge number of Aussies are suffering & dying as a result of the mRNA vaccine:

e.g. My mother had a stroke 2 weeks after having the Pfizer vaccine.

e.g. My sister in law has recently been diagnosed with Cancer of the lymph gland - she also has had the vaccines & boosters.

IN CONCLUSION - I ask the MP's & Senators of Australia to vote against the Bill & do as our Armed forces did in two
world wars & stand up for the defence of FREE SPEECH!

Regards,

Barbara
