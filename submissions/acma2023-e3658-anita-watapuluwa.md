To whom it may concern,

It deeply concerns me that the Government seeks to control the Australian people, through social media companies or any other
way, by limiting what they can say. It is not the role of government to say what people can or cannot say, what they believe or
what they do. Yes, certain laws are good and just, such as the law which says we shall not murder each other. The role of
government is to ensure the people get a 'fair go'. Governments are intended to provide emergency help for those who need it, to
provide and facilitate infrastructure that everybody uses, such as roads, piped, drinkable water, dental care and medical help.
The individual, the citizen, the natural person can decide for themselves what is true. The government is not the owner of truth
and therefore how can it say to the people, "this is truth" or "this is false"?

This government seems to think that Australians cannot (or perhaps should not) think for themselves. How foolish! Because of
over-regulation, Australia lacks innovation, enterprise, ingenuity. Because of over-regulation and governments forcefully telling us
what to think, what to do and where to go or not go, we have division among us! We have lost the ability to respect others for
thinking differently. We have lost the ability to robustly discuss and debate issues. This proposed legislation seeks to exacerbate
this problem!

This proposed bill exempts the government - a collective of Australian citizens, when you break it down - from the law that the
government seeks to impose on the other citizens! This is not fair, and it is not reliable. Again, the government is not the owner of
truth.

During the past three, nearly four, years, the Federal and State governments have told the people that the Covid-19 vaccines, for
example, are 'safe', and yet I know dozens of people who have had the vaccines and have become ill, have constant headaches,
who have developed myocarditis and other health issues since taking the vaccine. The government also assured us that the
vaccine would stop the illness spreading, but how many people have still caught Covid-19?! The Queensland Premier said the
virus would "hunt" people down if they were not vaccinated. I have not had any of the Covid-19 'vaccines' and I have not caught
Covid, and therefore I have not been "hunted" down and the Premier's statement is demonstrably false!! How can we trust any
government to know and tell the truth when we have so many examples of governments here giving false information?! The
answer is, we cannot and do not trust the government.

Please, start listening to the Australian people. We pay the taxes that are asked of us. We work hard in our own parts of the
country, to contribute to society and the world. Please, get back to providing the essential infrastructure we need to live and
prosper and stay out of 'truth keeping', ideological debates and other social issues.

I wholly object to this proposed legislation and ask that the parliament abandon the bill entirely.

Yours respectively,
