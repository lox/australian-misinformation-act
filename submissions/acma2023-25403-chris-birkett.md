This proposed law is un-Australian. Unlike some other overseas nations, Australians have never been prone
to authoritarian ideology, such as Nazism or Stalinist Communism, where dissenting views were not allowed.
As a citizen of this country, I am extremely frightened at the thought that our government could become so
authoritarian as to limit the free flow of information in any way, deciding what the rest of us know and what
we don’t know. What is most disturbing is the proposal to give the government the power to enforce this.

History shows that freer, less restricted flow of information was instrumental in liberating western Europe,
centuries ago, from the authority and ideology of the religious elites, mainly the Catholic Church as it was
then; largely by the invention of the printing press and mass production of cheaper books, so that much more
information became available to the ordinary people. The entire progress of civilization ever since then was
facilitated by the greater and freer flow of information to greater numbers of people, which encouraged
**questioning and dissent** **from what the elites dictated, allowed broader modes of thinking and the**
blossoming of innumerable new ideas by these larger numbers of people; which could never happen when
restricted to relatively fewer elites, even though the religious elites believed they were virtuous, and knew
best. This expansion and sharing of ideas by exponentially more people, led to the remarkable rapidity of
scientific discovery and even better methods of communication and transportation in the years thereafter,
plus significant social improvements, such as the elimination of government sanctioned slavery, the Geneva
conventions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - all of which created the modern world.

As to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; how can you even consider making a law in Australia,
contrary to Article 19 of that Declaration: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
_right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,_ **_receive and impart information_**
**_and ideas_** **_through any media_** **_and regardless of frontiers._**

I strongly believe civilizations will advance, progress and succeed, or stagnate and fail, according to how
much and how free is the information flow to the maximum number of people. If it’s restricted here, in any
way, Advance Australia Fair (as in our national anthem) – is not going to happen.

Please don’t ruin our civilization and our country. Don’t restrict the free flow of information and decide
what information we can or cannot access in Australia.

I have particular concerns about these proposals, where the government will enforce what is misinformation
and disinformation

  - enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to combat
misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could register and enforce

  - allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation), should a
code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and disinformation on digital
platforms

content or posts be removed from digital platform services, I have grave doubts about this because our
**government is already threatening to fine Twitter an enormous fee every day for content that our**
**government disapproves of. Therefore, I have fair reasons to be concerned by our government**
**creating legislation to give themselves any more power in this respect.**

Please don’t pass any law at all that will allow the government to decide and enforce what is information or
disinformation, or limit the sharing of information and exchange of ideas – in social media or any other kind
of media.
