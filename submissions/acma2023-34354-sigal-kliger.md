# I write to oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Bill).
 This Bill is a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of all Australians and residents, and to our democracy, society, and economy.
 I oppose this Bill for the following reasons;
 1. This Bill is a direct threat to free speech, a fundamental right for all humans and a basic foundation of a democratic society.
 2. This Bill will cause harm to the integrity of all Australian’s and resident’s democratic processes.
 3. This Bill will harm the wellbeing of natural conscious free thinking.
 4. This Bill will create and cause mental and physiological harm.
 5. This Bill may deny and hide facts.
 6. This Bill may deny and hide truth.
 7. This Bill allows for government individuals’ personal opinion - from unchecked emotional character baseline - to make decisions upon their belief systems and ideology to determine ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ based on their feelings and grievances, from a flawed and one-sided mindset in the absence of reasonable, balanced thinking. We would not need such legislation if government were balanced and understanding of true democracy.

 8. No government department should be allowed to interfere with anyone’s thinking or expression of thought.

# 9. This Bill denies freedom of all religion’s to preach and worship as it sees fit.
 10. This Bill does not represent all the people of Australia
 and should be put to the people of Australia in the same way as the Voice to Parliament.
 11. This Bill does not define or separate government
 ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ i.e. remember when smoking was touted as good for you, and asbestos, thalidomide, etc were said to be safe?
 12. This Bill does not define the full process and functions of
 end users.
 13. This Bill does not protect individuals from government
 ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’.
 14. This Bill does not allow the absence of foreign powers of
 unelected powers of individuals, foundations, associations or corporations to interfere with the Australian way of life.

 It is my belief that this Bill is dangerous to the people of Australia. It’s disingenuous and I believe has been created to give false public sense of on-line “safety” as a prelude to act as a gatekeeper for Government surveillance and future human controls.
 As the creators of this legislation used free thinking to draft this Bill, using their natural, living human right, so must those be allowed the same rights to oppose this legislation.
 This Bill goes against fundamental, natural, conscious rights of living humans and is not fit for purpose. It is unethical and government overreach.

# The Bill must be made clear to the public for fairness and due process, as this Bill has been disguised. It has not been appropriately nor officially advertised to the public. Wisdom has two sides, democracy has two sides. This Bill is one sided.

 I recommend that this Bill; 1. in its current form be suspended.
 2. be redrafted to include free speech protections for living humans in Australia.
 3. be resubmitted to the public and officially advertised to ensure all Australians are informed of its implications
 4. be vigorously and widely advertised to the public with a wider date range.

 This Bill does not represent living Australians. This submission falls short of proper public consultation as the government is really asking Australians to sign away their rights. The Prime Minister has said he will govern for all Australians and residents, this legislation proves the PM’s comment to be a lie.
 A government that is prepared to censor a different point of view contrary to a government view point or narrative or agenda in the absence of fully informed consent and remiss of proper checks and balances of natural rights of free thinking without discussion and debate is dictatorship, it is not leadership.
 I strongly oppose this Bill. 

 Yours sincerely,
 SIGAL KLIGER 20/8/2023
