Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

## I am a Chartered Accountant and have worked mostly for family businesses. Personally I manage various food
intolerances and health issues and research medical papers and studies. This proposed "Misinformation Bill" is
disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable human right and must be
safeguarded.

The bill states that "misinformation" includes that which leads to `harm', including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
## for their own good. Many foods that are generally regarded as healthy are not "healthy" for me and cause various
painful symptoms. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity and individuality.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
