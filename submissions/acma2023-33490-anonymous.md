**Comments on Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation**
# and Disinformation) Bill 2023

The obvious defect in this bill is its definition of misinformation: unintentionally false,
misleading or deceptive content (emphasis mine).

This is too broad and open a definition. At the very least it presents a threat to our democracy, or indeed to any democracy. To forbid unintentional misinformation is Quixotic at
best, destructive at worst, irrational at any time. To comply with such a provision requires
omniscience and the gift of prophecy. I do not possess these attributes.

The nub of the matter of course is where does (mis)(dis)information stop and start? One
man’s information is another man’s misinformation. Wikipedia tells us that Australia does
not have freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights, except
_political speech. We need a Bill of Rights._

All fields of knowledge progress via conjecture and refutation, hypothesis and falsification.
Journals and websites are filled with debates, arguments, opinions, conclusions false and
true. There is no way to separate out information from misinformation, much less
disinformation, except by encouraging an environment of testing and experience.

In 2003, CSIRO senior scientist Graeme Pearman was reprimanded and encouraged to resign
after he spoke out on global warming. How things have changed!

For decades Alfred Wegener's Continental Drift Theory was regarded as misleading and
ridiculed, until the evidence in its favour led it to being accepted as information rather than
misinformation. Under the terms of this Bill, proponents of Wegener could be regarded as
spreading misinformation and censored.

You might argue that the Bill does not and is not intended to address certain areas and
domains of knowledge and knowledge production. Not so. Consider Trofim Lysenko, a
Soviet agronomist who rejected well-established Mendelian genetics in favour of his own
ideas. After 1940 he became politically powerful and used his political influence to suppress
dissenting opinions and elevate his theories to state-sanctioned doctrine. The consequences
were dire: dismissal of opponents, hundreds imprisoned, a few executed as enemies of the
state; famines and mass starvation in both the USSR and China.

I submit that this Bill opens the door to similar disasters in this country. How can you be
certain that a similar trajectory might not be followed in Australia?

For instance, how might the Morrison government have used the provisions of this Bill had
they been available to them in dealing with critics of Robodebt? Given what I have read in
the news, and in view of the sheer, brazen defiance of Mr Morrison in parliament denying
the truth of the findings of the Royal Commission, it seems highly likely that his government
would have labelled any and all criticism of Robodebt as misinformation, censored it, and
penalised the critics.

I feel that this Bill is intended to re-introduce the censorship abandoned in the early 1970s,
only in a far more onerous and extensive form. The only form of censorship that really
works is self-censorship. It is entirely likely that some future government would decree that
not to agree with some official opinion (or diktat) is a crime.

The scientific method is based on conjecture and refutation, hypotheses, verification, and
theories. If one can’t argue against a proposition – any proposition – then one can’t analyse
it. Obviously, neither beneficial nor harmful propositions would be identified as such. This
isn’t confined to the physical sciences; social sciences are affected also. Politics is a social
science.

Recall Pontius Pilate’s famous retort when examining Christ, “What is truth?” Possibly he
said that because he’d grown up in a multicultural society with a wide variety of philosophies at hand: Epicureanism, Stoicism, Pythagoreanism, and others. In the modern
setting, might this or a future government select one of those as The Truth and criminalise
anyone doubting it, anyone who points out flaws, gaps, lacunae in its reasoning?

One benefit of maturity is that most of us grow in self-control, self-awareness, patience,
being good listeners, humility and gratitude. As very much an outside observer of social
media, so much of what is said on social media seems to reveal just plain immaturity, rash
behaviour, volatile opinions, unthankfulness – and I suspect this is part of what the
proposed legislation seeks to control.

As I presume you are well aware, Plato observed in The Republic that democracies tend to
slide into dictatorships. One of his criticisms of democracy was that it permitted too much
freedom. Is this another notion underlying this Bill: we enjoy too much freedom?

But apart from easy censorship for some future government, the Bill's objectives won’t,
can’t, work. Censorship is a form of policing. The flaw in the philosophy of policing is that it
attempts to enforce upon people from the outside what people should enforce upon
themselves from the inside. Maturity is the key issue. Maturity can usually be gained simply
by aging and life experience, but it can also be gained from education and wise leadership.
Some people mature late or not at all.

**Conclusion**
This Bill is dangerous.

An easy remedy may simply be to replace the word "unintentional" with "intentional."
