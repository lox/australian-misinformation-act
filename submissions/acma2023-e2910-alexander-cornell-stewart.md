###### Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
 Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
###### and Disinformation) Bill 2023. There is no need for it. Scrap it entirely.

(1) My background -1 have good knowledge of political processes, because among my
53 years of mainly Engineering work, I have been a staffer to six MPs (3 in Canberra, 3 in
NSW) including a Minister. I am concerned Australia’s governance processes are declining.

(2) **There** **is** **NO** **NEED** **to** **do** **anything!** The examples of serious harms in my Appendix
below (which comprises quotes from the official Fact Sheet) can all be dealt with by existing
legislation, whether it is the Commonwealth or State Crimes Acts or other laws.
And I question the adjective _“serious”._ These examples are in my view pathetic, and do not
comprise a justification for what I argue below is an excessive and tyrannical proposal.

(3) _^Disruptedpublic_ _health_ _responses”_ is a major reason in the Fact Sheet (below).

But the truth is that federal and state governments proceeded ruthlessly with public health
responses and were not disrupted by appeals to truth, commonsense or logic, and they
proceeded to impose tyrannical, ineffective and damaging things like lockdowns and
mandates, which contravened our fundamental human rights, e.g. in Magna Carta 1215.
It was the governments who were guilty of lies, propaganda, misinformation and
disinformation. Rather than controls on citizens, we need a parliamentary inquiry into the
government’s bad handling of the COVID19 situation (a recent Motion to this effect stalled
on an equality of aye and noe votes       - a future Motion will pass).

(4) **Attack** **on** **Human** **Rights** **-** this proposed **Bill** is the sort of thing that happens in North
Korea or happened in Stalin’s USSR.
The proposed bill undermines **freedom** **of** **speech** by attempting to ‘balance’ that
fundamental right with the notion of combating so-called 'misinformation'. Fundamental
rights cannot be balanced against anything         - they are to be regarded as foundational.

(5) Difficulty in defining **“misinformation”**

Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ is **subjective** and entrusting a
government agency to decide truthfulness raises concerns, of the type that George Orwell
wrote about in his book 1984 where the Ministry of Truth symbolized the Party's belief that
power is the most important commodity that they have access to. And the power over what
people believe (which includes power over the past) is part of that equation.

(6) Censorship         -         - The bill grants excessive control to authorities and will lead to
censorship. If this Bill passes, we could re-name the Australian Communications and Media
Authority as the “Ministry of Truth”

Yours faithfully,

Mr Alexander Cornell Stewart, on the Electoral Roll at
20 August 2023

###### APPENDIX 2 - Background information about COVID mishandling
### My is one of the world’s top experts in DNA and mRNA, having published over 100
papers in DNA and mRNA over the last 40 years in Germany. He was for a while head of
EMBL the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. He told me 3 years ago that the mRNA
vaccines would not work, but that the technology has great potential in diabetes, cancer etc
but ONLY AFTER another five years of research.

I could provide many articles that expose that what the federal and state governments did re
COVID was misinformation/ disinformation/ lies/ propaganda but here are a few :

         - 1 July 2023 Journal of Medical and Clinical Research, by Dr Wilson Sy, “Simpson’s
paradox in the correlations between excess mortality and covid-19 injections: a case
study of iatrogenic pandemic for elderly Australians”. It has a good list of 24 references.

than-keep-you-out-bmj-editors-analysis-of-pfizer-and-modema-trial-data-finds/

         - Hansard of 25 October 2022          - speech by Senator M Roberts includes that a Pfizer leader
admitted two weeks ago to the European Parliament that “the Pfizer vaccine injection
was never tested to see if it would prevent transmission”

         - 3 August 2023 the Senate Education & Employment Committee held a hearing in which
Senator Gerard Rennick et al obtained shocking information from the TGA, Moderna
and from Pfizer’s Australian medical director, Dr Krishan Thiru.
