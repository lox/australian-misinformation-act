Regarding the proposed "Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation" Bill 2023,1 wish
to convey my **strong** **rejection** of that bill and it's principle.

1. The bill suggests that the digital platform providers will create their own rules and
systems on the information it hosts.

a. During the recent pandemic when businesses and organisations were
required to develop their own covid safe plans, we ended up with the most
ridiculous and in inconsistent application of the government's guidelines. We
have proven as a society recently that this is a bad idea and resulted in
massive divisions, discriminations and detriment to the economy.

b. Digital platforms have become alternative and valid sources of news to the
public. This should not be censored by a government-provided filter.

c. The Australian government was able to place warnings on certain digital
content to inform viewers of a link to true sources of information. Eg the
note from the Aus government at the bottom of youtube videos that talked
about vaccination. This should be the maximum allowable interference from
government.

2. I believe society works best with a minimum level of rules to guide it. Otherwise we
become an over-governed nanny state and freedoms become unnecessarily
restricted.

3. People should decide which sources of news they will accept not big government or
big business. Everyone is always required to filter and discern the validity of
information being conveyed.

4. Putting the power of censorship into the hands of business and government is
fraught with risks. Who decides what's in and what's out? How are they supervised
to ensure they are not being influenced by other interests? Are these people elected
into these roles?

5. I don't believe it's the government's job to meddle with information censorship.
Communist China shows the extremes that eventuate when the government
becomes the arbitrator of truth. That is scary to me. Canada has also succumbed to
legislation changes that result in information censorship around elections. This is a
massive deviation from the society's roots and free speech.

6. I recognise the entertainment industry has a "code of practice" that informs viewers
of the nature of the content eg "PG", "M" or "MA", which is a helpful guide. You
could rate digital platforms like this, but I don't believe government or business
should have the power to control content. If the proposed Bill was applied to the
film and television industry, it would chop scenes, change words or ban movies!
Digital platforms are also valid sources of news and information, and this Bill would
potentially control the information that ordinary people could access. This is not ok
with me.

7. A good example of this issue can be seen with Twitter/X in the USA. It has now been
exposed that big business and big government has been underhandedly controlling
content available to the public that supports their own agendas. I see the proposed
Bill leading us down that same path.
