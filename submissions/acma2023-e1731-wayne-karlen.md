**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**
**Comments on the Exposure Draft Bill**

Pursuant to this legislation, ACMA will judge whether relevant content contains information that is false,
misleading, or deceptive and whether it is serious after considering several criteria.

That judgement in this legislation will, to a large degree, rely on the character of the ‘independent’
ACMA members, which the government tends to control since ACMA members are appointed by the
Governor General (in all probability as recommended by the Commonwealth Government, who also
appoints the Governor General) and the Commonwealth Government itself. Instead of the tradition of
relying on the wider community to debate and expose false, misleading or deceptive information, this
legislation will put the power to judge ‘the truth’ into the hands of a few government appointed
individuals. That power will include forcing the appearance of individuals (paragraphs 18(3)(d) and
19(3)(d) without travel compensation, except for copying documents in paragraph 20) and issuing huge
fines.

There are many recent examples of content that has been judged by government and/or mainstream
media which has later turned out to be the opposite.

If ACMA would rule against the State and Commonwealth Governments and their agencies that their
adoption of emission targets for a non-existent ‘climate crisis’ resulting in the destruction of Australia’s
energy market and competitive advantage leading to seriously harmful energy poverty and serious
commercial and private economic harm, then the legislation might be considered fair. Governments are
unfairly exempt from this legislation and are entitled to lie and deceive. However, even if not exempt, I
expect that rather than listening to geophysicists like myself[1] and 2022 Nobel Physics Laureate Dr. John
Clauser[2], ACMA would favor the ideological opinion of an uneducated Swedish teenager and unelected
European communist/socialist leaders when determining the ‘truth’ for the purpose of this legislation.

If ACMA would rule against the Prime Minister and his Government for attempting to deceive and
seriously harm the Australian public by making false statements that the ‘Uluru Statement From The
Heart’ is only one page long, that treaty-making will be left to state governments and that no work will
commence on Makarrata until after the referendum, then the legislation might be considered fair.
Governments are unfairly exempt from this legislation and are entitled to lie and deceive. However,
even if not exempt, I expect that rather than reading the twenty-six page Uluru Statement From The
Heart[3], listening to speeches made by the Prime Minister that contradict each other, understanding that
Makarrata is treaty negotiation process with the Commonwealth Government and examining actual
Makarrata expenditures that have been made prior to the referendum, ACMA would still favor the
government’s political position.

If ACMA would rule against the State and Commonwealth Governments and their agencies that inflicted
serious harm by banning the prescription of Ivermectin and other available drugs for treating Covid-19 in
order to justify emergency approvals of an experimental mRNA vaccine compounded with forcing
people to choose between keeping their jobs or taking those experimental vaccinations that have a
relatively high risk of serious harmful side effects without the benefit of preventing transmission[4], then
the legislation might be considered fair. Governments are unfairly exempt from this legislation and are
entitled to lie and deceive. However, even if not exempt, I expect that rather than looking at the
evidence presented Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA process, or evidence collected by former


-----

Member of Australian Parliament Craig Kelly and current Australian Commonwealth Senators Matt
Canavan and Malcolm Roberts, ACMA would still favor the government’s ideological position.

Government deceit and lies cause serious harm to children (gender policies based on fiction and turning
a blind eye to domestic violence in indigenous communities based on fictional ‘stolen generations’) and
serious harm to real women (gender policies based on fiction) but are unfairly exempt from this
legislation.

I could go on. It is politicians, governments and their agencies that need to be held accountable to the
truth, but instead they are creating another instrument to control the speech of Australian citizens and
residents. There are already too many laws and regulations curtailing free speech; Section 18C of the
Racial Discrimination Act is one example.

Democracy is not possible without free speech and this legislation represents an attack on democracy.
Furthermore, this legislation together with a government agenda to move towards a digital currency will
form a strong foundation to implement an anti-democracy ‘social credit’ scheme like the one imposed in
communist China.

This legislation must be rejected in full to preserve free speech and democracy.

Sincerely,
Wayne Karlen
