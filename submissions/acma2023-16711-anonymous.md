I believe that granting ACMA extensive powers to decide what information may be

published may have serious implications for freedom of speech, media independence, and

democratic values

Misinformation and disinformation are immense challenges in today's digital age.

However, it is crucial to approach these issues in a manner that upholds the principles of

openness, transparency, and accountability. Granting ACMA excessive powers without

adequate checks and balances could potentially lead to overreach and the stifling of

legitimate expression, diverse opinions, and public discourse.

Empowering ACMA with the authority to determine what qualifies as misinformation and

disinformation raises concerns about potential biases and subjectivity. The interpretation of

these terms can be subjective and vary depending on individual perspectives, cultural

contexts, and political ideologies. ACMA's expanded powers might inadvertently lead to the

suppression of certain viewpoints or the propagation of an official narrative, undermining

the pluralistic nature of our democracy.

An increase in regulatory powers for ACMA could create a dampening effect on

media freedom and investigative journalism. Journalists and media organisations play a

crucial role in exposing truths, holding power to account, and providing necessary scrutiny.

Granting ACMA broad powers to combat misinformation and disinformation could

discourage critical reporting and investigative journalism out of fear of potential regulatory

action, thereby compromising the media's ability to fulfill its democratic function.

The expansion of ACMA's powers raises concerns about the potential for excessive

censorship. The line between misinformation and disinformation on one side and legitimate

dissent or alternative narratives on the other can be blurry. The risk of inadvertently

suppressing valid information and dissenting voices is a real possibility when regulatory

bodies possess unchecked powers. It is essential to strike a balance between combating

misinformation and preserving the right to freedom of expression.

It would be more appropriate to focus on promoting media literacy, critical thinking,

and digital literacy education. By investing in public awareness campaigns and educational

initiatives, individuals can be empowered to navigate the digital landscape, identify

misinformation, and make informed decisions. Encouraging media outlets to adhere to

robust journalistic standards and facilitating independent fact-checking organizations can

also contribute to addressing the issue at its root.
