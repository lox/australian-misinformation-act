I wish to register a strong objection to the proposals presented in this policy
document. There is no shortage of historical examples of the appalling abuse of
power to the detriment of the masses when the prevailing ‘authorities’ get to
determine what constitutes ‘truth’. We currently have government ‘experts’ that can
barely define what a woman is and yet we are about to allow these same
bureaucratic peers to attempt to corral the inscrutable and slippery meaning of ‘truth’.
Pontious Pilate was unable to get the answer he wanted to this conundrum and yet
our increasingly detached and vested interest political operatives are going to be
allowed to pontificate what constitutes correct speech. The ‘expert’ class has not had
a particularly good record of late.

Churchill declared, “truth should be protected by a bodyguard of lies” and Stalin’s
said, “We don't let them have ideas. Why would we let them have guns?” both of
these statements indicating that the control of ‘the narrative’ has forever been a
paramount political consideration. Even when the ‘narrative’ is patently false (as is
being increasingly demonstrated in ongoing parliamentary debates and scandals on
covid protocols - see Boris Johnson’s resignation and the current revelations of the
Australia Covid Senate inquiry) and the now thoroughly disproven “Russian
collusion” in American elections, it has ALWAYS been the operational modus of
tyrants to altogether control what is discussed and argued in the public sphere.
Lennin’s Pravda enforcers and Mao’s struggle sessions proselytists demonstrated
the brutal suppression of dissenters even when the error of their ideas was
increasingly evident. Mao’s ill- informed “sparrow plan” was but one example of the
disastrous consequences of allowing one all powerful voice to determine ‘truth’.

The recent suppression and coercion in which opinion, news, comedy, music,
commerce, art and association has been curtailed over the last few years is
astonishingly evident. From the artistic (J.K Rowling) the religious (Israel Falou), the
political (Julian Assange), the medical (Robert F. Kennedy), the philosophical
(Jordan Peterson) to the scientific (Peter Ridd), dissenters are under relentless and
zealous attack from the often-ignorant narrative gatekeepers. I genuinely believe we
are witnessing a return to the days of “blasphemy” idiocy and the likes of Luther,
Galileo and Paine would readily recognise this perverse and evil development. I am
truly astonished that our ‘leaders’ are unable or unwilling to defend open and
unreserved speech, which has been a fundamental and vital underpinning of
democratic freedom in Australia.
