# I strongly oppose the proposal of this amendment granting powers to the government to combat misinformation and disinformation. 

 Stop this Bill!

 The answer to bad speech is more good speech. NOT CENSORSHIP! 

 Granting a sweeping powers to government to combat misinformation and disinformation gives it the license to become the arbiter of truth, create a so-called ’ministry for truth’ or a ‘ministry of lies’ depending on perspective.

 Under this draft to Combat ‘Misinformation and Disinformation’ the government is specifically exempt from being held accountable for misinformation and disinformation it may spread. This is a very dangerous precedent as evidenced by Government actions in history.

 Government misinformation/disinformation:

 A terrorist attack by Al-Qaeda on the twin towers(US) was used as a premise to launch a bloody war in Iraq and against Sadam Hussein. 

 John Howard lobbied Australian citizens to foot the bill to go to war and kill millions of Iraqi civilians.  Spreading misinformation about weapons of mass destruction and Al-Qaeda. 

 Sadam Hussein had no links to Al-Qaeda nor did Iraq possess ‘Weapons of mass destruction’.

 The use of words as euphemisms, inoffensive synonyms, anodyne bureaucratic jargon and political correctness serve to socially manipulate the masses into passivity and compliance.

 Govt: “We nee more surveillance to stop terrorism’

 What this really means is more surveillance is needed on law abiding citizens to satisfy a governments need to grow and take action with less resistance.

 Who is the arbiter of truth? Government? Where does government get its power? Does Government work for the people or do we work for the government? Considering Government wants to decide who the purveyor of truth is and who is not, are they acting in contravention of their role? Is this oppression?
