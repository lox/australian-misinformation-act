# New ACMA powers to abuse “the people” restricting their right to free speech and effectively deal with Government misinformation and disinformation

## To whom it may concern,

As an example of misinformation and disinformation there can be no better example than the so
called “Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and fact sheet”. Many of the reasons given
for the bill are opinions masquerading as fact, and “Misinformation and disinformation”
themselves. I just call it for what it is deception and lies.

The statement “Misinformation and disinformation spread via digital platform services is a major
issue worldwide” is an opinion masquerading as fact because that statement implies that the lies and
deception only come from those who are not on their so called trusted sources list. This is
reinforced by the list of “list of excluded content for misinformation purposes.”

**Government exempts itself**

This legislation exempts the government itself, bodies funded by government and organisations
with a vested interest from scrutiny. This is immoral and a breach of the ICCPR let alone the
constitution and our common law rights.

The list of excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the following:

a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire;
b) professional news content;
c) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited by any of the following:

i. the Commonwealth;

ii. a State;
iii. a Territory;
iv. a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as an accreditor of

educational institutions;

d) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited:

i. by a foreign government or a body recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor
of educational institutions; and

ii. to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable Australian educational institution;

e) content that is authorised by:

i. the Commonwealth; or

ii. a State; or
iii. a Territory; or
iv. a local government.

**Government, Government agencies and Departments - Lies and Deception**

Government, Government Agencies and Departments and our political leaders are inherent liars.
They are the spreaders and sources of deception, misinformation and disinformation. It doesn’t take
much to find a myriad of examples even though google tries to suppress such searches:

One cannot get over the abuse by governments in Australia of “the people”. The federal government
and federal health authorities enabled that abuse, and Labor obviously supported that abuse as we
see in all Labor states. All based on lies, and the lies still continue.

Another example of the lies is given in this article below. How many people got vaccinated? I look
at my own personal experience and people I know, and compare that with the statistics produced by
government, but then news.com.au does a survey, only 45% had any sort of COVID-19 vaccination.

Here is yet another example of lies. Here is our beloved Prime Minister lying.

“Powering Australia will create 604000 jobs by 2030. Five out of every six of them in Regional
Australia reducing power prices by $275 by 2025, $275 dollars a year, $275 a year. We'll get power
prices down by 275 dollars a year.” Anthony Albese and various government speakers from
“Anthony Albanese made it into government from ‘lies’” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuBmjaFVE 3:20 mark.

There are many such lies. Government makes a habit of it. There are web sites dedicated to it:

  - https://www.laborlies.com.au/

  - https://www.crikey.com.au/dossier-of-lies-and-falsehoods/

It’s not just politicians that lie. Government departments are full of lies and misinformation. The
Bureau of meteorology, Climate Change advocates puts out new lies and misinformation at least
monthly. There is always the latest scare campaign. They even distort the information to ‘validate’
their claims, and there is plenty of evidence to support that.

The list of examples is endless.

**Discrimination on the basis of religion, political or other opinion**

In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) Australia agreed that each State
Party to the Covenant would undertake to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory
and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of
any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
origin, property, birth or other status.

But here the Australia Government is doing exactly the opposite. The Albanese government is
enacting laws to discriminate against those who are of a different religious, and political or other
opinion.

You can’t argue that we won’t do it if it’s not a lie, when the Government promotes lies on a
continuous basis.

The Commonwealth Government agreed when they ratified the ICCPR “to where not already
provided for by existing legislative or other measures, each State Party to the present Covenant
undertakes to take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional processes and with the
provisions of the present Covenant, to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to
give effect to the rights recognised in the present Covenant.” The Commonwealth Government has
consistently refused to do this. Even those laws they have implemented apply to others and
governments in Australia exempt themselves. This legislation is a point in fact. It applies to others
and not to itself. It dismantles free speech.

**We have no effective remedy**

The federal government has not ensured ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as
recognized in the ICCPR which have been violated have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that
the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity. This legislation is such
an example. The court system as it currently stands in Australia rarely if ever stands for justice
when it comes to imposed legislation, whether it conflicts with the constitution, other law, or
agreements such as the ICCPR. Furthermore the court system is so costly it in itself inhibits justice.
This legislation only allows appeals on things the government says are reviewable. As specified in
Schedule 9, which I cannot find. Administrative Appeals tribunals are often just a tool of
government and once again we get down to the opinion of a single person. Again it is one person
against the might of government and the situation is inherently biased in favour of government and
what ever they want verses what the people want.

The court system and the Administrative Appeals Tribunals in Australia are a far cry from the courts
envisaged in the constitution:

**Sect 80: Trial by jury:**
_The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and_
_every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was_
_not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament_
_prescribes._

**Public health responses**

The citing of “disrupted public health responses” is one of the most offensive things in the fact
sheet. Governments in Australia mandated coercive laws, had whole states effectively under house
arrest, lied to us about “safe and effective”, and our society is still suffering the effects of those so
called “safe and effective vaccines”, when they were anything but. They lied about the necessity for
lock downs and restriction of travel. They lied about the supposed severity of the so called COVID19.

**My Basic Response:**

My basic response to this legislation especially after the last three years is one of anger and
contempt.

  - Governments of Australia are untrustworthy and corrupt.

  - Governments of Australia no longer (if they ever did) serve the people.

  - The governments of Australia are consistent and practised liars.

  - The courts cannot be trusted

  - The police cannot be trusted


-----

We reject this legislation. We do not agree. We do not consent. We will not comply with such
outrageous self serving “laws”. We will do everything within our power to ensure that people are
free, free from government continuous breaches of human rights and our rights as free men and
women.

Sincerely
