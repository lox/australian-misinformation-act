# Statement on the proposed ACMA powers to combat

 misinformation and disinformation

The proposed ACMA powers aimed at countering "misinformation" and "disinformation" raise

a number of significant concerns.

Most individuals would concur that "misinformation" (information that is contradicted by facts)

and "disinformation" (the intentional spread of misinformation to further an agenda) are

problematic or dangerous in principle, and I understand the attraction to try and “keep them

in check”. However, I’m afraid that there may be equally problematic and dangerous side

effects of any such endeavour.

At the core of this matter lies a fundamental question: Who gets to decide what qualifies as

"misinformation"?

Certain assertions, like the assertion that "the Earth is flat," can be readily disproven with an

abundance of supporting evidence. However, the accuracy of numerous other claims

remains less clear-cut.

Fields such as health and climate science, among others, continually evolve through fresh

experiments and studies. Robust discussions occur among field experts, often yielding

widely differing perspectives from the same data. In reality, many contentious issues cannot

be definitively labeled as "settled," even within the scientific community.

Indeed, the truth behind complex matters often can only be established through rigorous

academic and public debate.

This brings up a critical issue with classifying views as "misinformation," where a viewpoint

might hold legitimate scientific merit but is rejected due to its unpopularity.

There are several famous cases of this through history;

1. Ignaz Semmelweiz, who advocated for the importance of handwashing by doctors to

prevent the spread of infections in hospitals. His ideas were met with skepticism by

the medical community and were initially rejected. It took many years for the medical

establishment to acknowledge the validity of his claims, during which he was labelled

as a crank and unfortunately passed away in a mental institution. The misinformation

of the day.

2. Rachel Carson, an American marine biologist who documented how common

pesticide were accumulating in ecosystems and causing disruptions to the food

chain, leading to declines in bird populations and other wildlife. She faced strong

opposition from the chemical industry and other groups with vested interests.

Carson's work was criticized as alarmist and her credibility was attacked. Another

“conspiracy theory” of the day.

3. Physician John Snow, who during the 19th century proposed that contaminated

water was responsible for the spread of cholera, contrary to the prevailing miasma

theory that attributed diseases to "bad air." His findings were initially met with

skepticism, as he challenged the “settled science” of the day.

There are other famous cases where conflicts of interest in particular hampered the spread

of knowledge, namely that of smoking of Tobacco and also Lead in paint and gasoline.

In both cases government bodies were slow to act on the emerging health risks due to

effective industry lobbying.

There is also the inherent risk that bodies which police misinformation will never act against

their own interests, such as when affiliated bodies spread disinformation to further their own

agendas. Who watches the watchmen?

Such biases are systemic and should be addressed with careful checks and balances, such

as political independence, and diverse incentive structures.

The concept of “red teaming”, where part of a project team takes an adversarial role to the

other (the “blue team”) and challenges their thinking in order to make it stronger, and also

the overall project more likely to succeed, is instructive here.

Furthermore, people from diverse backgrounds and political and social views can further

enrich the conversation with their own perspectives, and provide additional equipoise.

At the end of the day, my primary concern is that some of the "harmful" beliefs of their time,

if properly debated instead of stifled, could have contributed greatly to saving lives and

improving outcomes, and may still do so in future crises.

In summary, even considering that discord among viewpoints can lead to harm, entrusting

one entity with policing internet information or overseeing acceptable information standards

for organizations is equally perilous. The harms of misinformation are undeniable, yet a more

nuanced solution is required, as the lines of misinformation are not as easy to draw as they

first appear, and the carte blanche suppression of alternative views can lead to yet greater

harms

Remember the adage that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” but consider that sunlight still

allows new plants to grow, which makes for a healthier garden in the long run.
