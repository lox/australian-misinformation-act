Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Hi
This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a
non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
