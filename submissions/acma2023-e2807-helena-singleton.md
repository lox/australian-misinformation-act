The criteria by which ACMA plans to determine what is misinformation or disinformation is not clearly
defined. It is very vague. What is meant by "harm" is vague and not clear and it seems like it could be what
does not conform to "the political narrative".

Scientific knowledge is never settled, it is always evolving and should always be open to discussion. (I have
a background of studying science. I have completed a Bachelor of Science).

The prevention of discussion and sharing of information is essential for intellectual freedom and scientific
advancement. This is an essential part of being in a democratic society. This constitutional freedom is
implied in the Australian Constitution. The High Court has affirmed that intellectual freedom is a big marvel
of living in a democracy. It brings huge benefits to society.

It become clear over the past few years that financial interests and conflict of interest was linked to the
medicines such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine being demonized. The false message about their
safety was put out to the public because of a conflict of interest of pharmaceutical companies and lack of
financial benefits.

Because of these financial conflicts of interest, trust in medical research and the medical systems has been
eroded and that erosion of trust will seriously continue if the proposed bill comes into effect.

Accordingly, because of that erosion of trust, conflict of interest and democratic societal values, and the
importance of scientific discussion, I advise the passage of this bill.
