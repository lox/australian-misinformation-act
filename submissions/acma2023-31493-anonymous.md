As a medical practitioner who has seen the devastating effect on patients’ health from the
suppression of medical opinion by government authorities during the Covid pandemic, I am opposed
to the draft Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill. I believe it should be fully
withdrawn. Well-intentioned or not, the effect of this amendment would be devastating for freedom
of speech and for freedom of scientific and political debate in Australia. It would result in far greater
harm to our society than any ostensible harm this Bill seeks to prevent.

The current draft Bill proposes to grant unprecedented powers to a Commonwealth Government
authority (ACMA) and private digital platform companies (Big Tech) to police and suppress
information posted on social media platforms.  In our current digital age, social media platforms
have become the public square in which ideas are debated, information is exchanged and scientific
discourse takes place. This Bill is thus a manifest attack on freedom of speech.

Our western system of liberal democracy is founded on the principle that freedom of conscience,
freedom of thought and freedom of expression are inalienable rights. The free exchange of ideas is
essential to intellectual debate and scientific progress, which has created unprecedented material
development, prosperity and human flourishing to our society.

In science, there is no such concept as ‘truth’, ‘misinformation’ or disinformation’, only hypotheses
that are tested and re-tested based on empirical observation and interpretation of all available
evidence.  Many groundbreaking scientific discoveries were historically made by individuals who
questioned the dominant scientific ‘truth’ and orthodoxies of their day – from Galileo to Einstein and
our own Dr Barry Marshall. The idea that any government, authority or private corporate interest
can determine what constitutes ‘truth’, ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ – defined in this Bill as
‘false, misleading or deceptive’ information – is ludicrous. It can only mean that, if this Bill is
enacted, ACMA and Big Tech can arbitrarily determine what constitutes permissible content. Such a
centralised approach to controlling speech will accelerate the concentration of power to a global
elite establishment by suppressing criticism and silencing opposition, all at the expense of ordinary
people’s freedom, sovereignty, progress and innovative potential.

One need look only at very recent history to understand the danger of this flawed concept. The
‘twitter files’ have shown that governments, intelligence agencies, corporate media and social media
conspired to an unprecedented extent during the Covid pandemic to censor medical and scientific
voices who argued that lockdowns would cause disproportionate harm to society, that cloth masks
do not stop virus transmission, that the mRNA shots do not stop Covid transmission or infection, and
that early treatment with Ivermectin – a cheap, TGA approved medication with well-established
safety profile – is very effective in reducing Covid infection risk. Each of these statements has been
validated by peer reviewed science and is now no longer censored. It would be no exaggeration to
state that countless lives have been unnecessarily lost by the misguided policy response to the
pandemic, which was allowed to occur due to suppression of free scientific debate.

If as a society we want to further our quest for the truth, we need access to more and better
information in a free marketplace of ideas, not from a singular source that claims to have unique
ownership of the truth. A necessary step might be to distinguish social media posts created by

humans from those created by bots or artificial intelligence, but otherwise there should be no reason
to flag or restrict online speech.

The concept of ‘harm’ that this Bill is seeking to prevent is so broadly defined that it essentially
means any disagreement with a social media post.  The concept of ‘serious harm’ is not adequately
defined and therefore meaningless. This lack of clarity can be easily exploited and weaponised for
political purposes, which a cynical person might perhaps see as the real purpose behind this Bill.

When we already have established laws against defamation, incitement to violence and exploitative
online content such as child pornography, it is not entirely clear why new legislation is needed for our
protection against online speech. History shows that authoritarian regimes have always justified
censorship under the guise of public safety, asserting that it is necessary to protect people from
harm.  It reveals a patronising contempt for the ability of individuals to use their own intelligence
and judgement to accept, reject, ignore or act on any given information.

Benjamin Franklin, a founding father of the American Constitution, famously said: “Those who would
give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety”.
Unfortunately, Australia has no constitutional freedom of speech protection like America’s First
Amendment, but this Bill would clearly be in breach of its principles.  Current US presidential
candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr recently summarised the critical importance of free speech in a
congressional hearing on state censorship, as follows:

_“The framers of our constitution knew that democracy was a very inefficient system, that it had all of_
_these built in inefficiencies and difficulties, but they felt that the one thing that would give us an_
_advantage over totalitarian systems was this capacity for the free flow of information and a complete_
_lack of controlled debate, so that ideas that would eventually mature into policies would be annealed_
_in a furnace of debate and then rise through the market place of ideas rather than being dictated_
_from above. And that’s what would give the energy, the vibrancy, the vigour to democracy. When_
_they invented this democracy, we were the first one in the modern era in 1780. By 1865, five other_
_nations had imitated us. Today, it’s 190 nations based upon our system. We are supposed to be the_
_exemplary democracy and the corner foundation stone of our system is freedom of speech. All of the_
_other freedoms depend on it. If we lose that not only do we lose our democracy in this country but_
_the entire world loses us as an example.”_

There is a very real risk that we will lose our Australian democracy should this Bill come to pass.
Anyone wishing to avoid global totalitarian control by an unelected, unaccountable ‘censorship
industrial complex’ should vehemently oppose this proposed legislation.

Thank you.
