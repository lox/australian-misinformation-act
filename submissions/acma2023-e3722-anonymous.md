Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

The proposed 'Misinformation Bill’ is wrongheaded and dangerous.

Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because
it’s easy to see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Meta said that the law would have a “chilling”
effect on free speech. It would be easy for a government to label as “misinformation” anything that could hurt its
reputation (as many authoritarian governments already do). Giving the government such unrestricted power is
terrifying.

Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false.
We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this
vital process.

It’s easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found
inconvenient. The proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed. This is especially the
case after the COVID mandates and 'vaccines' have injured thousands and killed hundreds, vastly in excess of
COVID itself, revealing the existing censorship by the MSM. Voting in the Misinformation Bill renders this defect
abysmally worse than it is.

Please reject this proposed law.
