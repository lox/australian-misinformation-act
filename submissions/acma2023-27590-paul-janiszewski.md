Response to new proposed ACMA powers.

Paul Janiszewski

1*. Government censorship poses a threat to the safety and well being of all Australians, as well as
our democracy, society and economy. The misinformation disseminated by our government and
medical authorities in lockstep with equvalent jurisdictions worldwide, as a response to the so called
"Covid Pandemic" attests to the incompetence of such institutions and may construe a response that
illuminates criminal negligence or indeed a response of deliberate attempt to harm. The evidence
for such a conclusion has systematically and deliberately been censored and silenced by
governments and medical establishments world wide. Critical evalutaion of the evidence by
scientists, medical practitioners, doctors, virologists, epidimiologists, statistitians etc which
questions the mainstream narrative is overwhelming and yet there is no concession for legitimate
and free scientific debate, nor a serious investigation into the covid response. Instead our
governmentand jurisdictions intend to double down on their attempts to silence debate and free
speech for which evidence and speech that it deems, does not conform to its agenda. The
"Communication Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023"
is representative of that very same push by those in power to consolidate its censorship of
alternative views and legitimate scientific debate.

2*. The "Communication Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023" is in effect an attempt to take control of information with the purpose of consolidating a
narrative that the Australian Government deems true and correct, and in likely disregard and denial
of any truthful critical evidence, science or opinion that does not fit its predetermined agenda (an
agenda of ignorance). In other words the Australian Government is legislating to be the final and
unquestionable arbiter of "science","fact" and "truth" based on the experts, scientists and available
evidence it deems to be truthfull and factual whilst excluding the experts, scientists and evidence
that may present an alternative reality. The powers of the proposed said amendments, in essence,
would grant government the right to define, without full scientific and public debate the meaning of
1. "misinformation", 2. "disinformation" and 3. "serious harm". These terminologies are central to
the understanding and definition of the concepts of "fact" and "truth" which are ostensibly
understandings that must remain out of the power of any limited jurisdictional body, but instead be
a collective understanding based upon the will and understanding of the people as a whole. These
understandings should never be subject to such a limited and closed jurisdiction and finality of
meaning nor subject to the discernment of those few in power. History attests to the agregious
misuse of power by governments and their media propaganda agencies leading to dire and
destructive consequences, as already demonstrated during the recent pandemic response. Once
again the cry of "the better good" had been hijacked to erode individual human rights and in direct
contradiction to the moral an ethical principles as enumerated in globally accepted charters of
human rights and in particular to those clearly and unambiguously stated in the Nuremburg Code.

3*. The "reserve powers" of the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) which
pertain to ramifications that can be construed as being potentially constrictive, msleading and a
power to control is 1. the power of government to deem "industry efforts inadequate". A case could
be made that a peer reviewed scientific study that contradicts government agenda is "inadequate"
and therfore nullified. In effect and by extension providing government a sole right of power to
enforce government decree regardless of merit. 2. the power to "gather information" pertaining to
industry or individual. Such powers wield potentially destructive totalitarian control over society in

all aspects and avenues similar to the social credit system that has arguably enslaved the people of
China. Such powers are the antithesis of a so called "free" society.

4*. In conclusion a truly free and democratic society must balance the rights of the individual with
the rights of the collective. Each has a responsibility to each other and as a result the correct balance
may be achieved. The individual is bound to follow and respect the rules and laws of the collective,
and in return the collective is bound to protect the rights of the individual. The "Communication
Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023" disrupts this
delicate balance by writing into law an erosion of the rights of the individual, and effectively creating
an authoratative governing body with powers that potentially reach into every aspect of individual
and collective life. It is to be condemned in every way, and by every breath of each individual lest we
become the very society that led to the horrors of the holocaust.
