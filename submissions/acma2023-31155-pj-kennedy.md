Dear Sir/Madam,

SUBMISSION

New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)

I hereby make this submission in response to the exposure draft of the
"Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023".

**This is the essential part of my submission: in a free and democratic country**
like Australia, every person has the right to form their own opinion about an
issue. That opinion may be correct or it may be erroneous. But they are entitled
to their opinion, and to express that opinion in public including on digital
platform services on the internet.

**It is clear that the government seeks to use this bill to prevent free speech in**
**Australia. I do not accept the government's claim that much of the information**
by so-called "conspiracy theorists" about the COVID-19 situation since 2020 has
been misinformation and disinformation. Let us be clear: those you accuse of
being conspiracy theorists are simply people who disagree with you. These are
people who care deeply about their inalienable rights to privacy and bodily
autonomy.

Of course, there has been some misinformation and disinformation from some of
these sources. But by and large, it has been "information", something that this
bill has failed to define.

Despite the efforts of the Australian Governments to vilify, ridicule, cancel,
and censor anyone who dared to question their interpretation of the COVID-19
situation, many Australians have not been convinced. We did our own research. We
found the people who were qualified, whom you also vilified, and we have come to
our own conclusions.

The best way to encourage people to change their opinion is to give them the
opportunity to hear an intelligent debate, in which each side of an argument is
given a chance to present their facts and have their voice heard. It is not up
to me or to the government to be the arbiter of what opinions are acceptable and
what opinions are not.

The Australian Constitution created a parliament the encourages robust debate.
Whenever a piece of legislation is proposed, it is debated. In Australia, we
have a history of being sceptical about governments, and for good reason. The
government of the day is elected to serve the people. If they are not serving
the people, but are, in fact, harming or ignoring the people, then that
government does not deserve to endure.

**I have a number of concerns about this bill, which I will expand upon below. I**
**have also made a number of recommendations:**
1) It will severely restrict freedom of speech on the internet in Australia.
2) Its definitions for misinformation and disinformation are woefully


-----

inadequate.

3) It claims to be motivated by a desire to reduce the incidence of “harm”,

yet it does not define that term clearly either.

4) It is missing a definition for “factual information”.
5) The Bill sets up ACMA (i.e. a branch of the Australian government) as an

arbiter of truth for content on digital platform services.

6) The bill puts too much emphasis on forcing digital platform services to

censor the users on their platform.

7) ACMA does not have to accept the industry codes.
8) The bill gives ACMA quasi-judicial powers to “gather information” and

impose penalties for non-compliance.

9) It exempts certain parties from the requirements of the bill.

**It will severely restrict freedom of speech on the internet in Australia.**
The vague and all-encompassing language used to frame the bill casts a wide net
that will catch many ordinary people who are simply trying to express their
views and share information.

Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. Article 19 of that covenant says:
"Article 19
1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.
2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds,
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of
art, or through any other media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article
carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject
to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and
are necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public),
or of public health or morals."

Note that it says “and are necessary”. Not to be tampered with because someone
took offence. Not to be curbed because the government or a politician didn’t
like what you said. “Necessary”, meaning that if it is essential, and that with
a clear and present danger, temporary changes may be made. And then these rights
must be restored in full when the danger has passed.

Recommendation: Use this bill to enshrine in Australian law clear rights and
safeguards to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of association,
and freedom of religion. With these in place, the bill is set to clarify the
extremely rare and unusual instances in which it would be necessary to curtail
these rights for the protection of national security or of public order (ordre
public), or of public health or morals.

**Its definitions for misinformation and disinformation are woefully inadequate.**
The bill defines these words in Subclause 7:
“Subclause 7 Misinformation and disinformation
(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital
service is misinformation on the digital service if:
(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and
(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation
purposes; and
(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in
Australia; and
(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to
cause or contribute to serious harm.

(2) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital
service is disinformation on the digital service if:


-----

(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive; and
(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation
purposes; and
(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in
Australia; and
(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely”

I deal with some of my other concerns later, but the main problem here is that
there is nothing to compare mis- and disinformation with. So I will suggest a
way to do that.

**It needs a definition for “factual information”**
I will include another definition, as I consider it critical to this debate:
"factual information". This is data that has been obtained from reputable
sources. It may be from a peer-reviewed study from a scientific or professional
journal. It may be statistics from publicly available sources such as the
Australian Bureau of Statistics, or the Queensland Department of Health. It may
be an analysis of a situation by a highly-respected and qualified person in
their field, such as a PhD cardiologist, an embalmer of 20+ years' experience,
or a welder who specialises in pressure vessels.

This is information that can be checked and verified for authenticity. However,
in certain highly specialised fields, such as, perhaps, quantum mechanics, only
a person with similar qualifications can verify some types of information. This
is why professional associations have journals with peer-reviewed articles. It
is not good enough for just any old "fact-checker" to check some of these facts.
The checker must be qualified to do so, and must be free from accusations of
improper pecuniary interest.

Even one of the Fact Sheets about this bill puts the term “evidence” in
quotation marks as an attempt to derogate persons who have supposedly posted
misinformation, whom they might also call “conspiracy theorists”. Who can we
trust to determine what is “truth”? Even in science, no science is settled. At
best, science can propose theories that are more or less reliable. Professional
journals exist as forums for scientists to share their findings and allow others
to check their findings. Sometimes there are very important advances in our
knowledge, but rarely, if ever, could it be said that the scientist has
discovered “the truth”.

In the realm of philosophy, there are numerous points of view. To suggest that
one’s world view is the epitome of truth is a high call indeed. Short of
opinions that encourage criminal behaviour, or incite others to directly hurt
others, a plurality of opinions are to be expected. Discussion, debate, argument
or sharing of information. These things help us to sharpen our own opinions and
cast aside those that we have considered and found wanting. And by and large,
this is a good thing for our democracy.

Recommendation: Include in the bill a definition for “factual information” (or
similar term). This would clarify what type of information would be considered
acceptable and would clarify the boundaries of when the information becomes
misinformation.

**It claims to be motivated by a desire to reduce the incidence of “harm”, yet it**
**does not define that term clearly either.**

It speaks of “harm” that a person’s views may have on our people, our democratic
institutions and even our economy. Yet it does not clarify how a person or the
economy may be harmed by those views. The meaning of “harm” has been diluted in
recent years to include “causing offence”. For some people, to simply have
someone express an opinion that is opposed to theirs is enough of an affront to
constitute “causing offence”. The rise of cancel culture attests to this.
If we are to acknowledge that Australians have a right to freedom of speech,
then it follows that we must acknowledge that they have a right to express views


-----

that we do not agree with.

There is a difference between being offended, and being harmed. I have certain
beliefs that many others do not agree with. However, just because someone states
their disagreement with me, I do not consider that a case of causing me harm. In
fact, I welcome robust discussion and healthy debate about important issues. It
is essential to our parliamentary democracy that, in proposing a bill, that
different points of view are brought to bear on the details of the bill.

As per this very submission, Australians must be given the opportunity to hear
different opinions for any issue. It helps others to crystallise their own
opinions, identify fallacies or mistruths in a given argument, and clarify
details and ammendments for a proposed law. I don’t hear about our politicians
crying “harm!” every time someone expresses a view at odds with their own. We
must not constrain the definition of harm so tightly that it loses its meaning
and is used to justify stifling legitimate discussion and debate over important
issues.

Recommendation: Define the term “harm”, and do it in such a way that it would
only include such things as criminal behaviour or incitement to cause immediate
physical or emotional harm to a person. It must be so clearly defined that the
minister or bureaucrat responsible for taking action can easily determine if the
language used constitutes something that is harmful.

**The Bill sets up ACMA (i.e. a branch of the Australian government) as an arbiter**
**of truth for content on digital platform services.**
It gives too much power to politicians as well as unelected bureaucrats to
determine what constitutes misinformation and disinformation. Let us not think
that a government or a subsidiary body of it, is capable of being an arbiter of
all that is good and true. The government can make laws, but it cannot be
considered the final word on “truth”.

**The bill puts too much emphasis on forcing digital platform services to censor**
**the users on their platform.**
This will lead these digital platform services to self-censor,lowering the bar
even further for freedom of speech. Given the potential penalties for failing to
censor posters on their service in accord with ACMA’s vague and loosely framed
codes and standards, I expect that these digital platform services will selfcensor so that they err on the side of caution. This will lower the bar even
further for freedom of speech. Opinions that would be considered valid by ACMA
standards will be removed to avoid even possible breaches of the codes.

Recommendation: Any codes or standards for mis- and disinformation must so
clearly define misinformation and disinformation that it is easy for a provider
to determine if a user has breached the code. Typically, the type of
misinformation would involve criminal activity. It would also allow members of
the public to make complaints, knowing that their complaint was valid given the
parameters of the code. Service providers would find it easy to determine if a
complaint was justified, as it would be clear whether or not the code had been
breached.

**ACMA does not have to accept the industry codes.**
The bill proposes that ACMA requires digital platform service providers to
develop their own codes to deal with misinformation and disinformation. Yet it
does not have to accept those industry codes. The way it stands, ACMA could
reject the voluntary industry codes as inadequate, and then force its own codes
or standards on the service providers require that they implement them.

Recommendation: If ACMA considers it necessary to reject industry codes, it must
clearly explain, immediately, the nature of the concern and how the industry
codes are inadequate. It must give suitable notice (e.g. 90 days) for the
service providers to self-remedy the breaches.


-----

**The bill gives ACMA quasi-judicial powers to “gather information” and impose**
**penalties for non-compliance. As I am not a lawyer, I will quote the human**
rights lawyers at Maats Method. About Division 3 of the bill, they said "...even
the protections available to defendants in the criminal charge and hearing
process are not afforded to digital platform providers (which again, can be
individuals) under this Bill. The provision of this unbounded quasi-judicial
authority subverts the rule of law and common law rights, while granting to ACMA
a star chamber-like authority not afforded under the Constitution." (ACMA
Submission (Maat's Method and ASF),23 July 2023)

Recommendation: Clearly set limits on the powers that ACMA has to gather
information, call evidence and impose penalties. It must be in accord with other
similar non-judicial bodies and must be subject to the rule of law and common
law rights.

**It exempts certain parties from the requirements of the bill.**
“Professional” media, and governments of all levels do not have to be concerned
with the information that they publish online, because they will not be subject
to the bill’s penalties. Yet who is to say that these organisations can be
trusted to always post “factual information” statements, if they are not
subjected to the conditions of the bill. As per my statements above, no one
person or party has the final say as to what is truth.

Recommendation: No parties shall be exempt from the bill. If it is to be
enforced, it must apply to all persons and parties. No one gets favourable
treatment under the law.

Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission. As it stands, this bill
is unworkable. It is dangerous to the rights and freedoms of ordinary
Australians. Ideally, it needs to be scrapped altogether or almost completely
rewritten. If it does go into law, it will be a dark day for Australia and
especially for ordinary citizens. I urge you to reject this bill as unsuitable
for a free and democratic society.

Yours sincerely,
Paul Kennedy
