Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Subject: Submission on Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concerns and outrage regarding the draft bill titled "Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023." It is my firm belief that the existence of this
bill undermines the freedom of speech that is so vital to Australian citizens. I firmly assert that this bill has the potential
to disproportionately harm regular citizens, those who make up the backbone of our democracy, and stifle their voices
in the online sphere.

One of my main concerns with this bill is the creation of two classes of citizens. The first class, consisting of
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions, will be granted the power to spread information,
regardless of its accuracy. However, the second class, comprising ordinary citizens who often possess more
knowledge on various topics, will be left at a disadvantage. This unjust classification disregards the fact that the
internet is a powerful democratic tool that has given voice and agency to regular people. This bill puts this voice at risk
and goes against the principles of equality and fairness that underpin our democratic society.

Furthermore, the excessive fines outlined in the bill will only serve to make digital services more restrictive in their
approach to speech, potentially surpassing even the most stringent restrictions currently in place. The lack of
"pressure escape valves" within the system compounds the harm that will be caused. It is an impossible task to
accurately discern what is true or untrue, as the nature of knowledge is constantly evolving. Historical examples, such
as the ever-changing understanding of COVID-19, highlight the dangers of attempting to regulate and remove content
based on accuracy. This legislation has the potential to silence legitimate and varied viewpoints, inhibiting open and
honest discussions that are crucial for a robust democracy.

The bill not only targets provably false information but also extends to information that can be deemed "misleading" or
"deceptive," thereby endangering freedom of speech. Freedom of speech plays an invaluable role in facilitating open
and honest debates, allowing for the exploration and establishment of truth through critical discourse. Even experts,
such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer, have expressed serious concerns about the
broad scope and implementation of this bill, further undermining its credibility.

Moreover, the proposed delegation of legislative power to private entities, such as the creation of Misinformation
Codes, raises constitutional concerns. By allowing these entities to register such codes that become law without direct
responsibility to parliament, the bill represents an unconstitutional abdication of parliamentary legislative power. The
power granted to the ACMA to enact Misinformation Standards and Digital Platform Rules also infringes upon the
implied constitutional freedom of political communication, which is vital to a healthy democracy.

Additionally, this bill assumes that the government and accredited institutions possess the sole authority to determine
what is true, disregarding the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians. Diversity in viewpoints is essential
to the sense-making process and to consider all possibilities. By deplatforming certain views before they can be
shared, this bill eliminates the necessary diversity in perspectives, hindering informed decision-making and
undermining the very essence of democracy.

Furthermore, the threats made to both digital platform providers and ordinary users, referred to as the "Deplorables,"
are deeply concerning. These threats, including negative reports, impositions, and civil penalties, may cause
significant harm, both reputationally and financially. By coercing compliance and potentially requiring ordinary people
to report on their friends or family, this bill promotes an environment reminiscent of oppressive regimes, contrary to
the values of mateship and integrity that are cherished in Australian society.

Lastly, the bill jeopardizes the democratic endeavor by categorizing political party viewpoints as misinformation and
allowing for their removal from digital platforms. Independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers face


-----

As a founding member of the United Nations and a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Australia
has committed to upholding fundamental rights, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and freedom
of opinion and expression. This bill poses a direct threat to these rights and perpetuates an atheistic worldview while
neglecting the diverse perspectives of people of faith.

In conclusion, I implore the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the
Arts to reconsider the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023. This bill not only undermines the freedom of speech of Australian citizens but also fails to address the crucial
role of diversity and open debate in a thriving democracy. I urge you to protect the democratic values and freedoms
that Australians hold dear and ensure that any legislation promotes transparency, accountability, and the unrestricted
exchange of ideas.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the concerns raised and take
appropriate actions that align with the democratic principles upon which our nation was built.

Yours sincerely,
