To whom it may concern.

I am responding to the opportunity to express my views on the draft bill                - Communications Legislation
##### Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023) and whether it strikes a balance
between tackling harmful online misinformation and disinformation while balancing freedom of speech, with the
independent regulator ACMA being given new powers to do this.

After studying the information provided I have grave concerns about the issue of freedom of speech and expression,
and the penalties that could be imposed for non-compliance or for providing online platforms as an avenue for
authoritative debate and information sharing, and the potential for escalating censorship and the undermining and
stifling of the underlying principles of freedom of expression and speech in our democracy. It is stated in the reasons
for extending these powers that misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and well being of
Australians as well as to our democracy, society and economy.

I am very concerned about the development of this notion and the direction this is leading with the expansion of
powers to a so-called independent authority, for it looks to me like a slippery slope towards the censorship and stifling
of debate and independent thought and expression, the erosion of the "scientific method" which welcomes vigorous
discussion of ideas and the freedom to do so without the threat of punishment if they are not subservient to the status
quo or the prevailing narrative.

I have a very basic concern about the conception of what is information, misinformation and disinformation. Who
decides on behalf of everyone else, what is true and what is not??? Upon what evidence are such conclusions
drawn??? Who takes it upon themselves to feel they have a monopoly on the truth and feel they have a right to
impose this upon everyone else. Who decides what is harmful? Who thinks that they have more authority to draw
more accurate conclusions based on information provided in the public arena than each individual citizen who is
interested in the information provided on these online platforms. When information is openly available, and those who
wish to share information either through interest or by those who have the authority and expertise to speak, it can be
scrutinised and debated openly. It is a very lazy intellect that seeks to censor and suppress rather than use the
opportunity to present an intelligent critique or counter argument and to expose incorrect statements by data and
evidence that is available.

I am seeing more and more censorship in Australia and around the world, and in particular of the media and
investigative journalism, that social media has become the only outlet for sharing information on some subjects that
governments and political parties with vested interests would rather the people did not have access to. This
oppressive trend can be seen in many places in the world where despotic governments use fear of punitive measures
and even imprisonment to suppress any criticism of the regime or its politics or performance.

Disinformation is a very frequently used tool here and in oppressive regimes to orchestrate the narrative and opinions
of the people. A relatively recent example I remember is the Tampa affair and the children overboard disinformation
used to influence the outcome of an election. What about the coalition of the willing to accuse Iran of manufacturing
weapons of mass destruction which were never found and the propaganda and sending armed forces into the middle
east to disrupt the region. And more recently, there is so much information from qualified doctors and researchers that
was attempted to be squashed and discredited during the recent disruption to our society, our lives and economy
during the "pandemic" and the ongoing harm that many citizens are still experiencing at many levels.

I think all decent citizens would already agree on what is obviously harmful content                - illegal hate speech based on
religious and racial discrimination and abuse, child sex abuse and pornographic exploitation, terrorist content and
incitement to violence. We already have strenuous legal capabilities to deal with these matters in the criminal law and
there are state and federal authorities working 24/7 to track down the perpetrators and to prosecute accordingly. The
eSafety Commissioner already has the power to require digital platform services to remove adult cyber abuse content.
I feel the extension of powers in other realms is the open door to totalitarianism and an opportunistic censorship which
could be exploited for political advancement by powerful and influential vested interests and this is not in the best
interest of democracy or for the health and well being of Australian citizens.

The growth of a healthy progressive society and democracy allows and is dependent on vigorous and rigorous
debate, without fear or favour, the sharing of information and testing the information to derive greater understanding
of any issue of human concern so positive progress in any part of life can be made. This process would facilitate and
deliver greater success in the economy, in environmental concerns, medicine and health. I feel the enforcement
penalties contained in this bill, especially for individuals, will have the effect of stifling debate by invoking fear to
participate in the healthy discourse that I have discussed above and are not in the interests of a healthy and thriving
democracy. I find them to be extreme and draconian.
