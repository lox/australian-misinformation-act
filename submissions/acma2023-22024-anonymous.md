The proposed bill suggests that ACMA will have no role in determining the truth of statements, but
that it will "allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of
regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and
disinformation on digital platforms." I simply cannot see a way to reconcile these statements. Truth
is fundamental to the definition of mis/dis-information (as is acknowledged in the bill). How could it
possibly be determined that a code of practice has been ineffective in combatting mis/disinformation on a platform, without first determining the truth of one or more statements made on
that platform?

This bill serves as evidence that the government views its citizens as children who require protection
from their own ability to interpret the world they live in (as if such evidence was necessary). The
guidance notice for the bill states that "the proposed powers seek to strike a balance between the
public interest in combatting the serious harms that can arise from the propagation of
misinformation and disinformation, with freedom of speech." The right balance is for the
government to keep their arrogant, self-righteous hands out of public discourse. We do not need
you to sanitise our conversations for us.
