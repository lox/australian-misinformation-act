**Submission in Regard To:**

**New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation**

To whom it may concern, I wish to voice my sincerest concerns with regard to this bill.

As a citizen of Australia, I find it incredulous and dismaying that we are heading in the same direction
as other nations with dictatorship government.

This bill is an attack on freedom of speech, the terms used are so broadly defined and so nebulous
that no one will know if they are guilty of hate or not.

As always seems to be the case, it is the secular left activists who are pushing for such laws, and it
will be these people who will use them to the max extent of the law.

These laws are all one-way traffic. Currently in Australia it appears that the group most hated on is
the Christian community, you would expect that they would get protection, however legislation like
this will NOT be used to protect them – it will be used to further discriminate against them. I believe
that to be a fact.

Harm and “hate speech” is in the eye of the beholder. In this case it will be the secular lefts of the
State deciding this. We already know what they mean by these terms. It doesn’t seem to take much
to ‘offend’ someone today. If a Christian for example says that Jesus is the only way to heaven, or
only heterosexual married sex is morally licit, then the communicators of such comments will
immediately be in the PC cross-hairs.

Take for example the terms, “sexual orientation” it is so very open-ended that if a platform features
concerned parents not wanting their children taken away from them and being mutilated for life as
in the trans scenarios, they could be punished with a 7 million dollar fine simply for doing what they
believe is their right as parents to protect their child.

These are the possible outcomes of this Bill.

Who decides what is dis/mis information? The Government and the people who control what they
do and say behind the curtain do. The same types of people who told us that Covid-19 mRNA
vaccines were safe and effective and that Covid was deadly when it was in fact mild for almost 100
percent of healthy people.

I repeat, this bill is dangerous. Free political speech is the bedrock of our society and I will fight to
preserve this right. The Government should not be controlling speech. If we as a society are worried
about dis/mis information then the best disinfectant is freedom of speech not more Government
censorship.

Sincerely,

Federico Merlo
