To the Australian Government Representatives & ACMA,

In my respectful opinion, freedom of expression in private messages to individuals should be
excluded in the Bill's scope on these platforms: interactive podcasts; instant messaging; social
media; private message groups & web forums. Policing an individuals private thoughts &
communications is a step too far towards despotism. Protect individuals private choice of
engagement with content.

Public messages should be within scope, not private messages.

Penalties to corporations profiting from deception should be 10% of their gross yearly income as is
implemented elsewhere overseas. However 10,000 penalty units & /or 3 years imprisonment for an
individual is too much, I propose 1,000 units & 1 year is more fair & just.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.
