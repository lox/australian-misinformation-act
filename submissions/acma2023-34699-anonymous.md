### Regarding the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng
 Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Act 2023

“… a na�on that is afraid to let its people judge truth and falsehood in an open market is a na�on
_that is afraid of its people”._

John F. Kennedy, 35[th] President of the United States of America

[Remarks on the 20th Anniversary of the Voice of America; Department of Health, Educa�on, and Welfare, 26 Feb 1962]

Feedback has been sought on specific aspects of the Dra� Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment
(Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Act 2023 (henceforth referred to as “the Bill”). This
Bill grants powers to the Australian Communica�ons and Media Authority (ACMA) to take certain
ac�ons if it determines that digital pla�orm industry efforts in regard to misinforma�on and
disinforma�on are inadequate.

Modifica�ons to the aspects of the Bill upon which feedback has been requested amounts to nothing
more than �nkering around the edges of what is, at its core, not only a censorial instrument, but
one that paves the way for online dissemina�on of only narrow ideological and poli�cal narra�ves
to the exclusion of dissen�ng views - at the expense of truth.

## Reasons for introducing the Bill[1]

### Hold Big Tech Companies to Account for Content
In any other context, the individual, or the organisa�on, is responsible for what they say, write or
do. A digital pla�orm is not responsible for the content produced by its end users any more than the
manufacturers of paper are responsible for the words printed upon it. It is simply easier to impose
compliance rules upon digital pla�orms because that is the en�ty that can be iden�fied, and,
arguably, one of the greatest faults of digital pla�orms is that they allow anonymity of their end
users.

Social media and other digital pla�orms have been described as a modern ‘Town Square’ where
ideas have been exchanged freely, un�l recent years. The intent of the Bill clearly isn’t to hold the
right people or groups to account, but to coerce digital pla�orms, through threats of financial
penalty and imprisonment, to censor content and thus control the messaging on the single most
powerful medium for informa�on dissemina�on available today.

### The growth of misinforma�on and disinforma�on erodes trust in democra�c ins�tu�ons
There has been widely reported mistrust in democra�c ins�tu�ons, and the events of the Covid-19
era are a good example.

_“During the COVID-19 pandemic, rampant disinforma�on and misinforma�on on social_
_media undermined public health efforts to contain and treat the virus. More than 4 in 5_
_Australians reported having experienced COVID-19 misinforma�on in the 18 months to June_
_2021.[2]”_

The statement quoted above makes a valid point – there has been content expressing differing points
of view regarding public health messaging and ac�ons rela�ng to Covid-19. Any Australian who used
online pla�orms in the 18 months to June 2021 will have experienced Covid-19 misinforma�on.
Much of it was produced by Australian democra�c ins�tu�ons and elected representa�ves.
Examples of such falsehoods include:

  - _The wearing of face masks is an effec�ve protec�on against Covid-19._

`o` The lived experience of many Australians was that masks didn’t prevent infec�on with

or transmission of the illness caused by the Covid-19 virus.

  - _The Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effec�ve._

`o` What health data shows, and has since been acknowledged as a known phenomenon,

is that the mRNA vaccines can cause myocardi�s and pericardi�s, par�cularly in
young men.

`o` The vaccines are not effec�ve at preven�ng infec�on with or transmission of the

virus. Despite high vaccina�on rates among the Australian public, Covid infec�ons s�ll
occurred in the thousands. Further messaging from the Department of Health[3] stated
that the Covid-19 vaccines provided significant protec�on against infec�on,
transmission and severe disease from earlier variants, but despite lack of vaccine
efficacy against Omicron, vaccines con�nue to provide significant protec�on against
disease. This asser�on is not supported by data such as the NSW Health Covid-19
Weekly Data Overview for the two weeks ending 31 December 2022[4] which shows a
correla�on between increasing numbers of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and separately,
increasing age, with increasing numbers of admissions to ICU and deaths.

`o` Thousands of vaccine injuries have not been acknowledged by public health

authori�es. Some of these injuries present as neurological disorders resul�ng in lifechanging disabili�es and financial hardship for many Australian families.

  - _Lockdowns were necessary to keep the public safe from Covid-19._

`o` Lockdowns did not prevent infec�on with or transmission of Covid-19. Eventually, the

CCP, which has no compunc�ons about using any means to control the popula�on,
abandoned lockdowns as a measure to control the spread of Covid-19 because of the
damaging impacts upon the Chinese economy.

To suggest that the presence of misinforma�on and disinforma�on on social media undermined
public health efforts to contain and treat the virus is unjust. The vast majority of Australians did

exactly as they were told during the 18 months to June 2021 and beyond. There was a high
vaccina�on rate and most people acted according to lockdown and curfew rules most of the �me. If
the measures imposed upon Australians didn’t have the desired outcome it is because the measures
didn’t work rather than because of the presence of content that was in opposi�on to the authori�es’
narra�ve.

The reasons for the erosion of trust in Australian democra�c ins�tu�ons following the Covid-19 era
is no mystery. Public ins�tu�ons have betrayed the trust of Australians by dissemina�ng material
which contradicted peoples’ lived experiences and enforced ac�ons which resulted in nega�ve
consequences, some of which are s�ll being played out and will con�nue to do so for decades to
come. Evidence to support the extreme health-related Governmental policy decisions throughout
2020-2022 has not been produced.

Statements were issued by some Australian democra�c ins�tu�ons as if they were fact, when
common sense should have made it clear that some things could not have been known at the �me,
e.g. that Covid-19 vaccines were safe and effec�ve for the broader popula�on, even though they
had only been in existence for a short period.

This Bill will not only fail to help Australian democra�c ins�tu�ons to regain trust but will deepen
the mistrust in them.

The way to gain trust is to be trustworthy. Tell the truth.

### The growth of misinforma�on and disinforma�on causes harms to individuals and businesses
The digital landscape is a mixture of views and opposing views, useful content and useless content,
truth and falsehood, advice on anything from self-help to violence and destruc�on, material from
trolls and good Samaritans and everything in between. End users of digital pla�orms may choose to
act upon something they see on the internet, the same way they can choose to act upon something
that is read in a book or heard in a conversa�on. That is the choice of the individual for which they
must take personal responsibility and own the consequences.

If the Australian educa�on system is robust enough, the popula�on will have the tools to be able to
make decisions for themselves think though the consequences of their own ac�ons.

Examples of harm that it is expected the Bill will address are[5]:

  - Hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, na�onality, race, gender,

sexual orienta�on, age, religion or physical or mental disability

  - Disrup�on of public order or society in Australia

  - Harm to the integrity of Australian democra�c processes or of Commonwealth, State,

Territory or local government ins�tu�ons

  - Harm to the health of Australians

  - Harm to the Australian environment

  - Economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the

Australian economy

-----

Examples of serious harm are:

  - Misinforma�on about a group of Australians inci�ng other persons to commit hate crimes

against that group

  - Misinforma�on that encouraged or caused people to vandalise cri�cal communica�ons

infrastructure

  - Misinforma�on undermining the impar�ality of an Australian electoral management body

ahead of an elec�on or a referendum

  - Misinforma�on that caused people to ingest or inject bleach products to treat a viral

infec�on

  - Misinforma�on about water saving measures during a prolonged drought period in a major

town or city

  - Disinforma�on by a foreign actor targe�ng local producers in favour of imported goods

The greatest poten�al for harm is when governments force or coerce people to act upon untruths,
as the State has Law Enforcement, and other instruments, at their disposal. There are numerous
examples where governments have made bad decisions, based upon incorrect assump�ons or
informa�on, that have created widespread personal, poli�cal, public health, economic or
environmental harm.

Examples of historical harmful consequences of government policy include:

  - The starving of millions in the USSR with the Soviet famine of 1930-1933 following the

implementa�on of Stalin’s collec�vist farm policy;

  - China’s one child policy, which ran from 1980 to 2016 in an a�empt to limit popula�on

growth, and has resulted in issues including propor�onally greater numbers of elderly people
and fewer younger people to support them, a shrinking workforce, skewing of the sex ra�o
such that there are more males than females and therefore fewer females available for
marriage and millions of males without a female partner, and a significant drop in fer�lity
rates to below replacement value;

  - Argen�na’s raising of wages without commensurate raising of taxes or increase in

produc�vity in the la�er half of the 20[th] Century, excessive government spending and a high
foreign debt to GNP ra�o, prin�ng money and other ac�ons compounded to produce an
infla�on rate of around 100% p.a. and interest rates of up to 97% p.a. in 2023.

An example of government ac�on that caused harm to individuals and business in Australia occurred
during the Covid-19 era. The lockdowns caused suffering for many Australians who endured
experiences such as decima�on of businesses, loss of employment, inability to earn a living and
subsequent financial distress, diminished mental health, diminished physical health and wellbeing,
loneliness and damaged socialisa�on through social isola�on, removal of ac�vi�es and interac�ons
that give meaning to peoples’ lives, inability to access goods due to supply chain disrup�on, gaps in
educa�on, and many other forms of suffering not listed here. In many cases these consequences will
con�nue to be felt and/or manifest themselves for decades to come. The economic impact of the
expansion of Australia’s sovereign debt will be felt for genera�ons to come.

This Bill would not have prevented such harm from occurring, but would, instead, have exacerbated
it.


-----

It is the job of Government to take mul�ple factors into considera�on when determining how to
address a par�cular problem. Focusing on a unidimensional issue, that being deaths due to Covid19, the governments of many Western countries, including Australia, u�erly failed their ci�zens by
not making allowance for the impact upon their mental and broader physical health, social needs
and a plethora of other aspects, as well as the economy, supply chains, etc.

The imposi�on by government of ac�ons that caused harm to Australia and Australians has added
to the mistrust in Australian democra�c ins�tu�ons.

## Excep�ons from the ACMA’s Code and Standard-Making Powers
Excep�ons from the ACMA’s code and standard-making powers are:

1. Content authorised by the Australian or a, State, Territory or Local Government,
2. Content produced by a professional news source that is subject to par�cular recognised

industry standards, codes of prac�ce or similar rules and has editorial independence from
the subjects of the news source’s news coverage,

3. Content produced by or for an accredited educa�onal ins�tu�on and
4. Content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or sa�re.

Holding Government bodies to a different standard around the dissemina�on of material paves the
way for propagandist ac�vity, removes any expecta�on of jus�fying their policies and ac�ons with
evidence and s�fles opposing argument despite what is true and what is false.

Governments make mistakes, too.

## Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on 
For the purposes of the Bill, the defini�ons[6] of misinforma�on, disinforma�on and harm are as
follows:

  - Misinforma�on encompasses content that contains informa�on that is false, misleading or

decep�ve, and that the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to
cause or contribute to serious harm.

  - Disinforma�on incorporates misinforma�on but with the intent to deceive.

  - Harm includes hatred against any group in Australian society, disrup�on of public order or

society in Australia, harm to the integrity of Australian democra�c process, harm to the
health of Australians, harm to the Australian environment, and economic or financial harm
to Australians, the Australian economy a sector of the Australian economy.

Conspicuously absent from the Dra� Bill is the defini�on of ‘truth’. In fact, the word doesn’t appear
anywhere in the text of the Dra� Bill. In order to correctly iden�fy misinforma�on and
disinforma�on, the truth, or at least part of it, must be known.

### Truth and who possesses it
There are many issues that are the subject of discussion and argument within Australian society and
poli�cs today. They are deep and complex. They cannot be accurately summarised in brief. They do
not have simple solu�ons, and there is not consensus on them.

6 h�ps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publica�ons/communica�ons-legisla�on-amendment
comba�ng-misinforma�on-and-disinforma�on-bill-2023 subclauses 7(1), 7(2) and 2.


-----

The truth is not necessarily a binary of true or false. It is complex, nuanced and takes �me to
ascertain. The no�on that the whole truth of any ma�er is absolute and known at any point in �me
during its explora�on is flawed – there can be informa�on that comes to light a�er a protracted �me
period that can completely change previous percep�ons about the truthfulness of the ma�er. Such
is the nature of poli�cal, historical, scien�fic and other complex topics that society grapples with
today.

When deciding whether something is true or false, �me frame needs to be taken into account.

The truth can only be determined through inves�ga�on, research, discussion and debate via the
free-flowing, open exchange of ideas amongst lots of individuals – over �me. It may take months,
years or even decades to discern fact from fic�on.

The Bill does not take into account the nature of truth, the process of finding it or the �me required
to discover it.

### The Arbiter of Truth
The Dra� Bill[7] and its suppor�ng documenta�on, the guidance note[8] and the fact sheet[9], are cra�ed
to state that the ACMA will not be the arbiter of truth, nor will the ACMA’s powers include the ability
to request that specific content or posts be removed from digital pla�orm services. Rather, the
ACMA’s powers will be to:

_“…enforce industry codes or make industry standards to encourage pla�orms to be_
_ambi�ous in addressing the harms of disinforma�on and misinforma�on. These will_
_provide ACMA with the ability to hold pla�orms to account should their voluntary efforts_
_prove inadequate or un�mely.[10]”_

To paraphrase, the threat by the ACMA of pecuniary penal�es and incarcera�on will be used to
coerce digital pla�orms to censor content. Furthermore,

_“A Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on Ac�on Group will be established, bringing together_
_key stakeholders across government and the private sector to collaborate and share_
_informa�on on emerging issues and best prac�ce responses.[11]”_

Nowhere amongst the documents related to the Bill is there an explana�on of how misinforma�on
or disinforma�on will be iden�fied, the �me frames over which such determina�ons will be made
and revised, the responsibili�es or charter of the Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on Ac�on Group
(MADAG) or the make-up of that group.

The method of iden�fica�on of misinforma�on and disinforma�on is further confused by the
following:

_“The ACMA may inves�gate poten�al breaches of codes or standards made under the Bill._
_Complaints about systemic or a regular pa�ern of misinforma�on or disinforma�on on a_
_service may be a trigger for the ACMA to inves�gate a digital pla�orm provider’s_
_compliance with a code or standard.[12]”_

It is highly unlikely that the truth about complex issues can be possessed by any single en�ty, be that
en�ty an individual person or an organisa�on, but it is distributed across mul�ple such en��es. To
assign the authority to be the arbiter of truth to a single en�ty is not likely to result in the accuracy
of the determina�on of what is true and what is false.

How the ACMA will ascertain the adequacy of the systems and processes that pla�orm providers
have in place to combat misinforma�on and disinforma�on[13] is unclear. Perhaps the ACMA will rely
on the MADAG – a group of unelected individuals with backgrounds and qualifica�ons that are
unknown to the Australian public and the selec�on process of which is also unknown. Perhaps the
ACMA will rely upon complaints from end users by pla�orms or the ACMA: whether the number or
content of complaints is used to determine the adequacy of pla�orms’ systems and processes for
dealing with misinforma�on and disinforma�on, or inves�ga�ons as to whether the complaints are
vexa�ous, uninformed or genuine will be conducted, is all unknown.

Material that reflects truth will inherently stand up to scru�ny and will have evidence to support it.
Material that does not reflect the truth will be shown for what it is through debate in the public
domain and lived experience. If the publishing of any asser�on is met with suppressive penal�es
such as fines, incarcera�on, defunding, depla�orming, “cancella�on” or threats of these and similar
acts upon the author, publisher or pla�orm, it suggests the inability or unwillingness of those
opposing the asser�on to debate or legi�mately disprove the asser�on.

The truth will speak for itself.

## Conclusion
Threats of pecuniary or other severe penalty ins�ll fear in those who would otherwise speak up
about an issue of concern or weigh in on a discussion. This is a tac�c of totalitarianism.

This Bill paves the way for totalitarian control over the modern-day Town Square.

George Orwell’s “1984” is a warning, not a blueprint. It is a literary work that does not end with a
posi�ve outcome – it paints a picture of a dystopian society in which no reasonable person would
choose to live.

For the sake of Australians and the future of Australia, this Bill cannot be allowed to pass.

13 Where voluntary efforts provide inadequate protec�on and the ACMA is sa�sfied that it is necessary to address
systemic issues in rela�on to misinforma�on or disinforma�on on digital pla�orm services, the ACMA will be able to
request the industry make a new code. That code will become mandatory and enforceable following registra�on. [from
