Patricia, Kahler.

To whom, it may concern, @,
Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Developement, Communications, and the Arts.

My Submission, to, The New ACMA Powers, to Combat, Misinformation and Disinformation (The
Communication Amendment (the communications legislation amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
## Disinformation) Bill 2023.

This, Misinformation and Disinformation Bill, Greatly Concerns Me, as it, could stifle, robust, and open
debate, on social media, on issues, that are, of great importance, to people, and communities, and, may, leave,
regulators, and regulations, to decide, what is truth. Truth is Factual.

We, have, Seen, Social Media, Posts, being Censored, as Disinformation, by Fact Checkers, and People,
being, Banned, from Posting, for Set Periods, of Time, or People, Being Shadow Banned, Using Algorithms,
to, Put your Friends, and Families, Posts, Further Down, Daily News Feed. Many of the Censored Posts, are,
Now, Proven, to be, True. Social Media, Should, be a place, to Discuss, hot Topics and Issues, Openly. You
## May Find, That, We, Would, Censor Ourselves, If, we were, Left Alone, To, Make, Our Own Decisions, and,
Be Able, To, Call Out, Deception and Lies, Without, Censorship. Most People, are, Capable, of That, And,
Are, Kind, Good, and Courteous, Law, Abiding, Citizens.

## Our Own Government, are guilty, of Misleading the Public, or, Just, Rubber Stamping, Documents, And/Or,
Trusting, In, Other Authorities, And Regulators, Say So. This, Was, Done, Seemingly, Without, Proper
Scrutiny, During The, "Covid19 Pandemic” Era”, As It, Is, Now, A, Well Known, Fact, that, Pfizer, Did Not,
Test, The Covid Vaccines, For Transmission, Prior To Marketing. So Our Government, Making, Statements,
like, "Take it, To Protect Others" is, Now, Proven, To Be, False, and, Misleading, Misinformation.

This is, Just, One Example, Of, How, Censorship, IS, Stifling, Robust and Open Debate! Effecting People’s
## Perception, Their, Points Of View, and, The Discussions, and Decisions, That, People, Make!
This kind of Censorship, Has Already, Possibly, Led, To, Many More Deaths, Through, Chaos, and Mass
Hysteria, With, a Fear Based Campaign, To Control, The Discussion, And, People.

I believe, That People, Have, Real, and, Rational, Minds, And Are, Quite, Intelligent, Enough, To, Decide for
Themselves, after, Gathering Information, and, From, Many Angles, Are, Quite Able, To Make Their Own,
Decisions, With, Reasoning, and Logic, and BE, Allowed to, Without, Government, Overreach.

We, Were, Reasoning, a long time before, Social Media, Began, With Open Discussions, and Research, to
Make Our Own, Decisions. Freedom, of Speech, Freedom, of Expression, and Freedom, to Associate, IS
## Essential, to a, Democracy. Living, and Free Speech, Is, our, God Given Right, At, Birth, as long, as,
IT IS, Respectful, and Non Aggressive.


-----

The bottom line, is, WHO, decides, what is true? or what, is just, propaganda, or greenwashing these days?
and, with Governments, and Academia, seemingly, bought and paid for, one really, does Wonder, what is true,
and, What, is just, bought, and paid for, information. I ask you to Decide.
