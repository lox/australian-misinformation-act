I am writing to you today to reference the new legislation to misinformation and disinformation . I have read
through the current draft and it is very very VAGUE. I am extremely concerned for a quite a few reasons this goes against my
constitutional rights to free speech. It is also alarming that that this has been put in place to silence anyone’s rights to go against
this current government . Even so far as you will be giving ALL RIGHTS TO a few and strangling the No vote ! This too is
DIRECTLY against our current non altered constitution. This places Australia in a place of being in the worst of human rights
ever seen before ? So only the government, indigenous and yes voters have the right to debate again this is in the Magna Carta.
This as you know is not IMPARTIAL nor fair. So we’re bing silenced prior to any constitutional change being put in place
before any amended changes. This is highly ALARMING where one Government Deliberately gives ONE SIDE THE YES
SIDE all benefits Effectively silencing in the name of misinformation .The information on line should be pulled from facts ! But this
is deemed vaguely anything against the governments objective . Is this factual or THEYRE version of facts like Covid .  This
puts Australia into line with with CHINA and Russia . This is a class action suite just waiting dressed up as loosely and vague as
possible silence FREE SPEECH AGAINST ANYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOESNT LIKE OR CANNOT GET
OVER THE LINE WITHOUT DECEIT. I only pray they’re is a special place in hell for the perpetrators of this communist
law. I will register with human rights my plight .
