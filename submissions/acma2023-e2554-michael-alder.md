We've been dealing with misinformation and disinformation for our entire lives. Latterly, much of it from the
government. The idea that we need the government to protect us from it is preposterous.

Working out who is reliable and who is not is not always straight forward, but the optimum solution is more openness
and candour, not something politicians or bureaucrats are known for.

Drop the whole thing. It is either extremely stupid from conception or decidedly sinister.

I am thoroughly sick of being treated like a                - hild.
