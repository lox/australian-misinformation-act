On one hand, the Labor government says stopping misinformation is about ‘keeping Australians safe online’.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister says ‘misinformation’ is people who don’t agree with his divisive
proposal to embed a new bureaucracy into our government. The terms ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’
have taken on a new meaning: anything that opposes the elite’s agenda, not necessary untruths!

For left-wing governments and commentators, ‘misinformation’ has become the new ‘hate speech’ – terms
used by the left to justify legal punishment against any opposing views.Social media companies have been
happily censoring and banning those who criticise left-wing ideologies for years. It’s an ominous sign that
the Albanese government demands still more censorship and wants to give itself powers to enforce it.

It effectively wipes out opposition such that we won’t even have the semblance of a democracy any more.

Voltaire: “I may disagree with you, but I defend to the death your right to say it.”

Our diggers died in multiple wars fighting for our right to be free and free of censorship. And we are giving
this all away? They would turn in their graves.

The inevitable result of the Labor government threatening massive fines against social media if they don’t
censor content further is that those companies will block content and debates they know left-wing
governments don’t like. Albanese’s government has cunningly drafted its legislation to ensure that when your
posts are censored or your account is banned as a result of his laws, there will be no right of appeal to the
government, and they’ll be able to blame the social media platforms.

The internet and social media have excellent tools for information and learning, however can present false,
misleading information or part truths taken completely out of context to be used against a critic. A good
government, if they educate their people well, should trust their people to process and critique what they read
and see online accordingly. The best remedy to ‘misinformation’ is free and open debate, supported by a fair
independent media which doesn’t simply regurgitate the agendas of the powers that be. There is a strong hold
on the main stream media platforms. Follow the money – we need to pay attention to which
company/organisation is paying for that information to be disseminated in the main stream media. Or is the
main stream media just the government’s mouthpiece to reinforce their agenda or narrative? (And then we
need to ask who is in control of the government.)

While proponents of the legislation argue it is necessary to punish blackmailers and online attackers, critics
say it will expand state control over social media, limit free access to information, and penalise antigovernment speech and thereby could be used against political opponents.

Instead of a liberal and democratic approach, the Albanese government is choosing the path of censorship
and suppression. Government that appoints itself and fellow elites as the arbiters of truth is the worst
possible response – one that authoritarian regimes have chosen since the beginning of recorded history.

We have been hearing terms like communism, fascism, totalitarianism and ‘ministry of truth’ to describe our
government. I wonder why?

It is in war time that strict censorship is imposed in Western Cultures. I have for years said, and I noticed that
many others are now saying, we are in the midst of WW3.
