# Submission relating to the proposed amendments to Communications Legislation.

In response to the measures in this bill on Freedom of Expression and access to relevant information
which has over the past 3 ½ years been withheld from people across the world, and in particular
Australia where Governments and agencies have taken away people’s choice to make decisions
regarding health, resulting in serious harm to the public due to negligence by all Governments.
The abuse of human rights has resulted in economic chaos, and many of our most skilled and
needed workers denied the right to work unless they submit to an experimental gene therapy.
Misinformation and Disinformation coming from the Government, Media and the TGA has been
abhorrent.

  - This Bill is significant overreach by Government and the right to Freedom of speech under
international laws of human rights and Covenant on Civil and political rights.

  - The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech
without transparency or accountability, we have the right to free speech, if not then we are
no longer a democracy but a Communist state.

  - That Government, TGA and mainstream media are to be our exclusive source of information
is extremely disturbing, considering there is no longer any doubt that they have lied
consistently in the past. Information regarding the source of the so called virus, and the
deaths and serious adverse reactions associated with this injection have been exposed by
the best Doctors, Scientists and Independent Journalists in the world.

  - The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of
censorship powers.

  - The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of digital
platforms to provide information and evidence about “misinformation and disinformation”
of private individuals that is a horrifying breach of privacy.

  - The lack of provision for freedom of expression will allow for misuse of censorship powers
according to the international standard requirement for the interference with fundamental
rights of freedom of expression

  - The severity of penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes is excessive and
will have a spine –chilling effect on free speech. When information is coming from reliable
medical or scientific sources, we have the right to decide what actions we will take, instead
of unelected bureaucrats who have no medical training at all.

**Conclusion**

I believe it is imperative that this appalling Bill, which is an attack on our freedom of speech and
way of life, and the freedoms fought for by our ANZACS who would be horrified to see what this
country has become, must be thrown where it belongs, in the shedding machine.
