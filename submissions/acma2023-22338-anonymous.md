"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essenfial command". - George
Orwell, 1984

Never were there more appropriate words to describe the outcome of these proposed laws.

You would have us be subject to an unelected and unknown body of nameless people, supposedly independent, to
create a code of pracfice or worse, create and enforce an ‘industry standard’ to decide what truth is, and what should be
allowed to be expressed and disseminated.  That this is even being considered is horrendous to say the least.

Who decides what truth is? Who decides what misinformafion is? What analyfical process do you have for this? AI?
Someone else's algorithm?  Personal bias? What government decides is truth? The agenda of elites, media, in cahoots
with who else?  And pray tell, who regulates the regulators?

This MUST NOT STAND. We, the people, have the right to use our own brains, our own processes of deducfion and to
make our own decisions about what our opinions are. Laws like this should never have been up for discussion. There is
no good way of doing this, no trustworthy secular organisafion to decide what to suppress or cancel and what to allow.
Manipulafion and deceit will be the only fruits of this law. There is certainly no way of balancing these laws with the
exercise of free speech as you so cavalierly claim like a parent whispering a soothing promise to console a child. Nor can
any organisafion get to the boftom of what 'true' informafion is or is not in every sphere of knowledge. We have already
seen too much suppression and manipulafion of informafion that rather than protect the public, has carefully skewed its
understanding in the way the media (too often influenced by government) wants it. Trust the media? Right ..... Trust
those who are supposedly regulafing the media? Sure.....

Australia is a pluralisfic society. Apparently (though clearly not for long if this Bill is passed) we are a free country, where
a variety of beliefs and opinions exist and where tolerance is touted as our biggest draw card.  But the proposed laws
are nothing less than a power grab for an elite power to enforce its own agenda upon us and to silence anyone who
dares to offer an inconvenient fact or quesfion whatever narrafive is chosen by said elite.  Democracy is where the
people decide. We are not underlings to be manipulated by a regulator deciding what we can or cannot say, or what
informafion we must be 'protected from'.  We are not free to decide unless we are fully informed, not parfially
informed, not informed with the facts you carefully choose for us to consume. Fully informed. And we are certainly not
underlings who must be monitored and whose words or online acfivity must be kept as a record for what can only be
understood as extremely and dangerously vague crimes such as ‘misinformafion’. Who do you think you are?

If you want to counter misinformafion you do this by allowing open dialogue with freedom of informafion and a robust
discussion, not by creafing a 'ministry of truth'. This is totalitarianism. And if by some miracle suspending the usual laws
of human nature it doesn't start off that way, this will certainly be the outcome. Read your history (if you can that is....
much of it has already been suppressed under the banner of 'misinformafion').

Anyone with eyes to see can see where this is going – and this is not hyperbole:

“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book was rewriften, every picture has been repainted, every statue
and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is confinuing day by day and minute
by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.” - George
Orwell 1984

We have been warned. And now so have you. Know your place and don’t overstep the mark.

Live not by lies.
