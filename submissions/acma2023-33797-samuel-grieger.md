To whom it may concern.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the process regarding the proposed
mis/disinformation bill.

I strongly oppose the government interfering with our communication in any way and see it as a
dangerous and fundamental erosion of freedom of speech.

Firstly, in complex and novel situations we do not know where the truth may lie and we need all
avenues of knowledge open to us. Since the “ACMA misinformation report Fact sheet 1: key
research findings” focuses on Covid, I will use the medical arena as an example. Covid was a
completely novel situation. Therefore, we had a limited understanding. As a community, there was
no accepted protocol for how to treat the disease and its community impact. Therefore, we need
exposure to all information so we can chart our course through the unmapped terrain. This includes
ideas and opinions that might be wrong, for, in the midst of our limited understanding, we do not
know where the truth is and therefore, by definition, must be open to all ideas. We must let these
ideas battle freely and trust the truth will out. Eliminating all competing voices leaves us at the mercy
of only a few select voices that are subject to their own incentive structures that may or may not
align with ours. For example, I imagine we want third party opinions verifying the claims of the
companies that manufacture the drugs used to treat Covid? In the same way that we want third
party companies verifying the safety claims made by car manufacturers or any other medicine.
Human nature is such that we all lean towards our own incentive. For example, the smoking industry
resisted claims that smoking tobacco was carcinogenic for years. Not because the industry is full of
evil people, but because these individuals were inclined to protect their own interests. The company
responsible for thalidomide, Grunenthal, continued to market their drug after it had been proven to
be harmful. If there were a repression of divergent and uncomfortable voices in this situation how
many more children and mothers would have suffered profound grief? It was the open expression of
ideas and debate that allowed us to secure the health and wellbeing of citizens in both these cases. I
am not saying Covid vaccines shares similarities with tobacco or thalidomide. I am saying, that when
a new product comes out, we do not know fully its long and short term consequences. This is true of
covid vaccines, and will be true for any future pandemic responses. To protect ourselves against the
limitations of our own understandings, we must allow all ideas air time. My understanding is that,
had the proposed powers been in existence, much conversation around alternative treatments and
vaccine risks would have been removed. This is anti-scientific. In complex situations, there are
experts on both sides. Science relies on diverse actors challenging competing narratives until an
understanding emerges that can withstand the criticism of all. Tampering with this process cuts
science off at the knees, and risks a skewed understanding of an issue where real humans may be
forced to pay the price for ideological convenience.

The second reason I am against increasing powers is more general and relates to our democratic
institutions. Very simply, I believe governments should not interfere with speech, except in extreme
situations (e.g. slander). The reason for this is because it eliminates a crucial check in government
power. If the government can reduce the scrutiny it might face, it removes the front-line defence
citizens have against government corruption. To compare Australia to Stalin’s Russia or Un’s North
Korea is, obviously, extreme in many ways. However, it is worth noting that one of the reasons
individuals in these nations were and are subjected to horror and tyranny was because of their
inability to express themselves freely and criticise the government and controversial. What the
government must realise is that they are instituting powers for today, and for decades to come. We
do not know what Australian government may look like in 50 years time. And although it is extremely
unlikely it will descend to tyranny, if it were to do so, this would be the first step. It seems far too

easy for governments to use the proposed legislation in an unethical manner and, even if the current
administration might not, what about the next, or the governments thereafter? Allowing
governments to dictate narratives to our media companies is an obvious and worrying canary in the
coal mine for the health of our free speech. As a citizen and teacher of history, I implore you not to
interfere with the free expression of Australians.

While it is true that erroneous information presents a challenge to nations and individuals, this is
nothing new. Communities have always had to contend with competing ideas. Often, it is our
openness to new ideas that generate new knowledge and understandings. It was our openness to
the uncomfortable truth of thalidomide that allowed us to cease its use; it was the British
Government’s inability to quash new ideas that led to democracy, and, as an academic, it is my
openness to new ideas that leads me and my students to new knowledge. We do not know where
the next new piece of useful but controversial knowledge might come from. At all times, but
especially in times of crisis (war, pandemic etc.) we need a free flow of information. This includes the
freedom of individuals to be wrong. Because if we allow individuals to only espouse the accepted
narrative, we will never find the answer to novel dilemmas and we tie our hands to potential
solutions to challenging problems.

Finally, as soon as we talk of ‘balancing’ free speech, we are limiting free speech. By doing so, we
attack the best and most peaceful tool at our disposal to ensure a peaceful, just and open society for
our children. Please, do not increase the powers of government to influence the information and
conversation in the modern public square.
