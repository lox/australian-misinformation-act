As my submission to the inquiry into the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding this draft legislation.

Whilst some may believe that the solution to “misinformation” or “disinformation” is more centralised control, I believe that it is far
better to let people share their beliefs, respectfully disagree, debate on issues, and make up their own minds about matters.
History has shown us that censorship is a dangerous path to tread, and should be avoided. This is all the more the case in a
society that purports to be pluralistic.

This draft bill, however, will effectively shut down the sharing of many ideas and create so much legal uncertainty for online
platforms that they will be forced to censor anything which might be considered controversial.

This would be disastrous.

It is not right for a mere handful people to make decisions about what should or should not be classed as misinformation or
disinformation – and why this draft bill must either be dumped or at least heavily revised to remedy the major flaws it is built
upon.

Yours sincerely,
