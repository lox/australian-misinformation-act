Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an
Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill undermines the fundamental principles of freedom
of speech and disproportionately harms regular individuals who depend on the Internet as a
democratic platform for expressing their opinions and sharing knowledge.

The provisions outlined in the bill create arbitrary distinctions between different classes of citizens,
granting those in positions of power, such as politicians, journalists, and members of educational
institutions, the authority to disseminate information, whether accurate or not, while imposing
stricter limitations on the general public. This creates an unjust system where regular citizens, who
often possess profound knowledge and industry insights, are curtailed in the exercise of their
democratic rights.

The Internet, in my view, is the most remarkable and powerful democratic invention in the history
of humanity. It has allowed ordinary individuals, who were previously voiceless, to participate in
meaningful discussions and make their voices heard. This bill poses a significant threat to the
empowerment of regular Australians by placing excessive fines on digital services, which would
result in unprecedented constraints on freedom of speech on these platforms.

Furthermore, the all-encompassing nature of the proposed legislation, without any mechanisms for
pressure relief valves, exacerbates the harm it could inflict on the freedom of speech. This bill
assumes the ability to accurately distinguish between true and untrue information, which is an
impossible task in a constantly evolving world where new information frequently contradicts what
was once widely accepted as fact. The examples provided in this submission highlight the
unpredictability and inherent flaw in assuming the ability to differentiate between fact and
misinformation.

Notably, the bill not only targets provably false information but also deems true information as
"misleading" or "deceptive." The value of freedom of speech lies in its allowance for open and
honest discussions, enabling the exploration and debate of truth. Limiting speech to what is deemed
"correct" or even what is not provably false stifles the diversity of viewpoints and hinders the
crucial process of sense-making necessary for informed decision-making.

Even reputable experts, such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of
Australia, have expressed serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. In a tweet on
June 25th, 2023, he cautioned about the implementation of such legislation, stating that it would be
impossible to enforce without penalizing non-misinformation and potentially stifling crucial
discussions.

By assuming that the Government, its accredited media, and educational institutions are the sole
arbiters of truth in collaboration with digital platforms, this bill disregards the experiences and
viewpoints of ordinary Australians. It undermines the diversity of opinions necessary for a robust


-----

democratic process and hinders the acquisition of vital information required to make informed
voting decisions. Categorizing certain political party viewpoints as misinformation and removing
them from digital platforms will leave voters in the dark and go against the very principles on which
our democratic system is built.

In conclusion, I vehemently oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is essential to protect and uphold the principle of
freedom of speech as it enables a vibrant democratic discourse, fosters the pursuit of truth, and
ensures an informed citizenry. I urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional
Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider the implications of this bill and prioritize
the rights and voices of regular Australians.

Thank you for considering my submission.

Yours sincerely,

Christopher Hansen
