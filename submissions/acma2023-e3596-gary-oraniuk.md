To Whom It May Concern:

I write in regard to the (short title) proposed Draft Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 in order to detail
my objections the proposed Bill.

I regard this proposed Bill as an absolute outrage, in that this Bill lacks comprehensive detail as to any definitions
as to what the proposed ACMA body might regard as misinformation and disinformation, in that any decisions seem
likely to be arbitrary, given that this legislation is quite rushed and lacking the comprehensive and deeply-thought
out detail that good legislation should exhibit.
The terms disinformation and misinformation also demonstrate a predilection to Wokeness, as exhibited by the
original and spurious terms politically correct, hateful and hurtful speech, and so on, all of which terms ultimately are
used in order to suppress free and open thought and speech, the latter being fundamental to a thriving democracy
and
the ability to conduct thoughtful debate on many political social, and other serious issues that daily present.

No suppression of serious political debate should be entertained, especially by government, and these pejorative
terms
disinformation and misinformation should enter the domain of political debate, as these terms seem mostly to relate to
the internet, especially.
However, the internet has always been a domain has always had its trolls and so on, and been a domain not unlike
any
information source-the mainstream media, etc.-where judicious attention must be applied to all and any information
gleaned from any source whatsoever.

What, it seems, irks governments, especially, is the immediacy of communication and the breadth of often
controversial
information affecting said governments.

And whether governments like the adverse exposure some researchers have furnished, governments must accept
that
this information must be allowed to be presented, if only in the usual interests of openness, transparency,
accountability.
This is our democratic and unalienable right.

The panel will see, below, the Law and legislation related to interference in anyone's political rights and duties.
To interfere with these rights is regarded in these Acts as a criminal offence, as stated, and it seems to me, at least,
that
the Bill in question may infringe on the rights protected under the Acts and statutes detailed below, especially,
perhaps, if
the determinations by the ACMA Board are overly arbitrary.

I have personal experience of political suppression and censorship by Facebook, a number of my posts being denied


-----

tens of millions of dollars invested in the Facebook that is regularly censoring people politically.
Such behaviour by Facebook is an obvious infringement on the Law and legislation quoted above, and should never
have
been allowed to happen.

I am happy to give further details on this Facebook matter, should they be sought by the relevant authorities and
committees,
etc.

Given the facts I have related as regards my experience with Facebook, it seems that any legislation is likely to
interfere with
people's right to free political thought and expression-as this is what this Bill seems to be all about-the Bill should not
proceed
at all.
This Bill is the Thought Police legislated, and has no place in any alleged Democracy.

Given that I have come to the awareness of this Bill, and the writing of this submission very late, I regard what I have
stated here
as a sufficient expression of my opposition to this Bill.

I am happy for this submission to be made public.

Best regards, and in the best of faith,
