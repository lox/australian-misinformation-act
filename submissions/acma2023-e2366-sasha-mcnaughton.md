Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to express my deep anger and outrage at the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that this bill blatantly
disregards our freedom of speech and the democratic principles that underpin our society.

The bill creates two distinct classes of citizens    - one comprising politicians, journalists, and members of educational
institutions, who have the power to spread information, whether it is true or false, online. The second group consists
of regular citizens who often possess more knowledge about certain topics than those in the first category. This
imbalance of power threatens to undermine the voice of everyday Australians, who have historically relied on the
internet as a platform for democratic discourse.

Moreover, the excessive fines outlined in the bill will result in digital services being more restrictive in their speech
policies, further limiting the freedom of expression. The code applies across the entire industry with no provisions
for flexibility or exceptions. This rigidity and lack of accountability exacerbate the potential harm caused by the bill.

Attempting to discern truth from falsehood is an impossible task, as new information constantly emerges,
sometimes contradicting what was once widely accepted. Mistakes and changing circumstances are part of the
human experience, and it is not the government's role to define and police what is true or false.

The proposed legislation fails to distinguish between provably false information and truth that may be deemed
misleading or deceptive. Freedom of speech is vital as it allows open and honest discussions to take place, even
when individuals may be wrong. It is through these discussions that truth can be debated and consensus can be
reached.

The involvement of industry bodies, often influenced by major players in their respective fields, raises concerns
about potential anti-competitive practices. Large digital services could use industry codes as gatekeeping
mechanisms, impeding new competitors and stifling innovation. The free-market competition between platforms to
address misinformation has demonstrated its effectiveness, with users naturally gravitating towards platforms that
align with their expectations.

Furthermore, the bill's extraterritorial reach is unworkable and disregards the jurisdiction of other countries. It
places an unfair burden on foreign digital services, expecting their compliance with Australian law, industry codes,
and regulations. This overreach sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to retaliatory actions by other countries,
harming Australia's standing in the global internet community.

The bill's infringement on the implied constitutional freedom of political communication is deeply concerning. It
curtails legitimate discussion on matters of public interest, which are often highly contested among political parties
and interest groups. Any limitation on this freedom undermines the core principles of our democracy.

Labeling certain viewpoints as misinformation and removing them from digital platforms jeopardizes the information
accessibility necessary for informed voting decisions. Independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers will
be subjected to complex reporting standards and misinformation reports, potentially ruining their reputations and
hindering their ability to contribute to public discourse.

The threat of interference and the potential to incentivize Government-approved journalists and media institutions
raises questions of bias and fair representation. This type of control is reminiscent of undemocratic regimes and
undermines Australia's commitment to freedom of expression.

As a founding member of the United Nations and a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),
Australia should uphold the principles enshrined in these documents. Any attempt to categorize fundamental faith
worldviews as misinformation is intolerant and incompatible with the values of our diverse society.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 is deeply flawed and threatens our fundamental rights and democratic principles. I urge the Department of
Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to reconsider this bill and ensure
that freedom of speech is protected and respected for all Australian citizens.

Yours faithfully,

Sasha McNaughton
