This proposed legislation ‘New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation’
would strip away the very ‘democratic’ freedoms it purports to protect. Giving a handful of
bureaucrats at ACMA the unmitigated power to dictate what can be discussed, debated, and
said, or what this small government cabal wants to impose on Australians as its version of
‘The Truth’, by labeling any opinion other than its own as ‘Misinformation and
Disinformation’. This proposed bill would take away a person’s right to freely dissent or
disagree with any government narrative without fear of punishment or reprisal. The notion
that up to a $500’000 fine could be leveled at any public social media or other public
communications platform that carries an Australian Mum or Dad’s opinion smacks of
Communist style totalitarianism. The breathtaking hypocrisy of this government, that this
legislation should apply only to ‘The great Australian unwashed’ and not to those in
government is one of the most undemocratic things that I have witnessed in my lifetime. I
whole heartedly oppose this legislation that muzzles Australian free speech, and say “Yeah,
Naw, mate”, put this proposed legislation in the rubbish bin where it belongs.

Sincerely, John Nelson
