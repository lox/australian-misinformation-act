# Submission - 
 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
 Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

20 August 2023

**Introduction** Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on this Bill.

I strongly oppose this Bill. I ask that it be rejected in full.

**End of free speech** This Bill would end free speech in Australia. It can also apply overseas.

In effect, it creates a ‘Ministry of Truth’, a la the George Orwell book 1984,
which has been categorised as fiction.

One person’s fact is another person’s fiction. This has always been the case.

What is fact to the ALP, government of the day or ACMA is very often
different to what is fact to other parties, experts and individuals.

There is no ‘single source of truth’. All Australians must be able to consume
and share information which may differ from that which the government and
government authorities wish people to consider to be fact.


**‘Fact checking’ is**
**censorship**

**Government and**
**broadcasters**
**exempted**


The recent phenomenon of so-called ‘fact checkers’ is a clear attempt to
censor people and restrict their ability to access and share information which
differs from that which the government, and the people who control it, wish
people to believe.

The ‘fact-checkers’ are employed by companies that have no accountability.

The Bill exempts government and broadcasting services from promulgating
‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’.

This is the hallmark of communist and other totalitarian regimes. The Bill will
create censorship befitting North Korea, not Australia.

This is not appropriate in a country that is purportedly a democracy.


**Conclusion** I ask that you reject the Bill in full and any similar bill which attempts to end
free speech in Australia, implement country-wide censorship and create a
dystopian future.
