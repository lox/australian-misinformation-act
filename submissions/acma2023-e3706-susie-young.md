To whom it may concern

Thank you for giving the opportunity to give feedback to the proposed law.

I believe that censorship under the terms of disinformation and misinformation is open to a very broad interpretation, and
makes this bill potentially more dangerous than any perceived problem it seeks to address.
Whilst understanding some of the problems that exist with social media, I feel that everyone has the right to their individual
opinion. I am an older Australian who remembers when there was no TV, and I personally do not subscribe to Facebook
Twitter etc
however I realise there are good and bad influences with all media. This does not mean that the general public needs to be
spoon fed, and I believe that critical thinking should be promoted in a positive and respectful way.

Who then is the arbiter of truth? Who decides in their wisdom what is the truth? What checks and balances are there too
ensure that the supposed truth is actually the truth? An individual’s truth is relative to their personal experience and does not
make them a dishonest person in telling their story, just as science is related to personal findings in studies. These studies
very often give different results which is not bad, and can indeed open the debate to further review. This I believe is healthy
for our society.
Things in the past have been thought to be true and later proved not to be, this is life, how can we have a healthy debate with
such a law that controls the media by the government?

Whilst I agree that there are certain unsavoury items that have need to be monitored and removed, i.e. content encouraging
such things as child sexual abuse and extremist violence, I feel like this bill is very vague in what is actually going to be
censored, and may lead to a potential loss of free speech and sharing of ideas critical to our democracy. Indeed, free speech
is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

The universal declaration of Human Rights 1948, article 19 states:-

“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, and regardless of frontiers.

This agreement was created at the time for a purpose, and I believe we should abide by this agreement to protect our human
rights as an Australian family.

Thank you in advance for considering my submission on this matter.

I remain, yours faithfully

Susie Young
