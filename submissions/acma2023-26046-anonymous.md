# One could rightfully claim that in a free and functioning democracy, one has the right to be offended. It is only when you are free to hear what you don't agree with that - and would prefer not to hear - that all voices are free to express their thoughts and opinions, as well as the unblemished truth and facts. When are you not free to be offended, you are freely being oppressed.

 This suppression of free thought and personal could be viewed as violating Sex Discrimination Act 1984 if it stops a person either identifying as the sex of their birth and/or the chromosomes of their birth or citing that a person has two chromosomes. 

 A Misinformation and Disinformation Act could be considered to be a breach of Australia's obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Subjecting people to the silencing of their thoughts is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and would by this act be intentionally breaching both Articles 1 and 2. With article 1, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, ... mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as .., punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing . This act is governmental coercion in the extreme. Which leads to the contravention of Article point 3; this is an order from a superior officer or a public authority which is being invoked as a justification of (mental anguish and) torture. If personal thought is security of person, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. violates security of person. 

 This is set on individual bureaucrats determining what they consider "misinformation". Having the power to determine the truth concentrated in few hands often leads to corruption. What social media considered misinformation throughout 2020 to 2022 has been largely proven to be factual, as proven by the Freedom Of Information request by Australian Senator Alex Antic.

# Throughout history, those that oppress others' speech have never been on the side of justice or righteousness. They have always - and without exception - ended up killing millions of their own citizens, from the Huguenots onwards. It is also interesting to note, that at all times when people have been silenced, not only was their content correct, it encouraged distribution of their content.
