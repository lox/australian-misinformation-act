## PUBLIC SUBMISSION

We are extremely pleased to provide this public submission in response to the
Australian Government’s release of its exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
_Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and draft_
regulatory framework for public consultation.

We note that community feedback and all submissions on this public discussion paper
are sought to be received by Sunday 6th August 2023.

In January 2023, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian
Government would introduce new laws to provide the independent regulator, the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat
online misinformation and disinformation.

The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital platforms
to do more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation
and disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech.

The proposed powers would:

  - Enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or

require them to keep certain records about matters regarding misinformation
and disinformation.

  - Enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering

measures to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms,
which the ACMA could register and enforce.

  - Allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of

regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting
misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.

The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed from
digital platform services.

The ACMA powers will strengthen and support the existing voluntary framework
established by the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation
(the voluntary code) and will extend to non-signatories of the voluntary code.

**Policy concerns in relation to government overreach**

The Shadow Communications Minister David Coleman MP said it was a “complex area of
policy and encouraged the government to avoid overreach”.

The public will want to know a lot more information about exactly which ‘experts’ will
decide whether or not a particular piece of content is ‘misinformation’ or
‘disinformation’.

The significant penalties associated with this legislation potentially places substantial
power in the hands of government and departmental officials which raises a number of
legitimate policy concerns.

**Protecting freedom of speech**

Freedom of speech is an essential aspect of the rule of law and ensures there is proper
accountability and transparency in government decision making.

**Ben Blackburn Racing strongly believes that all Australians must be free to**
**express their opinion about the content of laws and regulations regardless of**
**political affiliation along with the decisions of governments, Ministers,**
**departments and agencies – otherwise proper accountability and transparency**
**and proper oversight of policy and regulatory decisions is greatly impacted and**
**reduced.**

The Australian Human Rights Commission also emphasises that freedom of expression
and opinion are the foundation stone for a free and democratic society and a necessary
condition for the promotion and protection of human rights.

The UN General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR) on 16th December 1966 which also covers freedom of expression and
opinion.

ICCPR Article 19 states:

**1.** **Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.**
**2.** **Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall**

**include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all**
**kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the**
**form of art, or through any other media of his choice.**

In 2000, freedom of expression was enshrined as a fundamental right in Article 11 of
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union:

**Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom**
**to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without**
**interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.**

**The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.**

For Australian democracy to function, citizens need to be able to speak freely and
openly online about how they would like to be governed and be free to criticise any
policy decision made by those who are in power including governments and Ministers.

This constant exchange of ideas and opinions isn’t just an optional extra when it is
politically expedient for politicians to do so, rather it is an ongoing and fundamental
pillar of freedom of speech in a democratic system of government which Australia has in
place.

It is indeed a complex policy area as several multifaceted issues overlap – freedom of
speech – freedom of expression – cybersecurity – national security – privacy concerns –
electoral integrity – media and advertising standards – government accountability and
transparency – and media literacy.

Any effective regulatory framework and response by the Australian Government needs
to carefully balance the fundamental pillars of freedom of speech and freedom of
expression against keeping Australians safe online.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to make a contribution through this public
submission on the Australian Government’s exposure draft of the Communications
_Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and the_
draft regulatory framework as outlined in the Guidance Note dated June 2023.
