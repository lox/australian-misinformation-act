I do not support the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. This is a terrible idea. Australian’s do not need ‘panel’ of people deciding
for them what is mis/disinformation on social media platforms. We all have the right to think
critically about what dis/misinformation is ourselves. It is offensive that the government believes it
must shield us from this. We are not children. As an Australian, I am embarrassed that we are even
considering this. We are not a communist country, we are free to think for ourselves and indulge in
any information we choose to. Shame on you.
