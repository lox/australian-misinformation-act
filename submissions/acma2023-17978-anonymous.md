# Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 (BILL)

 Response to Bill -6 July 2023

**Withdraw this Bill so we the Australian people can retain our democratic rights.**

# Freedom of Speech and Thought

“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”
― **United Nations, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19.**

1. The first step of any tyrannical and totalitarianism Government is to restrict the

freedom of speech and expression of thought so as not to interfere with the
propaganda and aims of that Government. The Government’s goal is to quash
and eradicate any opposing views to the ruling prevailing political class and
culture.

_The Bill moves Australia towards the goal of restricting opposing views._

2. As per Appendix A, only Unarguable Facts can be subject to misinformation or

disinformation. Prevailing Facts are subject to change as information or theories
develop. Opinions and Beliefs can be argued any which way.

_This Bill gives the Government powers to determine what are acceptable prevailing_
_facts, opinions and beliefs, which is thought control of the people and must be rejected._

3. There is no omniscient being or universal source of truth or pure information.

Therefore, any person or persons deciding if a matter is misinformation or
disinformation will be using their individual and prevailing cultural, political,
scientific, or religious bias, knowledge, and preferences to determine if speech is
misinformation or disinformation or if it has caused harm. This does not make
the determination correct. It just makes it their determination. Others will have
a different determination. As such the Bill can never be reinforced without the
axiom that the Government is right, and the people are wrong.

_This Bill moves Australia towards the goal of restricting opposing views._

_The Bill moves Australia towards a tyrannical and totalitarianism Government that seeks_
_to quash and eradicate any opposing views and must be withdrawn in its entirety if our_
_democracy is to survive._

# Matters in the Bill

4. Harm Definitions:

_The broad reaching definitions of harm in the Bill provides the Government with_
_extensive overreach powers with which to control the freedom of speech and_
_thought of the people, whilst not being held equally accountable for truthfulness in_
_Section 6 of the Bill._

(A) Harm in this Bill appears to mean both physical and mental harm:

a. The accusation of Physical harm would need to establish a clear cause
and effect between speech and a physical act. A butterfly flapping its
wings in the Amazon cannot be held accountable for a cyclone in
Japan. It is the person that commits the physical act that must be held
accountable, NOT the person that talks about it. If the person that
talks about it is held accountable then we are accepting that the
person committing the physical act has no free will or personal
judgement, which is clearly wrong.

_Physical harm cannot be related to speech on social media._

b. Mental harm is subjective and subject to the resilience and sensitivity

of individuals. As we can witness daily on social media, weak
individuals are offended about everything. The Bill therefore enables
the mentally incompetent and weak to complain and object about
every matter that conflicts with their beliefs or reality, regardless if
that reality is true or not. This will paralyse freedom of thought and
expression and stifle opposing views and progress.

_Mental harm is subjective and exposes every citizen to accusation from the_
_mentally incompetent and weak._

c. The drafting in the Bill reads “harm means harm” and “harm

means hatred”. Since harm and hatred cannot be adequately
defined the tautology appears to have been adopted.


-----

(B) Harm definition (a): Harm and Hatred. Harm and hatred are two different

concepts. A person can carry Hatred but cause no Harm. This definition
makes it an offence for a person to carry hatred, and using a similar logic,
love.

Discrimination against any subgroup of society is adequately covered
under the Racial Discrimination Act. This Bill however may cause a
conflict with that Act since a person could be accused under this Bill of
harming another group whilst raising a racial discrimination matter.

_Example 1: Many people hate the Australian Labor Party, but no harm is_
_caused. Emotions cannot be regulated by the Government._

_Example 2: There are many theories on the migration of Aboriginals in_
_Australia. The timelines and places of origin are continuing to be explored. This_
_scientific endeavour, challenge and enquiry will be shut down if it is deemed a_
_disadvantage to a race and “harm” is caused to their feelings. This is the death_
_knell of good exploratory science as we know it._

_This definition seeks to control emotions (hate, love) and to punish people for_
_holding personal preferences and biases. It could also be used stop scientific_
_endeavour if it has the potential to reveal truth that is unwelcomed. This_
_definition is intended to prevent speech and thought against a prevailing trend_
_or line of propaganda and will suppress scientific discovery._

(C) Harm definition (b): Harm to the disruption of public order and society.

This section has the potential to restrict objection to the Government and
the call for change by mass disruption. If the Government thinks that
legislating the people against the right to protest and drive change will
control revolution, it might want to look to the French Revolution with
Madam Guillotine and other examples to learn that this cannot be
legislated. A Government protects against revolution by ensuring the
people believe that the Government is acting in their best interests, and it
is not suppressing their freedoms. Two concepts that this Bill appears to
be rejecting.

_This clause is intended to suppress freedom of speech and thought against_
_actions to change Government. This cannot be legislated and will have the_
_effect to informing that people that the Government intends to suppress speech,_
_thought and freedom._


-----

(D)Harm definition (c): Harm to the integrity of democratic processes: Harm

to the integrity of the democratic processes can only be practically
achieved by physically interfering with the voting process or an act that
breaches the constitution. These actions would be a criminal act under
alternative legislation.

A social media platform could influence what is viewed by users but the
Government would have to prove that algorithms are in place to achieve
this outcome. A difficult, if not impossible task.

A Government could take umbrage to a social media platform if it has
many users decrying a policy, action or election strategy and therefore
this definition is possibly only intended to suppress freedom of speech
and thought on a political party’s election prospects.

_This clause is intended to suppress freedom of speech and thought against_
_Government propaganda for elections and other policies. A fundamental right_
_of the people is to reject the Government’s propaganda and policies and_
_determine their own direction._

(E) Harm definition (d): Harm to health. Harm to health can cause damage

but there are many examples of where a practice has been accepted by the
medical “authorities” only to be proven to be detrimental to the health of
the people later. Under this Bill any discussion on a trend would have the
potential to silenced to the detriment of the people.

_Example 1: Thalidomide (10,000 babies affected, 50% mortality). The people_
_might not be able to challenge new drugs and their impacts._

_Example 2: Frontal lobotomy (100,000s that caused untold suffering, mental_
_disablement, or death). The people may not be able to challenge new practices_
_and their impacts._

_Example 3: Helicobacter Pylori discovery changed treatment of stomach ulcers_
_but for years the established medical “authorities” and lesser medical brains_
_pilloried and ridiculed the discovery and Barry Marshall and Robin Warren_
_until they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1982. New discoveries may be_
_suppressed by persons in authority who are driven by ego or personal ambition_
_and not science._

_This clause is intended to suppress freedom of speech and thought against_
_Government prevailing medical opinion, health campaigns or pandemics. This_
_will shut down healthy debate, stop scientific endeavour and stop the exposure_
_of incorrect or flawed advice._

_Has the UN and the World Health Organisation influenced the drafting or_
_provision of this clause?_


-----

(F) Harm definition (e): Harm to the environment. It is difficult to envisage a

practical example here and any deliberate physical damage to the
environment is covered under other legislation. A conclusion that can be
arrived at is this clause is intended to support the Government’s strategy
on renewable energy and silence discussion on the benefits or otherwise
of this strategy.

_This clause is intended to suppress freedom of speech against climate change_
_propaganda or renewable energy sources. This is a direct attack on freedom of_
_scientific challenge and enquiry and the right for people to follow one theory_
_or another._

(G)Harm definition (f): **Economic or financial harm. There are many**

financial rules and controls in Australia that already manage this area.
These controls effectively manage investment advice and charlatans.

What this definition does is make it an offence to express an opinion or a
belief on an economic or financial matter.

_Example: The Government has stated that renewable power is cheaper but our_
_power bills continue to rise. This Bill has the potential of silencing challenges_
_to that line of renewable energy propaganda._

_This clause is designed to suppress freedom of speech and thought against_
_Government financial propaganda, strategies, speeches, plans and reports._

5. **Definitions on Misinformation 7(1) and Disinformation 7(2) Definitions: These**

can only be applied to unarguable facts. The Government may however use this
clause to quash and eradicate opposing views to propaganda or the aims of the
Government. Prevailing facts, opinions and beliefs can only be debated, never
irrefutably proved.

_Example: Religion is a belief and cannot be proved or disproved. Should the_
_Government decide that any religion needs to be cancelled or silenced then these_
_clauses in conjunction with the harm definitions could be invoked._

_The Government is not omniscient and persecutions under this Bill to prevailing facts,_
_opinions or beliefs must be made public with a statement by the Government clearly_
_proving the Misinformation and Disinformation and harm and the person accused_
_must be provided with the transparent and public right to respond. Anything apart_
_from Unarguable Facts will not be able to be irrefutably proved by any person therefore_
_making this Bill the “power of the word of the Government”._


-----

6. **Section 6 Exclusions: The Government has excluded Government Institutions**

and Corporations in Section 6 of the Bill.

There are however two concepts that should not be overlooked when considering
Section 6.

(A)Firstly, an Institution or Corporate Body (or Government) does not physically

exist and the people within that Institution or Corporate Body (or
Government) make speech or release information.

(B)Secondly, a key principle of our Constitution is that all persons are equal and

therefore every person regardless of their affiliation to any Institution or
Corporate Body (or Government) should be held to the same standard as all
other persons.

(C) QED: There cannot be a carve out for any Institution or Corporation (or

Government) as the persons in those Institutions or Corporations (or
Government) must be held to the same standard as all other persons as we are
all equal under the Constitution.

_There can be no carve outs to misinformation or disinformation or harm if we are_
_all equal. The intent of this section is to relieve the Government and its employees_
_and associates of its obligation to be truthful._

# The Government works for the people.
 We do not relieve the Government of its obligation to be truthful.
