Our view is that there is more than enough legislation and regulation, at the Federal and State levels.
This proposed legislation could do more harm than good, especially in silencing views that are valid, but not necessarily
'mainstream, that could be labelled 'misinformation or disinformation and carry penalties. We witnessed a toxic form of
censorship imposed by social media during Covid in particular, at the behest of the government in US, as it turns out, most of
it biased and very subjective.

The view is that this legislation is aimed at silencing views not supported by the government, ie The Voice.
Do we want to create new 'heresies', similar to Galileo's day, where the powers that be nearly killed him, until he retracted
his scientific but non mainstream/power that be, view, that the earth rotated around the sun.

We are not convinced this legislation will add to community wellbeing or serve to protect their rights, rather than diminish
them, there seems to be adequate legislative protection for.
Creating more legislation, more regulations, more offices and departments will only add to the financial burden on all of us,
especially here in, already groaning at the huge debts incurred by the state government, without asking for public
feedback or consent.

Sincerely

Phyllis Menos
