**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023**

**Government Response and Implementation Roadmap for the Digital Platforms Inquiry**

Any response to the proposed legislation dealing with ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’
comes up against the problems of definition, free speech, and the wisdom of allowing a
government agency to police information spaces; these spaces should by necessity be robust and
contested forms of public debate. It also brings into question the very structure of power in
society; who are defined as sources to be trusted, and who are to be the guardians of the
discourse of digital platforms.

From the outset, the draft Bill decides in advance the only scope of so-called ‘misinformation’ it
intends to combat by its exclusionary definitions:

**excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the following:**

(a) content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire;

(b) professional news content;

(c) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited by any of the following:

(i) the Commonwealth;

(ii) a State;

(iii) a Territory;

(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as an accreditor of
educational institutions;

(d) content produced by or for an educational institution accredited:

(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor of
educational institutions; and

(ii) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable Australian educational institution;

(e) content that is authorised by:

(i) the Commonwealth; or

(ii) a State; or

(iii) a Territory; or

(iv) a local government.

Given that journalists and politicians are among the least trusted professions in Australia, trailing
at 21% and 12% respectively in the 2022 IPSOS Global Trustworthiness Index

from being held to account according to any standard of ‘misinformation’. Indeed, in the ACMA
2021 report “A report to the government on the adequacy of digital platforms’ disinformation
and news quality measures” they make the assertion that, firstly, there is “no established
consensus” on disinformation or misinformation yet seek powers to determine the punishments
for social media companies who cause ‘harms’ by allowing such content on their platforms.
Undeterred by being unable to come up with an adequate definition of misinformation, the draft
Bill persists in building upon ACMA’s desire for a draconian infrastructure of penalties for
social media companies.

The ‘harms’ in the Bill are defined as:

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender,
sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability;

(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;

(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State,
Territory or local government institutions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians;

(e) harm to the Australian environment;

(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the
Australian economy.

When they are not already dealt with under current Australian law, such as the Racial
_Discrimination Act 1975 or laws on defamation, they are vague to the point of being legally_
indefinable. Indeed, ACMA itself claims that an ‘empirical assessment’ of the nebulous terms of
misinformation and disinformation by a study of Australians who believe they have experienced
it on social media is sufficient to know that it is a problem. The argument with this is that there is
no further analysis of what harms this misinformation actually does, or its sources. It could be
argued that the only way some of these ‘harms’ are mitigated is through their exposure to the
light. For example, through people sharing their experiences of opioid dependency on social
media, the community as a whole becomes aware of the dangers of overprescribing of pain
medication. The medical establishment who previously ignored this ‘harm to the health of
Australians’ and the government department who supported them, are forced to acknowledge
this harm. Under the proposed Bill, social media companies would be under threat of sanction
were it to allow the undermining of an establishment ignoring a problem in favour of what later
comes out to be ‘misinformation’. The official narrative changes. What was once misinformation
becomes ‘information’.

Similarly with more contentious issues such as ‘war and peace’ does the spectre of censorship
loom over this proposed Bill. It has become an article of faith in the Australian political and
journalistic sphere to define the military conflict in Ukraine as an unjustified invasion by Russia

against a sovereign nation. The Maidan Coup of 2014 and the war against ethnic Russians in the
Donbass perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalist government have all been forgotten by a media
which once reported on the complexities of the conflict. In much the same way, Australian media
subsequently admitted that the so-called Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction were a deceit
perpetrated by Western governments as a rationalization for the invasion of that sovereign
country, despite peddling the misinformation contemporaneously. If there were another
deception that were to put Australians at war, it is highly possible that the clause proscribing the
harms of ‘disruption of public order or society in Australia’ would be invoked to deter social
media companies from allowing on their platform citizens exposing any such fabrications. This
is the danger of allowing public debate being defined as to its perimeters by the government
through ACMA and a compliant media. Through its proposed penalties on social media
companies, ACMA becomes a de facto censor leading to a less-informed public.

ACMA’s determination that there must be an assessment related to the “range of chronic harms,
such as reductions in community cohesion and a lessening of trust in public institutions” then it
is clear that the issue to be addressed is not misinformation, but information which does not
emanate from, or conform with the official narrative. In the world of ‘fact checkers’ and
‘misinformation experts’, all of whom, like First Draft’s discredited Bellingcat (who are either
openly or covertly financed by governments and corporations), the information space is
becoming a stultifying morass. It becomes a circular logic, illustrated in this Bill by ‘factcheckers’ who are financed by Western states and corporations defining the ‘truth’ in
conjunction with governments and corporations. This truth then becomes sanctified by officially
sanctioned purveyors of ‘professional news content’; the circle is completed, and disinformation
becomes, by definition, any contrary account of the world.

This Bill is an ill-conceived attempt to stifle public debate on the most important issues of the
day. By defining ‘misinformation’ as inconvenient challenges to official narratives, the
government has shown that it has given up on convincing people of its case and has decided to
use ACMA to impose censorious demands on social media companies. The proposed legislation
is illogical, authoritarian, and a danger to public debate in Australia. As such, it should be
discarded in its entirety.
