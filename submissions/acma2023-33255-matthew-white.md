## RE: Exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment
 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I am a married man with a wife and two young children at Primary School representing
myself and my family, and have worked for 30 years in the electronic engineering and
communications industry.

I am making this submission in light of the increasing intolerance to differences of opinions
or beliefs I have observed in recent years in our Australian community. More and more I am
hearing one side calling for the other sides words, thoughts or beliefs to be band and not
allowed, instead of stating their counter argument or reasoning, and let those whom choose
to hear it make up their own mind.

The idea that a government body, or any organisation for that matter, can independently
determine what is misinformation or disinformation is in line with Communist or other
totalitarian style governments. To put a government institutions ability to determine what is
truth above the abilities of its citizens is not only an insult and elitest, but dangerous and very
un-Australian.

I fear this may be the beginning for a future government to effectively eliminate any
opposition. Governing parties are constantly claiming oppositions, minor parties and
independents are wrong, which could be deemed misinformation or disinformation.

Other points I would like to make:

  - The Bill is a significant overreach by the government.

  - The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication
under international human and political rights.

  - The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence
speech without transparency or accountability.

  - The Bill includes a vague definition of “harm”.

  - The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable for
excessive policing of legitimate speech.

  - The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is
hypocritical, one rule for government and another rule for Australians in what they
can say.

  - The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of digital
platforms to provide information and evidence that is a breach of privacy.

  - The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for
misuse of censorship powers.

  - The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to
freedom of expression do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for the
interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.


-----

  - The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and
standards is excessive and will cause owners and private users of digital platforms to
err on the side of limiting free speech.

  - Can ACMA be sued if what they determine to be misinformation or disinformation is
later determined not to be?

Thank you for consideration.

Regards,

Matthew White
