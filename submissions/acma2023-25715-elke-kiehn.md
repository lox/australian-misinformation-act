**Misinformation & Disinformation Bill 2023**

This proposed Bill looks like something déjà vu for me. And that is truly scary and
frightening.
Having made my home in Australia some 42 years ago and coming from the other
side of the world, the sheer thought of re-living my early childhood, fills me with
dread.

Born during WWII I can remember the times after the war ended and what happened
to part of my country and my fellow countrymen and women. My family was lucky, we
managed to reach West Germany and settle there – however so many of my family
were trapped in the “German Democratic Republic” (after Germany was divided)
where EVERYTHING was controlled, forbidden, criminalised and then lived under
communism with NO free speech. Only the narrative the Government put out
mattered and everyone having a different opinion was enemy of the state.

This scenario being proposed by this bill is totally unacceptable in a freedom loving
country like Australia with an amazing mix of nationalities having made their home
here.

It is understandable that in this day and age due to technology, there are many
pitfalls by having access to different information platforms, but who is to say the
Government can force information onto the public they seem to see as the only
truth?

We have lived through some horrendous times lately, were told what to do and what
to believe only to find out 3 years later how most of what we were told was indeed
incorrect and outright lies. And that information came from the Government – “for our
health and safety.”

No Government should have any say over what is mis- or disinformation. This should
be left to the individual to research and decide. We are all born with a brain and can
think for ourselves.

It is a sad state of affairs that due to Australia’s isolation, many people have never
been exposed to true dictatorial tyranny and the slippery way into it, what it means
and how it would impact on their lives. Who is truly interested in history and how
things developed over time? By feeding the public just one side of a story is never
acceptable. That is not living in a democraty!

I will do my utmost to try and open peoples eyes what this bill proposes to do to our
freedom of speech and hope that many – including the younger generation who
seem so removed from the past at least start thinking and evaluate the options
before them.
