# SUBMISSION AGAINST the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 by Derek Smith,
 The 47[th] Parliament is the playground for Misinformation and Disinformation by MP’s and Senators who have no Constitutional right to sit in the Parliament of the People. 
 QUESTION: In the 47[th] Parliament how many of the 151 MP’s and 76 Senators are in contempt of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act, the Crown and the People and have no right to sit in the Commonwealth Parliament?

 BACKGROUND

 Australia’s Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act gives each and every Australian the right to VOTE to protect their Freedom and Democracy i.e. Government of the People, by the People, for the People.

In 1901 the Australian Constitution established the Australian Parliament, also known as
the federal Parliament or the Commonwealth Parliament.


The Australian Parliament has four main roles:



- Making and changing federal laws.



- Representing the people of Australia.



- Providing a place where government is formed.



- Keeping a check on the work of the government


# There are 227 seats in the Federal Parliament – 151 for MP’s and 76 for Senators.
 This 47[th] Parliament was elected on 21[st] May 2022 and first sat on 26[th] July 2022.
 The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 PART IV – BOTH HOUSES OF THE PARLIAMENT. Clause 42. Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives shall before taking his seat make and subscribe before the Governor-General, or some person authorised by him, an

 The Oath or Affirmation was taken by Senators and MP’s after they had been sitting in the Senate and House of Representatives.
 The Governor-General and Justices of the High Court aided and abetted the Senators and MP’s in this contempt for the Constitution Clause 42 as above.
 Since Senators, MP’s, the Governor-General and Justices of the High Court cannot comply with such a basic as Clause 42 why should the People expect anything right from the 47[th] Parliament? This is kindergarten stuff.

 The Governor-General allowed the PM and his Cabinet to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Australia, her land and her people. There is no provision in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 for the PM and his Cabinet to make such an oath or affirmation.

# In Australia, the Crown as the Head of State is representing the Commonwealth of Australia, her land and her people. i.e. Government of the People, by the People, for the People. The oath or affirmation by the PM and his Cabinet is divisive and designed to undermine the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900.
 Non-compliance with the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 is not an option.
 The oath or affirmation taken by the PM and his Cabinet is an invention with the purpose and intent of promoting a Republic in Australia. This can only be decided by a Vote of Australians, not the PM and his Cabinet and not the Governor-General.
 The Senator’s, MP’s, Governor-General, Justices of the High Court who do not respect, uphold and protect the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act have no Constitutional right to remain in office.
 AUSTRALIANS’ RIGHT TO VOTE
 Section 41. No adult person who has or acquires a right to vote at the elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.
 The PM and His Cabinet are not at liberty to engage in Misinformation and Disinformation and deceptive conduct to fool the People of Australia. 
 The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act and Referendums approved by the People, do not provide for a National Cabinet of the PM, Premiers, and Chief Ministers of the States and Territories. The purpose and intent of the Constitution is that the Parliaments of the States and Territories shall continue to make such laws under their own Constitution. All laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under its Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, judges, and the people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State;

# The National Cabinet is like having the tail wag the dog, with the effect that the States and the People of the States determine the laws of the Commonwealth.
 The State Parliaments make laws in the States’ interest. The Commonwealth Parliament makes laws in the National interest which may overrule State laws.
 Australians do not need ACMA, any other Government entity, or a National Cabinet to think for them.
 Australians are a freedom loving people who expect those in office to serve the People by respecting, upholding and protecting the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 which created our Nation Australia and gave us our identity as Australians.

 • Australia is not Hitler’s Nazi Germany
 • Australia is not Communist.
 • Australia’s Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 9 July 1900 Act gives
 each and every Australian the right to VOTE as they see fit and not as directed by the ACMA, the National Cabinet or any State or Commonwealth Government.

 • Australia is an all-inclusive People who love Freedom. NO Choice, NO
 Freedom, NO Democracy. 

 • Australians are FREE to choose what to believe and what to reject, they do
 not need ACMA, a National Cabinet or any Government to decide for them.

 • The Parliaments are the creators of fiction. The People need protection from
 the Parliaments i.e. Government of the People, by the People, for the People.
