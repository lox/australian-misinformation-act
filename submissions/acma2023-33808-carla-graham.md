# Truth will sort itself out with a free flow of information and freedom of speech. Social media is the modern town square where all things may be discussed freely. 

 Truth is not something that is to be decided by bureaucrats or politicians to align with an agenda that has been handed to the government by some self appointed overlord such as the WEF or the UN or pharmaceutical interests or a mining company. These people do not have the welfare of this country or its people to heart. It is all about money and control, no matter the cost. 

 Nothing good has ever come from control of information. It's only purpose is to deceive and to push people into believing, then acting upon an untruth. 

 Examples of government propaganda costing Australian lives include 50 years of hiding the dangers of asbestos as Australian workers were sacrificed to mining profits, and the recent covid 19 plandemic and it's lethal vaccine which funneled over a trillion dollars to big pharma, while doctors were threatened with deregistration if they dared to cure covid or informed patients of the risks of the vaccine.  Families were ripped apart and businesses destroyed. Many died. 

 Just as we saw countries around the world prepare for, then act in lockstep through this fiasco, we are now seeing this censorship legislation passed in countries around the world within days of each other. Concurrently, it has been announced just a couple of days ago that pandemic X is in the pipeline and will be even worse than covid 19 with even heavier handed “containment measures” required and the military used to combat rioting in the streets. Clearly, the government cannot be trusted to do right by the people.

 Save the censorship for kiddy porn where it may do some good, and leave the subjects of politics, science, medicine, and religion out of it.  Government has no business interfering in peoples conversations or sharing of information or ideas.  The only reason they would do so is to brainwash people into co operating with something evil to the detriment of its citizens.

 Deep 6 the Ministry of Truth.
