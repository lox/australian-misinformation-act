To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Robyn Broderick an Australian citizen I would like to voice my concerns regarding the
draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill.

I feel that this will take away the average Australian citizen choice to voice an opposing opinion to
that of the governments. It is our human right to live in a democratic society, where we can have
freedom of choice, freedom of speech without the threat of a fine or imprisonment. It is an
individuals own choice what they believe and they should be able to make an inform choice once
knowing both sides of the story (information).

Everyday Australian use social platforms to voice concerns. This has been highlight especially in the
last 3 years where media coverage has not always shown a different side. With many experts having
to go on social media platforms to voice their differing opinion to what is the mainstream narrative.

Currently many social platforms already suspend users when they believe the content may be
incorrect, abusive so why change the bill. To give them more power?

What guarantees would the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) give that they
would not overreach their powers?

Many mainstream media streams such as professional news including electoral content have been
misleading or false but the standards would not apply to them. If this amendment is for the everyday
user on a social media platform it should also apply to them. This rings alarm bells to me.

Kind Regards,
Robyn Broderick
