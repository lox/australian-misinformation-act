Submission on the exposure draft of the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I am making this submission in my role as a journalist and writer on Substack
SUMMARY
This proposed legislation sets up the Australian Media and Communications
Authority (ACMA)
as a powerful censorship organ of the state. The effect will be that ACMA
controls everything
that Australians can see, hear and say online through industry codes of practice
enforced by
Big Tech corporations.
This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine
what is “untrue,
misleading or deceitful” (misinformation) when they have no such ability. ACMA
doesn’t know
(and cannot know) what is true. It therefore cannot preside over, set and
enforce
misinformation codes of practice.
This is outsourced state censorship, totalitarian in scope, designed to control
the public
conversation and camouflaged as protection.
Misinformation is jargon for being wrong, and disinformation is a made-up word
for lying.
The government should not be in the business of determining “truth” for the
Australian public.
This legislation should therefore be rejected in full.
Section 1: what is ACMA, what do they do, and why are they pushing for this
Section 2: Dodgy research creates a fictional “misinformation threat” to justify
censorship
Section 3: This law is meant to destroy the refuge of dissidents such as
Substack, Rumble
Section 4: Terrifying excerpts of the actual proposed legislation
Section 5: In conclusion

1) What is ACMA?

Australia’s media regulator ACMA is a federal government bureaucracy of 514
employees1
formed in 2005 to regulate broadcasting, radiocommunications, telecommunications
and
online content.
It does useful things such as planning the radiofrequency spectrum, collecting
licensing fees
and fining SMS spammers.2 It regulates broadcasters3 ensuring a percentage of
Australianmade
content is aired on TV and radio, and investigates complaints including about
decency.
The problems begin when its remit requires it to regulate media content, both
broadcast and
online.
ACMA is required to interfere in news and current affairs content, including


-----

polemics and talk
shows, using industry codes of practice.
This puts ACMA in a difficult position, turning it into a censorship organ and
forcing it to
become an arbiter of truth in areas where such determinations may not even be
possible.
1.1) ACMA tried to censor the internet including Wikileaks
An early warning on using ACMA as a censorship bureau came when the Federal
Government
tried to “filter” the internet by forcing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to
block websites it
didn’t like.
They sold it as necessary for our safety, to block dangerous crime and child
porn.
But during the trial period in 2009, ACMA’s government blacklist of banned
websites was
leaked and published by WikiLeaks.4 Several Wikileaks sites were on the banned
list. Surprise!
Embarrassed, the Federal Government tried to hide the list and denied Wikileaks
was on it
(they were). Then they referred the leak to the Australian Federal Police (AFP)
for criminal
investigation.

By November 2012, the government backed down. Instead of ACMA censoring the

internet
with a blacklist, ISPs instead used existing legislation to block Interpol’s
list of child abuse
websites.5
Turns out, that’s all that was needed.
The lesson was learnt about the danger of government censorship. Until now.
1.2) ACMA again now censors at ISP level
In 2015 a new statutory government office called the eSafety Commissioner was
created to
stop bullying and abuse online, including incitement to violence and child abuse
material.
All the staff except for eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant are employed by
ACMA.6
In 2021 the Online Safety Act was passed beefing up the powers of the office.7
The new laws gave the eSafety Commissioner the power to demand ISPs and social


-----

media
services reveal the true identities of anonymous users when investigating
complaints about
cyber-bullying or illegal activity.
The Commissioner also got the power to compel ISPs to block websites at server
level. Just like
in 2009.
The Commissioner can send a “link deletion notice” or an “app deletion notice”
and they must
take it down. 8
The legislation created mandatory industry codes to compel ISPs, social media
platforms,
search engines, messaging services and app stores to censor illegal and
restricted content.
Just like in 2009 it is couched in terms we would all agree on such as banning
images of
abhorrent acts (eg: rape) or blocking the streaming of violence such as the
Christchurch
massacre.
Just like in 2009 this is marketing to sell you censorship, because illegal acts
are covered by
existing legislation.
And here’s the problem: this time nobody is going to leak the censorship lists
to Wikileaks.
Julian Assange is now locked in a UK prison.

https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/whats-on/online-safety-act

The eSafety Commissioner’s office can liaise across government departments and

“safety
stakeholders” both in Australia and internationally to co-ordinate censorship
activities.9
One of these “stakeholders” is the World Economic Forum (WEF), a lobby group of
the world’s
largest corporations and billionaire oligarchs.10 The WEF pushes for political
power through
“stakeholder capitalism”.
“Stakeholder capitalism” is a new ideology that wants to supplant old systems
like
communism or capitalism with a “fourth industrial revolution”. Stakeholder
capitalism is all
about sidelining democracy in favour of technocratic control, disguised as


-----

philanthropy.11
It’s about selection, not election. They appoint people, you don’t get to vote
for them. It
replaces free speech with selected voices - and they choose those voices. It is
anti-democratic.
It doesn’t want you to control your country. Stakeholder capitalism loves the
permanent
bureaucracies of government because it can work with them, influence them and
capture
them.
It is important to understand the ideology that has infiltrated into the push
for this law.
It’s not about protecting Australia from harm, it’s about controlling the public
conversation so
you are not free.
The WEF appointed Commissioner Grant as one of their “#Agile50, the world’s most
influential
leaders revolutionising government”, her profile says,12 and briefed her on the
launch of their
digital safety principles in January.13
In 2022 at the WEF’s annual Davos shindig, Ms Inman Grant said it would be
necessary to
recalibrate human rights online “from freedom of speech to the freedom to be
free from
online violence”.14
Notice the conflation of speech (words) with violence (a physical act).

Digital Safety to
produce a report categorising “online harms” in August.15
It listed some real harms such as doxxing and sextortion.
But then comes “misinformation”, a made-up term to complicate being wrong, and
“disinformation” which means lying.
This jargon, “misinformation and disinformation”, is used to create a problem
that seems
technical and difficult to understand so that you might need an “expert”.
Permanent Canberra bureaucracies and the WEF are feeding a new, fake industry of
“misinformation experts” that is propagated by PR firms such as Weber
Shandwick16, which
represents Pfizer and Moderna.17
The “experts” then produce research to justify the censorship that the
bureaucracy wants, so
that it can act.
They traffic in analysis based on these fake terms so the state can seize powers
and crush
those who dissent from the agenda.
This is what ACMA did when it commissioned such research to lobby for this
legislation (more
on this below).
In reality there is no qualification that enables someone to identify
misinformation in a way
that you are not able to by simply checking provenance and evidence.
ACMA, the WEF and the eSafety Commissioner are trying to create a problem in
order to
justify censoring the internet.
The joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report reclassifies misinformation (being
wrong) and
disinformation (lying) as harms that the government needs to deal with – as if
the worst lies
hadn’t repeatedly come from government itself. Australia’s TGA still pretends
the covid genevaccines
prevent you catching and spreading covid after almost every triple-jabbed adult
in
the land caught the virus.18
The purpose of the joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report is to provide
“foundational
terminology” for “multistakeholder discussions”, the report says. That means

groups get to discuss government censorship with policymakers using the

categories in the
report.
“These discussions in turn can facilitate the creation of policies and
interventions that
effectively address online harms,” it goes on to say.
That is the purpose of terms like “misinformation” and “disinformation” being
categorised as
“harms”. It justifies the state controlling your speech with “interventions”.
Leading journalist Glenn Greenwald has observed that nothing has been more
destructive or
dangerous in history than the power of the state to suppress and criminalise
opinions it
dislikes. The entire history of human knowledge is nothing more than the
realisation that
yesterday’s truths are today’s shameful errors.
19
1.4) Example of ACMA acting as a Ministry of Truth
ACMA has already been using industry codes of practice to interfere in current
affairs
broadcasting. It is problematic and time-consuming. Sometimes it’s simply not
possible to
know what the “truth” is in cases of disputed science.
So this legislation outsources the bother of comment and post deletions to the
Big Tech
platforms. Google, Meta et al will censor your speech according to ACMA’s rules
set out in the
industry code, but without bothering ACMA with the nitty gritty. With the advent
of AI this will
be easy: the algorithms can do most of the work.
As an added bonus, ACMA gets to pretend this is some kind of protection of your
freedom,
since the state will not itself be doing the deleting – as if that makes any
difference since they
set the rules.
This is not a joke.
The factsheet for this legislation includes “ACMA will not have the power to
request specific
content or posts be removed from digital platform services” as an example of
“strong
protections for privacy and freedom of speech”.20
In reality there are no protections at all for your privacy or freedom of speech
in this power
grab.
Here follows an example of how ACMA has previously been forced to act as an
arbiter of
“truth” in current affairs programming due to industry codes of practice.

ACMA suppressed a doctor’s warnings about covid gene-vaccines using industry

codes of practice
ACMA investigated a religious program that hosted a medical doctor who
questioned the
covid gene-vaccines in September 2021.21
“We’re seeing an uptick in the laboratory of reactivated other viruses;
Epstein-Barr, herpes
viruses, HPV viruses, we’re seeing an uptick in certain cancers, already,” said
the doctor on
subscription cable TV show Ministry Now.
ACMA investigated this statement and found it to be “not accurate” and a breach
of the
industry code of practice on accuracy.22
ACMA didn’t know whether it was accurate or not. It couldn’t know. It was too
soon in 2021 to
know if the gene-vaccines cause cancer. Studies take time to design, conduct,
get accepted,
peer reviewed and published.
How could anyone see whether the mRNA products cause cancers in a year, or even
six
months, when both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials destroyed their control
group23 after
just 2.5 months? There was nobody to compare it to.
The best we could do was to have doctors sound the alarm over what they were
seeing, which
is exactly what the doctor did on Ministry Now.
The broadcast licensee didn’t provide ACMA with studies to prove the cancer
risk, and ACMA
couldn’t find any. The product had been on the market for less than a year.
Google censored search results in 2021 and 2022 making it difficult to find
published studies
criticising the gene-vaccines. Google discredited the voices of scientists
warning of its terrible
side-effects by elevating parody accounts that mocked them or spurious
“factchecks” to smear

them.24 It even used its cloud drive to block a compilation of gene-vaccine

injury stories from
being emailed.25
ACMA ruled the doctor’s statement false and a breach of the code because it
could find no
relevant evidence.
It made its decision on what it could find: an AP “fact check”26 (now removed)
that
“debunked” a Natural News story about how mRNA gene-vaccines can cause cancer,
claiming
it misrepresented a 2018 study. But this had no bearing on whether the doctor’s
claim was
true or not.
Australian health authorities said the gene-vaccines were safe for cancer
sufferers to use – but
this was irrelevant to the accuracy of the doctor’s claim as there were no
placebo-controlled
studies done on cancer sufferers to prove this.
Now you see the deadly danger of censorship.
ACMA ruled against the narrow-caster of the pay TV program even though it cannot
know that
what the doctor said was “not accurate”.
It has now been shown that the gene-vaccines can indeed activate cancers.
They have also been shown to reactivate latent viruses including herpes.
A peer-reviewed paper by Seneff et al from June 202227 reviews the medical
literature. It
explains how the gene-vaccines downregulate critical pathways related to cancer
surveillance
and infection control in the body leading to an increased risk of certain
cancers and the
reactivation of viruses, including herpes.

Numerous case reports of rapid cancer progression following the gene-vaccines

have now
been published including here29, here30 and here31. That last one also warns of
the
immunomodulatory effects of the gene-vaccine which caused an Epstein-barr virus
resurgence.
ACMA cannot know the truth. Accurate science is not done by consensus. Therefore
the only
safe answer when medical opinions differ is to let doctors be doctors, and air
their thoughts
without censorship, deplatforming, persecution or demonisation.
ACMA cannot know what is true and therefore cannot set censorship rules. Big
Tech
platforms cannot arbitrate “truth” any more than ACMA can. An open and free
marketplace
of ideas is necessary to determine objective reality as well as being necessary
for our
freedom.

censorship
The landing page for this proposed legislation states the powers created are
consistent with
the recommendations in ACMA's June 2021 report to government on the adequacy of
digital
platforms' disinformation and news quality measures.32
To bolster this report, ACMA commissioned research from the University of
Canberra’s News
and Media Research Centre and from social media consultancy We Are Social.33
The University of Canberra research conducted a survey and interviewed focus
groups about

‘Misinformation’
was defined as the inadvertent sharing of false information, while

defined as the deliberate creation and sharing of information known to be

false,” the report
states. 34
In other words, “misinformation” is simply being wrong online, while
“disinformation” is lying.
The real problem then begins: how do you know what is true and what is wrong?
How do you
know if someone is deliberately lying? Can you read their mind? Perhaps you are
wrong.
The entire premise of this research is intrinsically subjective.
This is a problem of epistemology. It can’t be solved by research such as this.
So the researchers were left with individuals describing things they thought
were
misinformation. Again, highly subjective.
In the survey methodology for determining whether a person was “Covid-19
informed vs
misinformed”, the researchers state:
“The questions addressing misinformation beliefs are designed to assess
agreement with
official advice on a range of issues related to Covid-19 including mask wearing
and
appropriate treatment … Those who are in general disagreement with the
authoritative or
factual advice are labelled as ‘misinformed’. Of the five statements, if a
respondent is in


-----

disagreement with one or two health advice, they are categorised as ‘misinformed
(low)
(30%)’. If a respondent disagrees with three to five statements, they are
recoded as
‘misinformed (high) (11%)’. The rest was recoded as ‘informed’ (60%)” 35
(emphasis mine)
So there it is.
The assumption is there, underpinning the research, that what the Government
says is “true”
and if you disagree with that then you are “misinformed”.
ACMA recognised this in its June 2021 report to government, which made the key
recommendation that it wanted censorship powers.
On page 9, ACMA wrote:
“Similarly, those who rely on social media as their main source of news also
reported higher
levels of exposure to COVID-19 misinformation than the general population ….
This research
relies on respondents both knowing and accurately self-reporting on their level
of exposure to
misinformation. To help address this limitation, the N&MRC also asked surveyed
Australians to
respond to 5 claims about COVID-19 guidelines, prevention strategies and
treatments (for
example, ‘wearing a mask does not significantly reduce your risk of infection or
spreading the
virus’). Those who agreed with official advice at the time for all 5 statements
were

considered ‘informed’ (59%), while those who disagreed with 1 to 2 statements

were
considered ‘misinformed (low).”36
The University of Canberra report was bulked up with a quantitative analysis of
where people
get their news. This provided lots of charts and graphs and percentages to
provide the
impression of an objective, measurable, factual and scientific report. This
camouflages the
dodgy and subjective part of the report, and helps ACMA to appear authoritative
and
informed when making its case for censorship power.
These figures basically showed large numbers of people get their news from
social media –
which is exactly why the government wants to control social media.
The second report that ACMA relied on to ask for more powers, is the We Are
Social network
analysis, which ACMA provided to Letters From Australia in response to a media
request.

The assumptions are built right into the headline.
Researchers trawled the internet to find “misinformation” in order to count the
mentions of
key words, quantify it into objective sounding percentages and authoritative
graphs.
They decided on three “key narratives” that were “misinformation” to count:
anti-lockdown +
Q-anon, anti-vaccine and anti-5G.37
Again, these categories are all incredibly subjective.
What is “anti-vaccine”? People whose whole careers were dedicated to making
vaccines, such
as Canadian vaccinologist Byram Bridle, were labelled “anti-vaxxers” in 2021 and
2022
because they raised concerns over a rushed new class of product.
“Anti-lockdown” was lumped in with “Q-anon”, as though people must be unhinged
to oppose
the shut-down of the economy over a relatively mild virus that had a global
infection fatality
rate of less than 0.03 percent for under-60s, before vaccines, in its more
virulent form.38
The assumptions are breathtaking.
This is junk science.
Here is a snip from page 24 to illustrate how “misinformation research” paints
opinionated
and subjective judgements of other people’s ideas as objectively quantifiable
science. Pink
text, arrows, underlines are mine.

Notice how “anti-vax narrative” is here defined as being against the

government’s coerced
injections of gene-vaccines.
Notice how this misrepresents these people as being against all vaccines, which
demonises
their position by exaggeration.
These products were bought by the government before testing was finished.39 They
were
developed in less than a year despite being an entirely new class of drug with a
novel
mechanism of action, even though the safety and manufacturing testing for

traditional
vaccines ordinarily takes 10 to 15 years.
Notice the “guilt by association” fallacy which smears those with fact-based
concerns about
the inadequate testing of the gene-vaccines with people who allegedly said put
your faith in
God instead of a vaccine.
This report confuses opinion with “misinformation”, such as the meme below (pink
text is
mine).

The fact that this entire report is pseudoscience is not the fault of the

researchers.
The entire class of “misinformation and disinformation” research is junk for the
exact same
reason. The premise is wrong.
When given the remit by ACMA to go and quantify “misinformation” on the
internet, the
researchers did their best.
But they cannot help but produce exactly what you see, because it’s not possible
to determine
what is true and what is not. It’s a loaded judgement and always will be.
The government told Australians that an entirely new class of drug, a
gene-vaccine that was
only ever provisionally registered by the TGA and rushed to market with barely
any testing,
was safe and effective. It didn’t work and it’s so unsafe that thousands of
Australians have
injuries and an unknown number have died.40
ACMA now wants to censor “misinformation” and their own research clearly shows
that they
consider disagreeing with whatever the official government advice is at the time
to be
“misinformation”.
Other than that, ACMA cannot actually define “misinformation”, as they admit in
their June
2021 report to government it is “constantly shifting” and there are
“difficulties in assessing
falsehoods”.

This is incredibly dangerous. This is about silencing dissent – including from

our own
democratically elected representatives in Parliament.
ACMA’s June 2021 report to government slandered Craig Kelly, at that time a
sitting Member

of Parliament, as a misinformation superspreader for his brave advocacy for
gene-vaccine
injured people. He lost his preselection and was kicked out of the Liberal
Party.
It stated:
“In our commissioned research, We Are Social compiled a list of the top 20
Australian
influencers sharing misinformation narratives, based on their total number of
interactions. Heading this list was celebrity chef Pete Evans, followed by
Federal MP
Craig Kelly, and prominent anti-vaccine campaigner Taylor Winterstein.” 41
3) This law will destroy the refuge of dissidents
The fact sheets published along with ACMA’s June 2021 report reveal the true
intent of this
legislation.
It’s to destroy the last places online where dissidents could be heard.
During the pandemic, dissident doctors and scientists were censored,
deplatformed and
persecuted by the state across the Anglosphere.
At the direct request of Australia’s Department of Home Affairs42 and Department
of Health43,
both Twitter and Facebook took down posts from gene-vaccine injured people
looking for help
because they got in the way of the “safe and effective” gene-vaccine messaging
campaign
already planned in November 2020.44

standards on misinformation that could cause physical harm” because it

accurately states that
the Pfizer gene-vaccine injured her.45
Twitter (pre-Elon Musk) turned down the visibility on Stanford University
professor of
medicine Jay Bhattacharya in 2020 and 2021 so his messages would never catch on
and trend
– so you wouldn’t read them.46
That’s because he co-authored the 2020 Great Barrington Declaration with Harvard
University
professor of medicine Martin Kulldorff and Oxford University epidemiologist
Sunetra Gupta to
warn the world that the the best covid strategy was not lockdowns at all but to
protect the
elderly (who had a thousand-fold higher death risk) while allowing the young to
develop
herd immunity from natural infection.
Not even the medical professors and elected representatives could share true
information
that challenged the enforced state covid propaganda on Twitter, Google and
Facebook and not just in Australia but in New Zealand, the US, the UK and Canada.
YouTube (owned by Google) would take down the true stories of gene-vaccine
injured
people almost immediately.47
Corporate media houses refused to print the stories that went against government
covid
policy. They ignored the voices of gene-vaccine injured people and when they
mentioned
them, they were demonised as “cookers” and “anti-vaxxers”, or their injuries
were
represented without evidence as being “extremely rare”.
So dissidents found refuge in smaller sites.
Substack became a home for real journalism. Rumble and Bitchute were the free
speech
alternatives to YouTube. Scientists and doctors and gene-vaccine injured people
could talk
about what was happening there.
But ACMA does not want these corners of respite to exist at all.
The purpose of this new law is to crush the dissidents on these places, too, so
there is
nowhere for them to share their stories on the internet at all.
This can be seen in Fact Sheet 3 that accompanied ACMA’s June 2021 report to
government requesting new powers.

“Severe muscle wasting, nerve damage: Manly mother-of-two, once a surfer, tells

Under the heading “Scoping new regulatory powers for the ACMA”, the fact sheet

complained that “conspiratorial communities” could seek out alternative
platforms to
avoid moderation (censorship) and that because their codes of practise were
voluntary
platforms could ignore them.
They want the power to force all platforms to censor for them.
They wrote:
“The ACMA recommended The ACMA recommended that government should provide it
with reserve powers to register industry codes, enforce industry code compliance
and make
standards relating to the activities of digital platforms. These powers would
provide a
mechanism for further intervention if code administration arrangements prove
inadequate,
or the voluntary industry code fails. The government has accepted this
recommendation.”48
They even created a “Misinformation and Disinformation Action Group” to expedite
their
censorship drive.
Thanks to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter and the excellent journalism of Matt
Taibbi and
a team of investigative reporters at Racket News, the public learnt that the
mass
censorship of social media over the last three years was at the direct request
of the US
security state, its five-eyes allies (including Australia) and a linked network
of more than 50
agencies, foundations and university-linked think tanks that draw funding to
promote the
censorship-industrial complex.49
This censorship was so shocking to the American people, who have a
constitutionallyprotected
right to free speech, that a court case was launched which resulted in an
extraordinary ruling on July 4 temporarily banning the FBI and Biden
Administration officials
from even contacting social media firms for the purpose of censorship that would
infringe on
the First Amendment free speech rights of Americans.50
Australia has no free speech protections in law at all other than a weak implied
right to
political communication in the constitution.
But if this legislation goes through, the Big Tech platforms may apply these
“misinformation”
censorship codes internationally, across their operations, including in the US
and Canada and
New Zealand - giving the US security state everything it wanted and pressured
them for and

more, bypassing the First Amendment because Big Tech can say “we chose to have

these
industry codes”.
4) Selected sections of terrifying legislation:
4.1) The legislation vaguely defines “harms” from “misinformation” so that
everything is illegal

4.2) Restrict political speech under the legislation as long as it’s “not

excessive,
having regard to any circumstances the ACMA considers relevant”

4.3) Government, academia and “professional news content”

(compliant media) is exempt

4.4) Demonetisation to starve out alternate independent media will be

enshrined in law

4.5) ACMA can set any misinformation standards or vary them, by

“legislative instrument”, a fancy way of saying “making your own rules
without interference from the elected Parliament”
4.6) ACMA can tinker with the rules

4.7) ACMA is the final arbiter of what the “misinformation standards”

will be, so they really will be the Ministry of Truth behind the
censorship
And again here

4.8) The penalties will be civil penalties, ie: fines described in terms of

commonwealth penalty units. A penalty unit right now is $275

5) IN CONCLUSION:

- “Misinformation and disinformation” is a fake problem, small in scope. Wrong
information on the internet is not a big threat to Australians

- A sinister danger is instead posed by state control of information and
government
policies that cannot be challenged by loud and uncontrolled dissent

- Our safety and wellbeing is guaranteed only by a robust marketplace of ideas
where
people are able to be heard, even when they are wrong

- A parasitic industry of fake “misinformation and disinformation” experts has
been
created to justify censorship. There is no qualification that enables “experts”
to identify
wrong information in a way that we are not able to

- This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine


-----

what is
“untrue, misleading or deceitful” (misinformation) when they have no such
ability.
ACMA doesn’t know what is true. It therefore cannot preside over misinformation
codes of practise

- Several examples of “dangerous misinformation” that ACMA used to lobby for
these
powers turned out later to be factually accurate, or just different opinions
that
challenged government messaging

- This legislation is a power grab by an unelected bureaucracy that would get to
decide
what “misinformation” is for all of us and ban it, strangling our democracy

- Under this legislation ACMA would set the censorship rules, called
“misinformation
industry codes” but outsource the implementation to Big Tech corporations. This
allows
the state to hide behind corporate partners in order to pretend that they are
not
censoring. The technical definition of corporate-state combines is “fascism”

- ACMA are the ones with the final say on the “misinformation and disinformation
codes
of practice” under this legislation, which they would have the power to enforce

- Unelected bureaucrats including former police officers and security state
operatives at
ACMA would determine “truth” for the whole country: what can be seen, heard or
written about online. Whatever they don’t like would be censored as
“misinformation”.
- This law compels Big Tech platforms to collect and report extensive data on
purported
“misinformation” back to ACMA. This inflates ACMA’s importance so they can
traffic in
analysis and ask for even more money, power, people and research to “solve” the
fake
problem that they themselves created

- ACMA, an unelected bureau, would have the power to create legislative
instruments,
making its own rules and sidelining our elected legislators

- This legislation will crush dissident voices from alternative media where they
found
refuge during the covid pandemic. This is deliberate.

- This legislation exempts “professional news” which is not defined, but
includes the
compliant corporate media houses that heavily censored content during the
pandemic.
It is not possible for media to be free and adversarial if it has to partner
with and be
recognised by the state in order to publish. This is the manner in which North
Korea
permits KCNA to publish as “professional news”. Freedom is guaranteed by diverse
and
chaotic voices that the government can’t control by registration, industry
standards or
the centralised ownership of a few big players


-----

- This legislation will back-engineer censorship to the (already compliant)
corporate
media outlets such as Daily Mail, Nine Newspapers or News.com.au which need
social
media shares and Google search visibility for audience and revenue sharing.
Journalists
who might otherwise refuse overt state censorship will be manipulated by
incentives to
comply with “industry standards”

- Australia already has laws to deal with criminal behaviour such as incitement
to
violence, fraud and child porn. Criminal acts are a matter for the police using
the
extensive powers they already have. New censorship rules are not needed

- This legislation carries no protection for free speech at all, despite the
Department
dishonestly claiming to do so by not giving ACMA the power to request specific
posts be
removed. ACMA doesn’t want or need to micromanage because the platforms are
forced to do it for them.

- ACMA and the Federal Government should have exactly zero say in censoring the
voices
of Australians even when they are wrong or misinformed
This legislation cannot be allowed to pass in any form.
