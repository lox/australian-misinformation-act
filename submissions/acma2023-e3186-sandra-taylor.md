Good evening,

Today, I write to underscore the fundamental importance of free speech,
opinion, and proper discourse as **essentialnillarsofa** **thriving**
democracy. I am a single mother to an son and very
## m
fearful of his future, civil/humanrights as an Australians living in
this country with this 'Disinformation Bill'.

This Government should not be able to propagandize the Australian
people.

Vitality of free speech is paramount and our human/civil right.

Australians have lived and thrived without censorship since the advent
##### of the internet. Yet here we are in 2023 as a multi-cultural democracy
forced to defend itself against the governments paid to govern for us,
not over us.

History has taught us that when free speech and opinion are suppressed
or silenced, the foundations of democracy crumble, leaving room for
authoritarianism and tyranny to take hold.
Therefore, as responsible citizens of this great democracy, it is our
duty to defenc and uphold these liberties not only for ourselves but for
future generations.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter

Regards

Sandra Taylor
