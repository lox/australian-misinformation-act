I am opposed to this bill which appears to adversely affect peoples Freedom of Speech in Australia. It will give power
to determine “Truth” of information to a small group of people. The history of the world shows that, in many cases,
what is regarded as truth at one time is Not regarded as Truth at a later time.

This new Bill will result in the punishment of people or companies who do not support the opinions of the
government of the day. It is also not fair to media companies to have to guess whether the government will
consider a piece of information as Truthful or guess whether the government would consider it Misinformation or
Disinformation. How unreasonable is that!

Interesting to note that the government itself is Exempt from its own rule, so it can put out untruthful information
and have no penalty for doing so.

I think this Bill is a big move towards a Repressive State, where the citizens are punished if they express a point of
view which differs from the government’s official view.
