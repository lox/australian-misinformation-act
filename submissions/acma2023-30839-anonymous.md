I do not support the proposed new powers for ACMA to monitor or set requirements on digital
platforms.

I do not support the proposed enabling of ACMA to make their own demands of industry.

I do not support the proposed empowerment of ACMA to create or enforce their own industry
standard.

The public needs to remain self-discerning to keep governments and organisations accountable.

Democracy by definition means exposure to a diversity of views and information rather than a monopoly
on same.

One controlled source of information is more dangerous than some incorrect information in the public
sphere.

Incorrect information proves itself in time, hence the proposed powers are both dangerous and
completely unnecessary.

I would like this proposed bill to be scrapped altogether.
