Submission: This will be the end of democracy because telling people what is really happening in Australia will get us
locked up.

The rage over time will invite a civil war against the ruling class and their wealthy bates with their snouts in the public
purse trough.
The US is not the only place that is like Russia where the powerful and their oligarch mates have most of the wealth.
Australia has this big problem also and it is about to get worse.

Queensland in particular is also very corrupt.

A message I received in the mail.:

##### The real problem with housing and more.

#### A free open and competitive market produces the best outcome. A regulated, controlled
##### and exploited market produces a poor outcome.

 Make Australia prosperous and safe again by sacking all politicians, mayors and councillors

### The war on poverty has been won by the wealthy and their big government mates .

##### Wealthy people have assets - houses, factories, businesses, collectables ... And those assets have risen significantly in the last 4 years by inflation. A 30% increase in a $500,000 house is $150,000. If 50% was owed to the bank before inflation it would now be 38% owed to the bank. Inflation reduces rich people’s debt. Inflation sends up the cost of living. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. The Rich won the war on poverty. The poor lost it. The government deliberately runs the country with inflation keeping poor people poor. The government flooding our economy with heaps of cash is helping the rich and hurting the poor. Inflation gives he poor an economic flogging and is cruel to the poor. How can they save for a house when prices keep going up?

**How** **it** **works!**

##### When a system moves away from equilibrium it becomes chaotic on its way back to equilibrium. Note thunder storms, cyclones ... The LNP and Labor governments increased money supply very dramatically. They dropped interest rates allowing more to be borrowed. They created money and handed it out to companies and individuals filling private bank accounts. Extra money supply drove up demand, that resulted in temporary “Full employment”, then prices rose higher. Now large numbers of people are going to be unemployed because the rise in prices means people can’t buy as much thus collapsingdemand. We are facing the Great Depression of the 2020s. Labor is creating money and the RBA is raising interest rates to soak it up again making rich people richer.

 When demand goes up, ie more money to spend, prices go up to balance supply and demand. This is inflationary. There is no way those in power did not know what they were doing. They were making the already rich much richer and increasing the number of poor people. Big business are making super profits putting up prices. Labor is pushing up the price of electricity thus collecting more money.

### Politicians get power for how it benefits them.

###### It is not about what they can do for the people Politician's benefits come when they make

### The housing crises — Just one example of Queensland’s corruption in favour of our oligarchs.

The Beattie Labor government was very creative legislatively and since then:

##### • * All government deals are protected and kept secret under the privacy act as commercial in confidence,
(protecting the corrupt deals)

##### • * The Titles act removed the Queen as the owner of all our lands and installed a government company as the
owner. Our title is no longer an ownership, it is just a legislated right. In law only a legal entity can own
property, ie a person or a company. All our properties now owned mortgaged to overseas banks for borrowing
security; our private property is used to increase the public purse feeding trough.

##### • * The Regional Planning authority took control of all zoning changes over all private lands. Australia has vast
resources of land and building materials so we have to ask what happened to cause house blocks and houses
to go up by 6+times and 3+ times respectively in real terms? (The power to exhort large sums for zoning
decisions)

An example: a 20 acre / 8ha property with an ordinary house zoned rural residential can be purchased for $2million.
When the zoning is changed to low density residential it is worth $18million. This block can have 160 houses on it.
The profit of $16milion adds $100,000 to the price of each block of land. Is that profit shared equally by those making
the change and those getting the benefit?

Developers get some very special secret deals like secret agreements with government to not change the zoning of
near by land until all their subdivisions are sold. Yarrabilba has not had any competitive development near them since
that development began. This is similar in many areas. The only explanation is that after paying such big bribes the
deal is that the developers can still make a profit by restricting competition. Now Queensland has a massive housing
shortage and rising prices.

Those who did not sell to the Developers eg in Bahrs Scrub had their property zoning changed to water way frontage
or nature corridor, or parkland which massively restricted what they could do with their property. These properties are
massively devalued.

In Deception Bay the Morton Bay Council and State Government approved developments and dug 5 big drains to
Blue Pacific Road where they stopped. In one period of two years, three times 360 homes down stream of these
developments were flooded. A house that had never been flooded before had water halfway up their kitchen
windows, a meter above their kitchen bench. Insurance companies are now refusing to insure these houses. We have
the best government money can buy.

The Councils hit developers with infrastructure charges of $38,000 for a house, $25,000 for a subdivision. Then lots of
application fees for every minor detail of the development with big hits like sewage connection fees when the house is
being built. It is these moneys that allow the Councils to have 8 people working on a road repair, rubbish removal or
anything and only one person actually doing any work. Those standing around watching are the managers and their
lackeys and these people get a much higher pay than those actually doing the work.

Our land taxes have risen. Residential by 10% and commercial by 20%. Reason would be because the interest on the
moneys borrowed on our lands have also risen. We are not allowed to know how much has been borrowed because it
is “commercial in confidence”.

Wellcamp: $220million for 1000 beds in flat roofed bungalows that would normally have cost $70 million. This land is
owned by Queensland Oligarchs. My guess is $70 million goes to the party, a bonus $70million goes to the Oligarchs
and the Oligarchs gets to own it all. Like in Russia the Oligarchs and Putin and his mates in power are getting richer
and all of us are getting so much poorer that many have to live on the streets. Try building a factory building. A
$200,000 tin shed will cost $285,000 infrastructure charge plus another $70,000 in other red tape charges. This more
than doubles the rent that has to be paid. It tells manufacturers to go overseas.

**The** **LNP** **opposition** **will** **not** **expose** **this** **corruption** **because** **they** **are** **waiting** **for** **their** **turn** **to** **get** **their** **snouts** **into** **the**
**public** **purse** **trough.**

A new home buyer will be paying off bribes, fees and charges for land around $250,000 and for the house $100,000 +
for the next 30 years. But worse, these new houses drive up the price of existing old houses. This is viciously unfair to
young people.

When we see an advertisement that states “authorised by ... for the .. government” we know we will never get the
truth from that media organisation. We can not trust our government or the media. Politicians try to make themselves
look good when behind the scenes they are benefiting themselves as much as they can, using oligarchs to help them
empty the public purse into their own pockets. This is two faced criminal like. It is this money grab from the public
purse that leads to under funding of hospitals, schools, social security, roads etc. In Queensland Police who commit
domestic violence get supported by their mates. Their victims are get charged with D.V. instead. Police investigate
Police.
