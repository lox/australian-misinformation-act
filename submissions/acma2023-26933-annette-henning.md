To whom it may concern:


I am appalled that the government of Australia is even contemplating measures to curtail free speech. Free
speech is the fundamental building block of a democratic society, without which, citizens will only hear
approved government speech. Government are our representatives not our overlords. It is we the people
who determine how our country is governed, and the government serves at our pleasure.

If politicians and unelected bureaucrats think that they have special insight into ‘The Truth’ we must already
be several rungs up on the totalitarian ladder! Politicians and bureaucrats are mere mortals, just like the
plebs, and must not EVER begin to believe they can, or ought, to be the arbiters of truth or morality.

Are the lessons of totalitarian regimes both past and present to be ignored? Curtailing of speech has been a
precursor to the installation of every dictator in history. Shall we not examine and learn from the mistakes
made by citizens in the past?

I and the rest of Australia will think and reason for ourselves, and it would behoove government to ensure
there is MORE speech, speech of all stripes, and we the people will decide to whom we will listen!

The proposed Bill is inconsistent with the fundamental freedoms of speech and communication enshrined in
international human rights instruments like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the public square
without transparency or accountability.

The Bill includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which risks it being weaponised to shut down
legitimate speech on pressing social issues.

The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable for excessive and onerous
policing of legitimate speech.

The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is hypocritical and inconsistent
and will establish an asymmetry that results in one rule for government and another rule for Australians in
what they can say.

The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of digital platforms to provide
information and evidence about misinformation and disinformation that is a worrying breach of privacy.

The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of censorship
powers.

The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to freedom of expression
are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for the interference with
fundamental rights of freedom of expression.

The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and standards and for failing
to provide evidence requested by ACMA is excessive and will provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.
