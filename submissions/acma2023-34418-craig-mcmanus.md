**The Australian people refuse the Australian Parliament the power to contravene the International Human Rights**

**Article 19.**

**1.** **There is no difference between what our Federal Government is proposing with the Communications**

**Legislation Amendment (combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and what has just been**
**condemned in defence of democracy in the United States. (Attachment 1)**

**2.** **This proposed Bill is in direct conflict with the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” Article 19 which**

**identifies “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold**
**opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and**
**regardless of frontiers”.**

**3.** **Australia is a signatory to this convention and therefore it is a requirement of the government whose role is**

**to represent the people, to ensure the freedom of expression under this convention should not be ignored.**

4. **The Charter of the Commonwealth, signed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Head of the Commonwealth,**

**Commonwealth Day 2013, Section II, “Human Rights”, is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human**
**Rights and other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments.**

5. **The Charter clearly supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for freedom of speech, where**

**political parties DO NOT have an ability to communicate with social-media companies about deleting,**
**removing, suppressing, or reducing posts on social-media platforms that are not protected free speech,**
**protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” Article 19.**

The role of the Parliament of Australia is to meet the needs the of the Australian people. Attempting to remove the
rights and freedom of speech for those that do not agree with the government agenda, policies and views is
fundamentally in contrast with the intention of the convention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” Article 19.

**Our constitutional rights to freedom cannot be signed away by an Act of parliament. The parliament will be held**
**accountable by the people and should this parliament attempt to have the Communications Legislation Amendment**
**(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, enacted, the people will rightly lock the draft Bill in**
**challenge in the High Court of Australia.**


The Issue


Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy,
society, and economy.

**Response: The only threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians will be through the abuse of unconstitutional**
powers applied by political parties abusing the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900,
where political parties are not recognised and therefore hold no constitutional powers to enact Bills.

In January 2023, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian Government would introduce new
laws to provide the independent regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new
powers to combat online misinformation and disinformation.


**Response: There is no independence with this regulator as they are under the direction of the parliament.**


The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital platforms to do more, placing Australia at
the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation and disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech.

**Response: As has been displayed with the continual control of free speech on social media sites over the past three**
years, this proposed bill will legitimise the suppression of free speech.


-----

  - enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or require them to keep certain records
about matters regarding misinformation and disinformation

  - enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to combat misinformation
and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could register and enforce

  - allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation), should a code of
practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.

**Response: The government has set the standard with the rack record of misinformation since 2020 when the Federal**
Government continuously declared that vaccines were safe and effective. Governments insisted these vaccines would
create herd immunity and get us back to normal, such was their effectiveness. This was the entire premise of mandated
vaccines.

The only conclusion that can be reached is that Australian Governments - Territory, State and Federal were forcing
vaccine mandates based on false information and premises.

**Conclusion:** **What this proposed disinformation and misinformation bill teaches us all, in a very telling way is that**
**political censorship spells the end of democracy.**

**This is clearly not in agreement with the feelings of Australian voters and must be overcome at all costs legally,**
**lawfully and peacefully.**

## Charter
# of the
## Commonwealth

Signed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Head of the Commonwealth,
Commonwealth Day 2013


-----

-----

### We the people of
 the Commonwealth:

Recognising that in an era of changing economic circumstances and
uncertainty, new trade and economic patterns, unprecedented threats
to peace and security, and a surge in popular demands for democracy, human
rights and broadened economic opportunities, the potential of and need
for the Commonwealth – as a compelling force for good and as an effective
network for co-operation and for promoting development – has never
been greater,

Recalling that the Commonwealth is a voluntary association of independent
and equal sovereign states, each responsible for its own policies, consulting
and co-operating in the common interests of our peoples and in the
promotion of international understanding and world peace, and influencing
international society to the benefit of all through the pursuit of common
principles and values,

Affirming that the special strength of the Commonwealth lies in the
combination of our diversity and our shared inheritance in language, culture
and the rule of law; and bound together by shared history and tradition;
by respect for all states and peoples; by shared values and principles and
by concern for the vulnerable,

Affirming that the Commonwealth way is to seek consensus through
consultation and the sharing of experience, especially through practical
co-operation, and further affirming that the Commonwealth is uniquely
placed to serve as a model and as a catalyst for new forms of friendship and
co-operation in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations,

Affirming the role of the Commonwealth as a recognised intergovernmental
champion of small states, advocating for their special needs; providing policy
advice on political, economic and social development issues; and delivering
technical assistance,


-----

Welcoming the valuable contribution of the network of the many
intergovernmental, parliamentary, professional and civil society bodies
which support the Commonwealth and which subscribe and adhere
to its values and principles,

Affirming the validity of and our commitment to the values and principles
of the Commonwealth as defined and strengthened over the years including:
the Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, the Harare
Commonwealth Declaration, the Langkawi Declaration on the
Environment, the Millbrook Action Programme, the Latimer House
Principles, the Aberdeen Agenda, the Trinidad and Tobago Affirmation of
Commonwealth Values and Principles, the Munyonyo Statement on Respect
and Understanding, the Lake Victoria Commonwealth Climate Change
Action Plan, the Perth Declaration on Food Security Principles, and the
Commonwealth Declaration on Investing in Young People,

Affirming our core Commonwealth principles of consensus and common
action, mutual respect, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability,
legitimacy, and responsiveness,

Reaffirming the core values and principles of the Commonwealth
as declared by this Charter:


-----

#### I.

### DEMOCRACY

We recognise the inalienable right of individuals to participate in
democratic processes, in particular through free and fair elections in shaping
the society in which they live. Governments, political parties and civil
society are responsible for upholding and promoting democratic culture
and practices and are accountable to the public in this regard. Parliaments
and representative local governments and other forms of local governance
are essential elements in the exercise of democratic governance.

We support the role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group

to address promptly and effectively all instances of serious or persistent
violations of Commonwealth values without any fear or favour.

#### II.

### HUMAN RIGHTS

We are committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
other relevant human rights covenants and international instruments.
We are committed to equality and respect for the protection and promotion
of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right
to development, for all without discrimination on any grounds as the
foundations of peaceful, just and stable societies. We note that these rights
are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and cannot
be implemented selectively.

We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether

rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.

#### III.

### INTERNATIONAL
 PEACE AND SECURITY

We firmly believe that international peace and security, sustainable economic
growth and development and the rule of law are essential to the progress and
prosperity of all. We are committed to an effective multilateral system based
on inclusiveness, equity, justice and international law as the best foundation
for achieving consensus and progress on major global challenges including
piracy and terrorism.

We support international efforts for peace and disarmament at the

United Nations and other multilateral institutions. We will contribute to the
promotion of international consensus on major global political, economic


-----

and social issues. We will be guided by our commitment to the security,
development and prosperity of every member state.

We reiterate our absolute condemnation of all acts of terrorism in

whatever form or wherever they occur or by whomsoever perpetrated,
with the consequent tragic loss of human life and severe damage to political,
economic and social stability. We reaffirm our commitment to work together
as a diverse community of nations, individually, and collectively under the
auspices and authority of the United Nations, to take concerted and resolute
action to eradicate terrorism.

#### IV.

### TOLERANCE, RESPECT
 AND UNDERSTANDING

We emphasise the need to promote tolerance, respect, understanding,
moderation and religious freedom which are essential to the development
of free and democratic societies, and recall that respect for the dignity
of all human beings is critical to promoting peace and prosperity.

We accept that diversity and understanding the richness of our multiple

identities are fundamental to the Commonwealth’s principles and approach.

#### V.

### FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

We are committed to peaceful, open dialogue and the free flow of
information, including through a free and responsible media, and to
enhancing democratic traditions and strengthening democratic processes.

#### VI.

### SEPARATION OF POWERS

We recognise the importance of maintaining the integrity of the roles
of the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. These are the guarantors in
their respective spheres of the rule of law, the promotion and protection
of fundamental human rights and adherence to good governance.


-----

#### VII.

### RULE OF LAW

We believe in the rule of law as an essential protection for the people of the
Commonwealth and as an assurance of limited and accountable government.
In particular we support an independent, impartial, honest and competent
judiciary and recognise that an independent, effective and competent legal
system is integral to upholding the rule of law, engendering public
confidence and dispensing justice.

#### VIII.

### GOOD GOVERNANCE

We reiterate our commitment to promote good governance through the
rule of law, to ensure transparency and accountability and to root out, both
at national and international levels, systemic and systematic corruption.

#### IX.

### SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

We recognise that sustainable development can help to eradicate poverty
by pursuing inclusive growth whilst preserving and conserving natural
ecosystems and promoting social equity.

We stress the importance of sustainable economic and social

transformation to eliminate poverty and meet the basic needs of the vast
majority of the people of the world and reiterate that economic and social
progress enhances the sustainability of democracy.

We are committed to removing wide disparities and unequal living

standards as guided by internationally agreed development goals. We are also
committed to building economic resilience and promoting social equity, and
we reiterate the value in technical assistance, capacity building and practical
cooperation in promoting development.

We are committed to an effective, equitable, rules-based multilateral

trading system, the freest possible flow of multilateral trade on terms fair
and equitable to all, while taking into account the special requirements of
small states and developing countries.

We also recognise the importance of information and communication

technologies as powerful instruments of development; delivering savings,
efficiencies and growth in our economies, as well as promoting education,
learning and the sharing of culture. We are committed to strengthening its
use while enhancing its security, for the purpose of advancing our societies.


-----

#### X.

### PROTECTING
 THE ENVIRONMENT

We recognise the importance of the protection and conservation of our
natural ecosystems and affirm that sustainable management of the natural
environment is the key to sustained human development. We recognise
the importance of multilateral cooperation, sustained commitment and
collective action, in particular by addressing the adaptation and mitigation
challenges of climate change and facilitating the development, diffusion and
deployment of affordable environmentally friendly technologies and
renewable energy, and the prevention of illicit dumping of toxic and
hazardous waste as well as the prevention and mitigation of erosion
and desertification.

#### XI.

### ACCESS TO HEALTH, EDUCATION, FOOD
 AND SHELTER

We recognise the necessity of access to affordable health care, education,
clean drinking water, sanitation and housing for all citizens and emphasise
the importance of promoting health and well-being in combating
communicable and non-communicable diseases.

We recognise the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and

nutritious food, consistent with the progressive realisation of the right
to adequate food in the context of national food security.

#### XII.

### GENDER EQUALITY

We recognise that gender equality and women’s empowerment are
essential components of human development and basic human rights.
The advancement of women’s rights and the education of girls are critical
preconditions for effective and sustainable development.


-----

#### XIII.

### IMPORTANCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMONWEALTH

We recognise the positive and active role and contributions of young
people in promoting development, peace, democracy and in protecting
and promoting other Commonwealth values, such as tolerance and
understanding, including respect for other cultures. The future success of
the Commonwealth rests with the continued commitment and contributions
of young people in promoting and sustaining the Commonwealth and its
values and principles, and we commit to investing in and promoting their
development, particularly through the creation of opportunities for youth
employment and entrepreneurship.

#### XIV.

### RECOGNITION OF THE
 NEEDS OF SMALL STATES

We are committed to assisting small and developing states in the
Commonwealth, including the particular needs of small island developing
states, in tackling their particular economic, energy, climate change and
security challenges, and in building their resilience for the future.

#### XV.

### RECOGNITION OF THE NEEDS
 OF VULNERABLE STATES

We are committed to collaborating to find ways to provide immediate
help to the poorest and most vulnerable including least developed countries,
and to develop responses to protect the people most at risk.

#### XVI.

### THE ROLE
 OF CIVIL SOCIETY

We recognise the important role that civil society plays in our communities
and countries as partners in promoting and supporting Commonwealth
values and principles, including the freedom of association and peaceful
assembly, and in achieving development goals.


-----

We are committed to ensuring that the Commonwealth is an effective association, responsive
to members’ needs, and capable of addressing the significant global challenges of the future.

We aspire to a Commonwealth that is a strong and respected voice in the world, speaking

out on major issues; that strengthens and enlarges its networks; that has a global relevance and
profile; and that is devoted to improving the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth.

#### Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Preamble

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable

rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice

and peace in the world,

Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous

acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world

in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom

from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common

people,

Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last

resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be

protected by the rule of law,

Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between

nations,

Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
