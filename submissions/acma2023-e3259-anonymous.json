      "Free Speech",
      "Human Rights",

      "The bill is unnecessary. In one of the examples given, there is the situation of incitement to hate crimes. But incitement to commit a hate crime is already subject to criminal law.",
      "The proposed bill will harm free speech. Therefore, it is in breach of human rights.",
      "If the bill passes into law, it will make censorship of legitimate free speech, and therefore breaches of human rights far worse, ingrained, and government-endorsed."
