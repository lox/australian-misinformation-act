The “Misinformation Bill” must be rejected.

This is the most frightening of suggestions this government has come up with yet, and there have been many. I fear for my
freedom and that of the next generation. This is not something Australians should ever have to be concerned with. We are a free
society and value free speech above almost all values. Our soldiers gave their lives to protect our freedoms and many would do it
again. We will never forget! Least We Forget! This is not an empty platitude!!
Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a free and fair society. It is a fundamental value of Australia. Despite denials to the
contrary, the proposed bill will erode this fundamental human right.

Freedom of speech is essential in attempting to discover truth. The whole process of discovery relies on free-flowing information
that can be tested and questioned. There are many instances when society or the government of the day has held to a position or
scientific idea, only to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this essential dialogue.
Are we ready to throw out science too! It’s Not Science if it can’t be challenged! The very definition of science is to question
and test the hypothesis, which is only a theory, and often proved Wrong when challenged!!

The internet has become the ‘town square’ where the latest ideas can be debated. Now people can send factual information
around the world in an instant, as well as spread false ideas.
Governments do this all the time. It’s called propaganda! Having the freedom to debate keeps them in check and is essential for
our own protection from dictatorship.
There are positives and negatives to modern technology. But setting up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer.

This bill is designed to stifle debate. A country with no debate is not a free country! We do not submit to communism, Marxism
or allow the socialists to rule! We are Australia and we are free!!
The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.
