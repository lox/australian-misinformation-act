      "The legislation is seen as authoritarian and an overreach of government power, likening it to regimes in North Korea, Iran, and China.",
      "There is concern about the government's past involvement in censoring debate through 'fact checkers' on social media.",

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The basic premise of this legislation is flawed.",
      "Our society is based on the freedom of ideas and expression of those ideas, and if governments are unable to persuade the people that what they propose is indeed in the best interest of all people, then the system is working.",
      "This proposal has no merit in Australian society, it should be forgotten about immediately, and replaced with legislation that supports the democratic process by allowing the people right of expression."
