Not only would this Bill violate my rights, and the rights of every other Australian citizen, to have freedom of speech, but
it would also place enormous power in the hands of a government agency (Australian Communications and Media
Authority) and the bureaucrats who work in the agency (who are employees of Australian people, not elected
representatives of the Australian people).

The ACMA currently has on it's home page advice such as "Fix your television reception" and "Know the online gambling
rules" - this is good and helpful information, but this government agency hardly has the ability to decide what is
'misinformation and disinformation" by telling the citizens of this country what they can and cannot say or think.

Sadly, over the past few years, it has been the experience of Australian citizens that our government has been the
greatest disseminator of 'misinformation and disinformation'.

We were told by our government that the Covid vaccines were 'safe and effective' and we are now hearing reports that
have found they were neither safe (many have died or been harmed) or effective (this injection did not stop people from
contracting or transmitting the virus).

We were told that 'wearing a mask' would help stop the spread of this virus, and now reports are coming out that tell us
that mask wearing is dangerous for the person wearing the mask.

We were told that lockdowns were essential to stop the spread of this virus, and in the process many people were so
isolated that their mental health suffered terribly - some even resorting to suicide.

All of these messages (misinformation and disinformation) came from our own government!

I understand the ACMA proposes to use 'fact checkers' to help them decide what is misinformation and disinformation.
Once again, over the past few years, 'fact checkers' have been shown to get the 'facts' terribly wrong!

I understand that Australia is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that "Everyone has
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

Why would our government sign something like this and then introduce a bill which goes totally against it? How could
we ever trust our government again?

As I stated at the beginning of my submission, this proposed Bill would have to be one of the most dangerous bills
introduced by an Australian government.

Please reject this bill.

Christine Morrell
