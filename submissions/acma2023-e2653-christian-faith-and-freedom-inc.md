Christian Faith and Freedom (CFF) is a Canberra-based charity which monitors and
disseminates news and analysis of violations of the human rights of Christians in many parts
#### of the world. Verifiable information of injustice - which perpetrators would like to suppress -
must be protected from censorship to prevent persecution from continuing unchallenged.

The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 which proposes to give ACMA new
powers to combat “misinformation and disinformation (which) pose a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy”, threatens freedoms of information,
belief and speech which are foundational to democracy itself.

Australians have every right to expect that our elected government will protect, not
undermine, vital freedoms enshrined in international covenants: the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which Australia
has pledged to uphold.

Australia’s legacy of freedom        - which we have taken for granted        - was not free: it was paid
for at the cost of thousands of young lives on many battlefields; has been fought for in State
and Federal Parliaments and must be defended for future generations.

Most of the individuals with whom CFF is closely associated come from countries with failed
democratic institutions which rely on the excessive control over information        - of the same
kind that is proposed in the Bill       - elevating official narrative over anything that would
contradict it. The Bill represents censorship on a scale that is unprecedented, which is open to
abuse. Like many others, CFF is astounded that such a Bill is proposed in Australia.

Refugees who have fled from the existential threat posed by these oppressive, totalitarian
regimes in their countries of origin are expressing alarm at the rapid erosion of freedom in
Australia. Denunciations of the Christian faith as ‘bigoted’, and the accusation that religion is
the cause of the most harmful forms of discrimination in Australia is causing considerable
distress. Ominous warnings from voices previously silenced by fear and oppression need to
be heard.

In keeping with such mythology, Australia appears to have adopted a distorted approach to
Christians in its immigration policy as illustrated by the recent inability of the current
Ambassador of the International Christian Association, Petr Jasek, to obtain a visitor’s visa.

The situation of Petr Jasek is an example of government falsely maintaining its truth over
manifestly contradictory evidence. Since his release from a brutal Sudanese prison in 2017        -
secured through the combined diplomatic efforts of USA, the EU, and Czech authorities        -
Petr has been granted a visa to visit Australia on two previous occasions when he has inspired

and encouraged thousands by sharing his experience of the presence of Christ which
sustained him during his ordeal and gave him the grace to forgive his abusers...

Giving unelected, unnamed bureaucrats the authority and responsibility to define
‘misinformation and disinformation’ without accountability will almost certainly legitimise
highly subjective judgements which do not satisfy the high standards required in international
law for reducing fundamental rights of freedom of expression. On what grounds is
information deemed to be harmful? Who checks the fact-checkers?

Why are these new powers of effective censorship supposed to be necessary now? Could it be
that information presented by government agencies and the mainstream media on issues of
vital public concern is now being challenged by fresh information which indicates that
‘politically incorrect’ views have subsequently been proven embarrassingly true         - but not
before many people who held them have been vilified; de-platformed; their livelihoods lost;
their personal and professional reputations damaged, and their human rights violated in our
supposedly democratic nation? Uncontested government control of information and
expression easily becomes a tool of totalitarianism.

The exclusion of governments and the mainstream media from the restrictions imposed on
Australian citizens privileges government-authorised content so that it can never be treated as
“misinformation” or “disinformation” even if would qualify in those categories but for the
exclusion. If this asymmetric power is misused, it has the potential to conceal corruption,
profoundly alter public opinion, dictate public policy, and influence elections.

“The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth” is the standard required in courts of law
upon which justice and freedom depend. It is the duty of governments to provide an open
forum in which all views can be freely expressed, robustly debated, and evidence contested in
the courts of public opinion to determine which ones best serve Australia’s interests.

Freedom of information enables Australians to make their own judgements, independent of
government influence. They deserve to be credited with sufficient intelligence, common
sense, and life-experience to do so with wisdom; they do not need officials appointed to
exercise undue authority over them.

This Bill would also give ACMA considerable power to impose draconian fines on providers
#### of digital services which carried ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’. This would lead to
excessive policing of content        - severely restricting freedom of speech, against which there
appears to be no protection or means of appeal for restoration of deleted information.

Even before this proposed legislation has been passed into law, foreign-owned Big Tech
companies have followed government directives and removed social media postings of
respected Australian political commentators and analysts. The Institute of Public Affairs
reports that six posts relating to the Voice to Parliament        - and to censorship itself        - have been
taken down. Facebook has also removed the report of influential Sky News presenter, Peta
Credlin, on the true length (26 pages) of the Uluru Statement, obtained through FOI.

Australian national security depends on vigilant monitoring of posts which incite violence or
present danger to life and property, but all power needs to be exercised with integrity. Senator
Alex Antic’s disclosure earlier this year that the Department of Home Affairs used its anti­

terrorism powers to control social media postings of ordinary Australians is adding to
mounting concern over the violation of personal privacy.

The proposed legislation, presented as providing protection for Australians, clearly indicates
that it is government overreach, betrayal of public trust, and the abuse of authority from
which Australians are most in need of protection.

Thousands who now call Australia home have generational experience of the intense
suffering imposed by totalitarian regimes. They are acutely aware that depriving people of
freedom of speech, and instilling fear of the repercussions for non-compliance with official
directives are the first steps towards depriving people of other vital liberties.

CFF is therefore opposed to the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 2023.

We deeply appreciate this opportunity to express our belief that all Australians have an
unassailable right        - proclaimed in our national anthem        - to remain “one and free”.
