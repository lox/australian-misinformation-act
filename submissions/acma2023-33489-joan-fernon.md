 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 Submitted by: Joan Fernon

In the ACMA bill misinformation is defined as information that is untrue,

misleading, or deceitful which is likely to result in or contribute to harm. While

disinformation is defined as information that is false, misleading, or deceitful

which is shared with intent to mislead; and which has the potential to cause or

contribute to harm.

The draft bill does not however detail how ACMA will determine the truth or

misleading nature of information. Nor does it specify how the intent behind the

information or its potential harm will be determined. This lack of boundaries in

the Bill could be used to silence and criminalise criticism of government

communications, irrespective of supporting evidence. This is a chilling scenario.

A nightmarish glimpse into a dystopian Orwellian future.

Giving a single government appointed body the power to stifle dissenting view

points and critical discourse is a recipe for disaster. When actions of the staff in

such a body can be guided by personal biases, or vested private and

government interests. Intellectual freedom and ongoing critical discourse is a

pre-requisite for a well functioning democracy and the scientific endeavour.

Critical discourse and evaluation of evidence is the only way to test the truth or

otherwise of propositions or theories. Hence the application of this Bill could

promote untested and potentially misinformed narratives.

There are too many examples of totalitarian regimes where, after critical

discourse was extingished, all aspects of the society collapses. But we need only

look at what happened in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, where any

scepticism or critcal discussion of government-backed public health messaging

was labelled as misinformation or disinformation. Unfortunately, with the

passage of time, it has become clear that much of the officially sanctioned

government communication — ranging from the lab leak theory to mask usage,

lockdowns, and the effectiveness of vaccines in stopping transmission — was

riddled with inaccuracies and misdirection, whether by oversight or design. The

use of Ivermectin is another example. Early in the pandemic the TGA asserted

ivermectin was harmful and stopped doctors prescribing it for covid patients.

Not only was the social media discussion of ivermectin treatment protocols

suppressed but ivermectin was described as a horse dewormer which was

dangerous to humans. This is inspite of over 4 billion doses of ivermectin having

been dispensed to people since the late 1970s with almost no side effects; and it

being shown effective as a prophylaxis and as early treatment for COVID by

The proposed ACMA bill is also of constitutional concern. The Bill's provisions

that seek to combat misinformation could be used to infringe on the

constitutional freedom of political communication, which is implied in the

Australian Constitution[1].


# Recommendation: The bill should not be approved. It is not

 possible for a single government body to determine what is

 misinformation or disinformation. The Bill can be used to stifle

 critical discourse and infringe on constituationally enshrined

 freedom of political expression. Rather than suppressing

 misinformation the Bill could promote the rigid adherence to

 untested and misinformed narratives.
