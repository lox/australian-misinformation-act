**NEW ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation**

Comment AGAINST the proposed extended ACMA powers by Sally Clark, Australian Citizen,

.

**Misinformation - disinformation are code words for legal blocking and preventing all criticism and free**
**thought. For stifling innovation. For preventing the vigorous discourse that is absolutely essential for a**
vital, thriving, innovative and advancing society in which all members of society thrive and reach their
full potential!

I am very concerned that the Government is planning to introduce legislation that will control what is
and is not allowed to be discussed in public places. Ultimately this will also overreach into private spaces,
we must not believe that such power, if granted, will ever be reverted or removed.

Who determines what is true and what is false? Are only "government endorsed" narratives permitted
without question? Will these narratives change with each change in political party, or when a deeppocketed influencer pays for the narrative to be changed? Who in Government will determine the
narratives? Will these be internal and appropriate to Australia, or will they come externally as part of
globalization from the WEF, the WHO, the UN. If these narratives are imposed from external parties, as I
am very sure they will be given the current globalist push towards One World Government, isn’t this the
ultimate violation of Australia’s national security, and sovereignty?  It is absolutely no accident that
similar legislation is being proposed or has already been introduced in many nations! Lockstep
suffocating of democracy!

Does this mean that no new ideas will be permitted, no questioning of narratives will be permitted, no
hearing of two or more sides of any issues will be permitted ever again?

Are we entering the new dystopian era apparently predicted in the fiction book "1984", where the
government has a "Ministry of Truth"? And only that "truth" and no other will be permitted?

Today's society has only become so advanced and vibrant because all ideas have been allowed. Vigorous
debate and discourse and exploring of ideas; brainstorming allowing individuals, groups of individuals,
communities, and ultimately society to come up with new ideas, new solutions, and different
approaches to everything!

Such draconian measures being proposed are not needed to "keep people safe", there are plenty of less
inhibitive ways to do that (and criminals can still be caught and hate crimes punished under existing
legislation). Besides which, society has become "too safe", and at a great cost of innovation, thought,
and creativity. We have gotten so concerned with “safety” that we have forgotten that life does come

with mostly minor risks, and that staying safe is also personal responsibility, which the government does
not need to take over. Such draconian measures will be used to crush society.

Who will dare to think or say anything outside the box, let alone experiment and explore
implementation of such ideas, when they know they can fined into oblivion? Which internet provider, or
social media company will even stay in Australia with such draconian, inhibitive, rules in place. No
independent media of any type will be possible. No more independent journalism! Big brother is
watching!

Will every single media outlet say exactly the same thing every day, reading from exactly the same
script? Oh, they are already doing that! They have been doing that across the world, in every nation,
every day, on all mainstream media outlets throughout the pandemic years! All MSM are now following
exactly the same international narratives now over “global burning!”. A little academic research will
show that human driven global warming is but one “school of thought”, and that there is evidence that
supports an opposing narrative where even the presence of global warming is questioned, carbon levels
are not detrimental to the earth, are part of natural cycles, and are temperature and not human-driven;
and pollution is an issue, but not global warming. Such questions and opposing views will be not be
countenanced!

Truly, laws such as are being proposed are a move back into dark days of ignorance and silence. The end
of Australia as a free, innovative, creative, vibrant society!  Shame on the Australian Government! This
is not the Australia I thought it was nor the Australia I want for my children and grandchildren.

The last 3 years of pandemic have shown the incredible danger of silencing counter narratives, of
refusing to hear any alternative voices raising concerns with efficacy and even more importantly safety of
the Covid-19 Vaccines! Those same voices were asking for cost-benefit analyses for all of the pandemic
measures from day 1 and were denied.  Well now those voices have been found to have had valid
points. How much better things could have turned out had their voices also been heard early, instead of
so late. Even now their voices are largely being stifled with mostly non-mainstream media coverage
getting out!

With the WHO Pandemic treaty and now the Global Warming narratives, we can be sure that this
legislation will be used to silence any concerns or criticism, and the people speaking.

I absolutely do not support this expansion of AMCA powers and the proposed new legislation. It needs
to be thrown out!

I believe that the Government needs to divert its actions back to governing and dealing with
international and local matters that need proper large scale co-ordination. Things like managing
international affairs in the interests of Australia, building and maintaining infrastructure, ensure a worldclass education system that grows innovative thinkers, with protection of the people and the land from
large scale corporations whose greed needs to be kept in check!

The government needs to step back and give space for society and people to thrive without
micromanagement of all aspects of their lives as is now being proposed. No to increased controls!

Thank you!

Sally Clark
