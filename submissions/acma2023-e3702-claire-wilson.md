To whom it may concern
I am Deeply concerned about censorship regulations. On some level lies and trickery has to have some way of being made
accountable.
However the complexities in attempting to do this are endless and almost impossible.

Every human is different and has different experiences. What works for someone may not work for someone else. What
makes sense to someone may not make sense to someone else.

The concern is that if a third party body or government try and be the determining agent that decides what is misinformation,
then we are heading for dangerous times.
There is no government or third party agent who is wise enough, or researched enough to determine final truths on anything.

Government lies and spreads misinformation all the time. Which government authorized administration will debunk
government lies ??? We can’t even get class actions or investigations into corruption settled openly without negotiations
being made behind the scenes and public oblivious to the outcome.

Government and third party control is useless because we don't all Share the same opinions or have the same awareness.

We already have established ratings like PG : M : R etc and even this small attempt to restrict content has become almost
null and void with the new digital culture.

It is impossible to use censorship as a way forward. It will be misused without a doubt.
We need to brainstorm other effective ways of balancing truth from lies and I think the only way to do that is to stop
marketing algorithms that keep you locked into similar information.
Make sure we have room for healthy debate.
Give people incentives to watch healthy debate. Make it more common place for citizens, government and corporations to
hold open debates where theories, ideas, agendas can be questioned and explained.
Let people make up their own mind.

#### If anything maybe just stop CGI footage and actors being used to confuse and trick people. Other than that all the cards need
to be on the table!

Yours sincerely
