Whoever has influence over the dissemination of knowledge also has control over people's

minds. It is important to exercise caution while deciding whether to allow for or enforce the

censorship of information and history. It has the potential to be corrupted and can have

disastrous effects on society.

It is essential for people to be able to express themselves freely in society and for others to

be able to do so without fear of censorship. The development of new discoveries and

innovative ideas frequently results from an open mind and free thinking. It would be tragic if

social engineering brought on by censorship conditioned future generations out of this

creative state.

Having freedom of expression is vital for the healthy development of individuals on both a

psychological and emotional level. It is also healthy for people to develop the ability of

discernment by having access to different viewpoints on a subject rather than merely

interpreting or accepting what is offered to them from one side of a narrative (or narrow

perspective). Based on their own perception of life, people should have the freedom to

choose for themselves whatever parts of the information they receive from diverse sources

are appropriate for them. Discernment is a crucial skill that should be allowed to be

developed and shouldn't be curtailed by censorship. Any topic should be open to many

interpretations and points of view, as this is crucial. Each person views a scenario differently

because of their own intellectual growth or life experiences.

An observation made over the past few decades has demonstrated that commercial

organisations like "Professional News" can be heavily prejudiced in favour of their revenue

sources, which include shareholders and advertisers. They will never release information

that would be harmful to their business interests. Information that would be harmful to

professional news organisations' shareholders or advertisers is significantly more likely to be

withheld. People will be led to believe anything published for business reasons, even if it is

untrue if commercial organisations are not HELD ACCOUNTABLE for the information they

publish to society. Because accountability is so crucial, no organisation should be exempt.

If the government believes that imposed censorship is the only viable option, it should be

implemented without making any exceptions for particular organisations or commercial

entities. No business or organisation ought to be exempt from the law. Equal responsibility

for one's conduct should apply to everyone. All publishers should be treated the same way 
no exemptions (no chance of corruption for financial gain or power).

If this bill is introduced, the development of newer technologies may be stifled if commercial

platforms dubbed as "Professional News" are permitted to broadcast news material in the

interests of their shareholders and advertisers without any ACCOUNTABILITY. Major

commercial news organisations should be subjected to the same scrutiny and objective

evaluation that is enforced on others.

Fact checking should be conducted in a way that there is no chance of prejudice. A

transparent fact-checking procedure is necessary to prevent fact manipulation and to ensure

accountability. Such information control needs to be strictly regulated to avoid fabrications

and misinformation, especially in commercial publications or those whose publishers stand

to profit financially from the information they disseminate.
