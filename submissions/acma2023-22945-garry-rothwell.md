I wish to make a submission regarding the Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
There is no evidence to demonstrate the necessity for this bill which seeks to outsource to mainly
foreign-owned digital media groups the right and responsibility for censoring what Australians can
read, say, hear or see on line.
On the contrary, there is ample and growing evidence that the digital companies have already been
censoring speech on a variety of subjects and have been doing so on some occasions in collusion
with government agencies both in the US and Australia.

The guidance Notes state that ACMA is to strike a reasonable balance between freedom of speech
and the risk of harm. There is no evidence of how this balance will be achieved or measured nor is
there any apparent means of ensuring the obligation is met. History would indicate that any
bureaucratic entity established to monitor free speech will do so with increasing rigour to the
disadvantage of the ordinary citizen. Such entities will also staunchly resist efforts to either examine
their activities or call them to account.
Digital media companies exhibit little in the way of transparency or accountability.

The Bill provides that ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be removed
from digital platform services but rules made under the Bill may require digital platform services to
have systems and processes in place to address misinformation or disinformation that meets a
threshold of being likely to cause or contribute to serious harm. This operates to outsource the
definition and monitoring of what constitutes misinformation and/or disinformation to foreign
entities. Not only are they alien to the Australian culture and legal system they are wholly
unaccountable to the Australian electorate. The likelihood of ACMA having any effective control is
remote. Indeed, efforts by US companies to restrict free speech may well be unconstitutional in
their home environment and ultimately illegal.

Claims of "harm" engendered by mere speech seem to emanate from universities railing against
Western civilisation and reducing all problems to the “racism of white colonisation”.
No unavoidable harm can flow from information, misinformation or disinformation. On a Web sitethere is already a perfect defence: the off switch. Those who can't or won't exercise this simple harm
management tool, or undertake prudent research should not cry to the Government to protect them
from their folly and in so doing limit the information available to other more discerning users of
information services.

The proposed legislation will have a chilling effect on expressing opinions involving controversial
political subjects such as climate change, pandemic management, trans-gender issues, the voice and
social problems arising from mass immigration.
It is outrageous that the bill seeks to exclude government and bureaucracy at all levels when history
and recent behaviour confirms these areas are the most likely sources of deliberate misinformation
or disinformation.
For example, Linda Burnie, Minister for Indigenous Affairs, in addressing the voice proposal, has
repeatedly insisted that people supporting the “No” case are introducing “Trump style politics” into
Australia and are guilty of misinformation and disinformation. This is weaponising the Bill before it is
legislated by clearly signalling to digital media and ACMA that they should be censoring those who
speak against the voice.
TV viewers are inundated with Government sponsored ads typifying the forthcoming referendum as
being all about” inclusion and recognition” without actually mentioning the voice. This is clearly a
cynical response to polling showing that the Australian community overwhelmingly supports
recognition in the constitution but is increasingly opposed to the voice component. It is deliberately

misleading.
Despite her responsibilities for indigenous affairs, the minister has for years falsely asserted that she
was once counted as flora and fauna and that she was not counted as a citizen until 1967. These
claims have been repeatedly debunked by “fact checkers”, including the ABC.  Why, as a
government minister, is she to be exempted from deliberately spreading such misinformation?

Before you dismiss these thoughts as the delusions if a fevered right wing imagination, it is
instructive to note the breadth of opposition expressing doubts about the proposal: ACMA itself, the
Australian Human Rights Commission, most mainstream media and several of the digital
corporations involved.
My recommendation is that the Bill be withdrawn in its entirety.

Yours sincerely,

Garry Rothwell
