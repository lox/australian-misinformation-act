To whom it may concern

I am against censorship of opinions because:-

We see our debating floors of Parliament constantly misused.
A Member asks a legitimate question of Government, representing their electorate.
The question does not get answered

It is taken on notice and more commonly now does not get responded to.
Government wastes time, ridicules the Member, goes off topic and fails to answer.
Withholding the truth is as good as lying.
Truth, no matter how unpalatable, is truth!
You don’t solve problems by using mistruths to make decisions.
European Parliament questioned a Pfizer representative.
She admitted Pfizer DID NOT test their vaccine would stop transmission.
Yet our Government still tells us to get boosted to protect ourselves and those around us.

Fact is, the official narrative has intentionally or unintentionally been misleading and has cost many lives.
Meanwhile, many accurate and qualified opinions were wrongly suppressed.
Pfizer's own documents were initially sealed for 70 years.
A U.S. Freedom of information request saw the Pfizer document released.
Those documents showed approximately 1400 deaths in the U.S. int he first 10 weeks from Pfizer’s vaccine!
The TGAs Database of Adverse Event Notifications for Astra Zenica, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines shows masses of
serious side effects, including death, yet the public is being told otherwise.
The TGA has recently released a warning about Curcumin and Turmeric over just ONE death and about 10 reported
serious complications. The Covid vaccines have are officially shown to be far more dangerous, yet Australians were
forced out of jobs and treated unjustly for refusing those vaccines.
About 10 months ago, Dr Kerryn Phelps stated she and her partner had serious side effects from the vaccines -also,
that Doctors were being prevented from sharing what they had witnessed from the vaccines.

First line Health Workers were also being prevented from talking of what they witnessed.

I saw one interview where an Adelaide Nurse stated they had 38 people in ICU -33 of them were fully vaccinated. At
that time, South Australia had closed borders and virtally no Covid!
Strongly implicated, were the vaccines!
Suppressing the truth is as good as lying.
If we don’t listen to ALL opinions, we will miss solutions and the "mistakes" made will be covered up to save face, hide
corrupt behaviour or deliberately mislead Australians into wrong, even deadly decisions.
Government has shown they don’t deal in facts or truth very well.
They cannot be trusted to decide what is truth and what is not.
We have rules about misleading Parliament.
That is because experience shows Politicians may be compromised and cover up dishonesty.
Yet they want to be the ones to censor facts -they cannot always be trusted.

In the 1930s, Walter Froggett was the one lone voice speaking against the release of cane toads in Australia. All the
know it all "experts" opposed him.
Look at the problem we have today -he was right and was ignored    - look at the consequences today!

I am against people who refuse to hear others' points of view.

I am against silencing what may well turn out to be truth.
Censorship is a very dangerous power in the wrong hands. How qualified and in what field are the “board members”
who are making the decisions of whether information is misinformation or disinformation or is it factual scientific
evidence? Is the truth a threat to the decisions already made??
AUSTRALIANS CANNOT AFFORT THE RISK OF HAVING UNQUALIFIED AND UNEXPERIENCED LESS
EDUCATED PEOPLE FOLLOWING A RHETORIC TO FOLLOW ORDERS THAT MAY VERY WELL BE TOTALLY
INACCURATE, UNSCIENTIFIC FACTUAL INFORMATION WHICH MAY VERY WELL CONTINUE TO HARM OUR
POPULATION!

The Act to Control    - Misinformation and Disinformation in an effort to Silencing and would potentially obtain variable

results.

governance.

Totalitarian and draconian measures suppress people and certainly is this what the government is perceived to

pursue

The question is: what is the definition of Misinformation and Disinformation and who ultimately decides who is right

and who is wrong when one can be wrong being right and right being wrong or is it wrong being right and right being

wrong or both can be wrong and right. Who is the dictator that also can be maligned to blindly portraying

misinformation or disinformation that may not be in the best interests of the people concerned?

It is quite ironic that the Government is portraying the voice for Indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and

silencing the Australian citizens who need to know and understand and work together as equals. Fundamental what is

misinformation or disinformation and a lack of information and a need to understand therefore to comprehend and

make sense of the situation.

For example, the Government may **with** **intent** **provide** **a** **lack** **of** **information** that can also be misinterpreted as

misinformation or disinformation with an outcome of misunderstanding. This would lead to an outcome in not able to

voice or defend oneself with a government using totalitarian tactics. Thereby one could be apprehended without ever

committing a crime.

Although the language of equal opportunity is only perceived, the ideals of being in a democratic society may however

operate as a potent form of _silencing_ with variable results: So in an event or situation in which the Government is

challenged by an alternative truth will be condemned

**_“The_** **_further_** **_that_** **_society_** **_drifts_** **_away_** **_from_** **_the_** **_truth,_** **_die_** **_more_** **_it_** **_hates_** **_for_** **_those_** **_that_** **_speak_** **_out_** **_“_** **_-George_** **_Orwell_**

_“There_ _is_ _no_ _such_ _thing_ _as_ _“disinformation”_ _or_ _“misinformation”_ _or_ _“malinformation”._ _There_ _is_ _only_ _information._ _There_ _is_

_information_ _you_ _accept_ _and_ _information_ _you_ _do_ _not_ _accept._ _You_ _were_ _not_ _born_ _with_ _a_ _requirement_ _to_ _believe_ _everything_

_you_ _are_ _told;_ _rather,_ _you_ _were_ _born_ _with_ _a_ _brain_ _that_ _allows_ _you_ _to_ _process_ _the_ _information_ _you_ _receive_ _and_ _make_

_independent_ _decisions._

_When_ _you_ _accept_ _the_ _terms_ _“disinformation”,_ _“misinformation”_ _or_ _the_ _newest_ _lingo,_ _“malinformation,”_ _you_ _are_ _beginning_

_to_ _categorize_ _truth_ _and_ _lies_ _in_ _various_ _shades._ _You_ _are_ _“merging_ _black_ _and_ _white,_ _right_ _and_ _wrong,_ _into_ _various_ _shades_

##### of grey,” - from Endless Pursuit.

So one must question what is the fate of Law in our society with the Governments that portray a monopoly on

people’s lives through deprivation and fear using tactics of confusion and mind control. In addition unbeknown to the

population, the dependency of Technology, pathways of monitoring and surveillance to control without consent. All

people have an obligation to help protect the people who cannot help themselves to our best ability.

removed from standing up and having a voice and silenced, by grooming with mental and physical tactics without

informed consent agreeing to the terms of enslavement.

What is so often seen is that People can be brain washed in being used and obeying or being bought by institutions

Governments or Billionaires or unelected bureaucrats that have a vested interest in any situation. By obeying, one is

made to feel important but in the next breath spat out, deleted and no longer needed. Your voice will not be heard

Then/When at what point does one speak up that is the question. Where there are fundamental areas that the

government have not considered as their duty to stand up for the people that have put them into their position to

protect the people? It is not about enslavement. It is not about silencing. It is about being open and transparent It is

about information. It is about facts, honesty and integrity.
