(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

**Universal Declaration of Human Rights**
Article 18  Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to
change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to
manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

Article 19   Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontier

The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives all humans the right of free speech. It is a
cornerstone of democracy which should be cherished and promoted rather than controlled and diminished. You only
have to look at the dictatorships of the current political world where there is no freedom of speech and those who
support it are usually in jail or dead.

My concern with the proposed legislation is that it gives government the opportunity to suppress legitimate political
dissent as being labeled misinformation because it is contrary to government policy. As the Australian Human Rights
Commission has stated” There is a real risk that efforts to combat online misinformation and disinformation by
foreign actors could be used to legitimize attempts to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinion and enforce
ideological conformity in Australia”. We have already seen this occur in the public arena where people of faith who
have expressed a viewpoint different to the LGBTQI agenda have been accused of promoting hate speech when in
fact it is just a different point of view. As Winston Churchill once said, “Everyone is in favor of free speech. Hardly a
day passes without its being extolled, but some people's idea of it is that they are free to say what they like, but if
anyone else says anything back, that is an outrage”.

If the Government or its bureaucracy is given the power to enforce their own political views and penalize anyone
who gives a different opinion then free speech in our country no longer exists. Whether the government chooses to
do this themselves or compel public platforms to conform because of the threat of massive fines then our ability as a
nation to discuss, debate and learn from that debate has been diminished. We are then no longer a democracy when
truth is decided by the government of the day whatever their persuasion.

Truth is absolute. Postmodern relativism says that I can have my truth and you can have your truth and we can both
be right. Unfortunately this is impossible. Government does not have the monopoly on truth as we have seen over
the last decades a succession of politicians who have appeared before the courts on various charges using related to
not telling the truth but using their political power to gain favour and wealth at the expense of truth. It is worthwhile
noting that the official newspaper of the Communist Government of the USSR for most of the 20[th] Century was
“Pravda” which ironically means truth. And I am quite sure that it was anything but true.

Governments are elected to serve all the people not just those who vote for them. To stifle debate because
someone disagrees is no better than the school yard bully who enforces his rule of authority by beating up anyone
who disagrees. So too is a government who choose to bully the population into ideological conformity by penalizing
people or public platforms who have the temerity to put forward a dissenting point of view. To me this sounds like a
page out of Pravda!

In brief I am not in support of this legislation as I most strongly believe that it is backward step in maintaining our
democratic freedoms of which one of the most important is freedom of speech.
