From what I have observed this type of legislation does not serve the average Australian but big government. Governments change and
their values and opinions vary - what was truth yesterday according to one political side is lies tomorrow!
We online users are more able to work out the truth for ourselves we do not need the big hand of government censorship.

Lets look at Covid as an example - one day it is a untruth to say the vax dos not protect everyone and my taking or not has no impact
on others. The next week themselves admit they never tested the vax to stop transmission and now we know that it does not!
Thousands of scientists and medical experts were silenced because they did not speak what the governments wanted people to hear
and now we know and others conspired to lie and change the facts - and how did we learn these things - from free online
discussion across many platforms - this legislation would have enabled politicians to persuade the media platforms to suppress such
information even more than they did during covid. As we have learned they put pressure and did deals with facebook and twitter all
through the pandemic!!!

This must never happen again! Politicians who spoke against the government were often denied access to social media because they
knew that the current government would not like to hear a different opinion!! THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY!!!!
