Australian Communications and Media Authority Bill 2023
In Australia we have a community of mixes of culture, religions and minds, which I believe
makes us one of the best communities in the World.
We encourage the minds/brains of people to develop and grow. We have far left-thinking
people, far right-thinking people and the majority of people, like us, are people who are
somewhere in the middle, or as some people would say "straight down the line" Centre
Thinkers.
Recently a lot of time and money has been spent to extend the internet to far reaches of our
great country. Everybody should have the choice on what they can read/not read, write/not
write, enjoy or ignore while exploring our wonderful internet. Parents have the opportunity to
educate themselves and their families on what they believe is right and wrong. Individuals
can also educate themselves. We know that some things are just too good to be true and
ignore them.
It is our God given right to educate ourselves. Not everything is black and white, there are
more than fifty shades of grey.
Advertising on TV leads us to believe that what is being sold is good for our health but some
of us choose not to eat that product until we have read the ingredients and nutrition
information. Then we may eat it or may not. So, we don't just believe what we are being told
but seek more information.
We want to know more, this is part of our makeup/DNA, to question what we are being told.
What suits one person doesn't necessarily suit all. When it comes to our knowledge or
wanting to learn, "one size fits all" just does not work.
We also learn from experience, good or bad. People / the government make mistakes,
history is written and we move on, learning all the time.
ACMA is not qualified to say that what a Doctor or Professor, etc publishes on the internet is
correct or not. Their peers may read that same thing, realise a mistake and discover a
solution for "stupidness". Who knows!!
I may publish a photo of the "beautiful" blanket I have made and others will think it "ugly".
We all have different opinions and unless we are exposed to "beautiful" and "ugly" how do
we know there are differences.
Forget new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation and let us
AUSTRALIANS carry on deciding what we read/not read, write/not write, enjoy or ignore on
the internet and let us make our own minds on what is misinformation and disinformation or
truth. This is exactly what People do when there is a Federal or State Election!
