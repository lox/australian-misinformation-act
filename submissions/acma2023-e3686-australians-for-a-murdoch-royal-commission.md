**About Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission**

Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission (AFMRC) is a non-partisan association

committed to researching and advocating for media diversity in Australia. Our core

objective is for legal reform to ensure a strong, free and diverse Australian media.

We believe that only a Royal Commission would have the powers and independence

needed to properly investigate media concentration and behaviour in Australia, and

make the necessary recommendations for media regulation that is fit for purpose in

the digital era, including combatting mis- and disinformation.

Our campaign has demonstrated an unprecedented level of public support with more

than 500,000 people signing Australia’s largest ever petition calling for a Royal

Commission into Australian media diversity.

We thank the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,

Communications and the Arts for the opportunity to make a submission on the

proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

_Disinformation) Bill 2023._


**Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission Submission on the**


-----

**Executive Summary**

AFMRC welcomes the government’s recognition that Australia is in urgent need of

new regulation to combat the spread of mis- and disinformation online and that the

ACMA is currently ill-equipped to deal with the issue.

However, we are concerned that the bill as drafted will be largely ineffective in

combating mis- and disinformation. Our concerns are based on the fact that:

1. Digital platforms have an appalling track record of self-regulating mis- and

disinformation. We do not believe that any co-regulation model between

government and industry can effectively combat online mis- and

disinformation.

2. Some of the most damaging mis- and disinformation is generated at the

intersection of demonstrably false content that is produced by professional

news outlets and the online spaces where this content is spread. Any

regulatory attempt to combat online mis- and disinformation must recognise

this dynamic, which this legislation currently fails to do.

We also argue that the ACMA is currently unfit for purpose and the additional

resources and powers proposed in this bill will be insufficient to build the capability

and public trust needed to perform this crucial role. The ACMA has repeatedly

proven itself unable to fulfil its current role of online and broadcast media regulation.

The Australian public would be better served by the establishment of an independent

media regulator with substantial resourcing and appropriate powers to combat the

dissemination of mis- and disinformation.

**Ineffectiveness of co-regulation and relying on digital platforms to**

**combat mis- and disinformation**

Despite the ACMA’s shortcomings, we support the ACMA being given the power to

request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to combat

misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, and that the ACMA be given


-----

the power to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation),

should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combating misinformation and

disinformation on digital platforms.

While we welcome these increased requirements on digital platforms, we do not

believe that combatting mis- and disinformation is something that can be effectively

dealt with by industry-lead self-regulation. As noted in the submission from the

Human Rights Law Centre, digital platforms have repeatedly demonstrated they are

incapable of self-regulation with disastrous consequences around the world.

We are concerned that this bill, as drafted, leaves an incredibly important function as

the joint responsibility between multinational tech platforms that profit from

algorithms that privilege anger inducing content and an Australian regulator that has

proven woefully ineffective in even its current functions.

**How ‘professional news’ spreads mis- and disinformation**

There is an enormous body of evidence demonstrating the way that mis- and

disinformation is disseminated by the Murdoch Press before it is spread and

distributed in online spaces, with devastating results. A recent high profile example

of this was the role Fox News played in spreading disinformation about the

legitimacy of the 2020 US election which culminated in an attempted coup and attack

on the US Capitol.

As currently drafted, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 fails to recognise this incredibly_

destructive and dangerous dynamic by excluding ‘professional news’ from the scope

of the proposed industry standards. Given the political and societal damage that is

regularly inflicted by the Murdoch Press, which would fall under this bill’s definition of

‘professional news’, this is a concerning regulatory shortcoming.

Rather than being excluded from attempts to combat mis- and disinformation,

professional outlets such as Sky News must be regulated to more stringent

standards of mis- and disinformation than general online content.


-----

The presence of known media brands or mastheads, coupled with signs of

legitimacy that come from a significant budget (for example professional graphic

design or high production value video segments), imbue audiences with an

automatic sense of trust. News Corp systemically uses these signifiers of legitimate

journalism to mask the spread of mis- and disinformation, which is arguably more

damaging than user generated mis- and disinformation and online content that

cannot be traced to a direct source.

The Murdoch Press plays a clear role in disseminating dangerous mis- and

disinformation that permeates beyond fringe, radical online spaces and into

mainstream debates.

We have detailed below some of the most egregious examples of News Corp’s mis
and disinformation, including some insights from research AFMRC has

commissioned to observe the role the Murdoch Press in playing in spreading

anti-Voice mis- and disinformation in the lead up to the referendum.

However, we would like to emphasise that this set of examples is far from exhaustive

as the sheer volume of mis- and disinformation spread by the Murdoch Press is near

impossible to document.

**Fox News’ role in the January 6 riots**

The role that Fox News, American sister company to Sky News Australia, played in

the January 6 2021 riots in Washington DC has been extensively analysed and

documented, with a trove of evidence being presented in the Dominion Voting

Systems defamation proceedings.

Given the enormous amount of high-profile commentary that already exists, this

submission will not go into extensive detail on the matter. However, we would like to

note that:


-----

 - Fox News knowingly perpetrated Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 US

Presidential election was stolen.[1]

 - The role that Fox News played in platforming and legitimising this lie played a

significant role in the devastating events that transpired on January 6 2021.[2]

 - There are substantial parallels between Fox News and Sky News Australia in

terms of a shared business model that is premised on creating fear and

division, increasingly radical editorial agendas, and a systematic disregard for

basic journalistic standards.

Accordingly, we believe that the events of January 6 2021 are relevant to any

regulatory discussion about how mis- and disinformation spread by professional

news outlets should be regulated in Australia. This is a clear cut example of how

dangerous mis- and disinformation from the Murdoch Press can be and we urgently

need strong new regulatory mechanisms to protect Australia from similar outcomes.

**Sky News Australia’s dissemination of COVID disinformation**

In recent years, Sky News Australia has pursued an aggressive YouTube strategy.

The most radical content from their broadcast programs is packaged up, often with

highly inflammatory titles, into short video clips that are available online. At the time

of writing, Sky News Australia has 3.49 million YouTube subscribers which is more

than ABC News and 7News combined.[3]

We would like to draw attention to the role that Sky News’ YouTube channel played

in spreading COVID disinformation and use it to illustrate why platform-lead attempts

to combat mis- and disinformation are ineffective.

1. At the height of the pandemic, Sky news released a series of videos

promoting COVID disinformation on their Youtube channel.[4] After an

onslaught of escalating misinformation and complaints, YouTube eventually

suspended Sky’s channel. However, the account was only suspended for 7

days and the offending videos were ultimately broadcast live to millions

without consequence.Despite the fact that YouTube actually took action

against Sky News’ COVID disinformation, their actions were insufficient in

limiting the damage.

2. Sky news routinely employed “experts” to mislead viewers and spread

disinformation. For example, Sky’s ‘Outsiders’ program aired on 11 December

2022 featured a naturopath – Mark Sherwood – giving his “medical opinion”

on matters of immunology. The hosts also referred to Sherwood as “doctor”

multiple times. Sky later placed a small correction on a rarely accessed page

of their website confirming that Sherwood was not in fact a doctor, but this

does nothing to address the harm done to people who took the advice.[5]

Clearly, a major news media outlet spreading health misinformation during a global

pandemic has the potential to cause serious harm and it is unlikely that we will ever

truly know the extent of the damage done by Sky News Australia’s coverage during

this period. We would like to note that while YouTube did take some welcome steps

towards trying to stymie this flow of mis- and disinformation, those efforts were

ultimately insufficient in combating its detrimental impacts.

**The Murdoch Press’ anti-Voice disinformation**

AFMRC has commissioned the Murdoch Referendum Accountability Project to

investigate the role the Murdoch Press is playing in the public debate leading up to

the Voice referendum. This work is being lead by Dr Victoria Fielding who is

managing a team of three media experts at the University of Adelaide.

A random sample of 126 pieces of Voice-related content from The Australian, The

Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph and Sky News YouTube are being analysed each

week. This rigorous analysis takes place at the word-specific level and looks at voice

and sources used and included, arguments used and any characterisations present.

The project is currently in the early stages with only three weeks of analysis currently

completed. However, there are a few key insights that are relevant to this

submission. AFMRC would welcome the opportunity to present the project’s full

findings after the referendum.

When it comes to the Voice, there is a clear divide between the journalistic standards

applied by News Corp’s reporters (for example Rosie Lewis and Paige Taylor) in

comparison to its more radical commentators (for example Andrew Bolt and Peta

Credlin). Unlike Voice coverage from News Corp’s reporters, which has tended

towards being balanced and well researched, much of the content generated by

high-profile commentators has been premised on misinformation. We are concerned

that this bill would extend projections intended for legitimate journalism to such

commentators as they fall under the banner of ‘professional news’ as currently

defined in this bill.

As is detailed in the graphs below, commentators Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin are

by far News Corp’s most prolific producers (by word) on this particular issue. While

we do not currently have data to apply to other issues areas, we believe that it would

be illuminating to see if this same dynamic is present in News Corp’s coverage of

other contentious political issues.


-----

We are concerned that, as drafted, the Communications Legislation Amendment

_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 would fall short in_

combating mis- and disinformation that is disseminated online by Murdoch Media

commentators.

The graph below provides a breakdown of the Murdoch Press’ most used arguments

against the Voice. Those marked in red are the arguments that are highly-reliant on

misinformation.


-----

In some instances, News Corp gives a platform to external sources in order to

spread this misinformation, but in others News Corp commentators play a clear role

in creating the misinformation in the first place. An especially egregious example of

this is Peta Credlin’s recent claim that the Uluru Statement from the Heart is not one,

but twenty six pages long. This specific example is explored in more detail below.

**Case study: Sky News misinformation regarding the Uluru Statement**

The claim that the Uluru Statement from the Heart is not one but 26 pages long is

clearly and demonstrably false. We have provided substantial evidence on this point

in Appendix A and would like to note that we will be submitting this information as a

complaint to both Southern Cross and to the ACMA.

This misinformation was generated by Sky News commentator Peta Credlin, who, as

the data above demonstrates, is one of the Murdoch Press’ most prolific content

creators on the Voice. It is fair to say that given News Corp’s dominance in the

Australian media landscape and Peta Credlin’s prominent position within the News

Corp ecosystem, that she is one of the most platformed contributors to the public

debate surrounding the referendum.


-----

Even fellow Sky News commentator Chris Kenny spoke out against this

misinformation saying that “[Credlin’s claims] are simply untrue… All this focus on

conspiracies instead of actual arguments is the very definition of a fear

campaign…There are some rational arguments against the Voice. I just don’t buy

them. But the scare campaigns, the conspiracy theories and the fear mongering

should stop.. We’ve got to call out the scares and centre on the reality”.[6]

We recognise that Meta, based on advice from RMIT Fact Lab, did label some of

Sky News’ content on this matter as misinformation.[7] However, News Corp continues

to perpetrate this falsehood across multiple outlets, demonstrating that even when

digital platforms attempt to intervene on mis- and disinformation spread by

professional news outlets, it is largely ineffective.

**Recommendations**

While AFMRC welcomes the government’s recognition that stronger regulation is

needed to combat the spread of mis- and disinformation online, we do not believe

that this bill as drafted will achieve its stated objectives. In order to strengthen

_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and_

_Disinformation) Bill 2023 we recommend that:_

1. There be a move away from co-regulatory models when regulators oversee

codes of practice put in place by digital platforms. Instead, regulators should

be empowered to both create and enforce standards.

2. The government recognise that ‘professional news’, and in particular the

Murdoch Press, plays a major role in the mis- and dis-information ecosystem.

Rather than being excluded from new regulation initiatives, ‘professional

news’ should be held to a higher standard of truth than general online content.

We acknowledge that a major overhaul of Australia’s online and broadcast media

regulator is an enormously complex task. We do not advocate a specific approach or

model for this beyond that a new regulator should be independent, adequately

resourced, and have appropriate powers to fulfil its function including the ability to

hold media companies to account for irresponsibly platforming disinformation.

AFMRC believes that only a Royal Commission will have the independence and

powers to properly gather evidence about the role that the media plays in

disseminating mis- and disinformation, and to recommend appropriate reforms.
