RE: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications
Legislation Amendment[Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill 2023)

To Whom It May Concern

I am writing to express my gravest of concerns at the above-named bill.
I am gobsmacked at the intention of the bill which is anti-thesis to democracy and the
principles of a democratic country of which Australia is.
I am concerned that this draconian backward taking step will remove “human” rights and
privileges and be in direct contravention of the International Covenant of Civil and Political
Rights, to which Australian Government is a signatory!

The terminology of “misinformation” and “disinformation” is entirely in hidden! You are
pushing a Bill on the Australian People without any details of what exactly that looks like on
paper. Exact details of these terminologies please otherwise it’s an open backdoor for the
Government to restrict the People!  May I remind you as Public Servants you serve the
People, not the WEF, UN, WHO or any other privately held corporations etc etc.
At no point in the discussions of these Draft Rules of the Bill, the Bill does not make clear
who will be responsible for determining what constitutes mis or disinformation and serious
harm. These terms aren’t defined so are clearly meaningless and could be open to serious
abuse.

I can’t imagine why you would expect the Australia people to accept this Bill when we have
just undergone the coronavirus fiasco over the last 3 years. The seriousness of the
Coronavirus where Government happily provides it’s own People with misinformation on
“safety” and “efficacy” of Trialled Biochemical mRNA Injections called Vaccines and millions
of us have been damaged physically, mentally and financially!

I say “NO” to the Draft Bill. It threatens our democracy, the right of citizens to hold and
express opinions and to seek information from a wide diversity of sources.

This Draft Bill is pushing Australian People towards Totalitarianism.
Australians do not need Government to protect us from information; Government’s role is
to protect the People’s Human Rights, the word Human the most important here. We are
not artificial life forms. We can think for ourselves!

Your Sincerely

Helen Stickley
