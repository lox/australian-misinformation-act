Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

The Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill is proposing to address a significant problem
facing the community at large:

The serious harm that can result from misinformation or disinformation.

This submission claims the Bill is based on an incoherent basis for acting against mis/disinformation
in 4 areas.

First, the recognition of mis/disinformation can involve deep subtleties that cannot be easily
addressed without broad consultation. This issue alone should be seen as a reason to question the
structure of the Bill.

Second, the whole idea of exempting actors such as government and news media should (and does)
raise alarms.

Third, the proposal that the decision to act against perceived mis/disinformation is left to the
internet providers amounts to “privatisation” of the most important part of the endeavour.

Fourth, the prospect of penalising huge international corporations deserves an entire examination of
available powers via legislation

The problem of mis/disinformation is an important one. But it deserves much closer examination.

This submission is to request the government retracts the Bill in order to address the above, after
which it may be appropriate to proceed.
