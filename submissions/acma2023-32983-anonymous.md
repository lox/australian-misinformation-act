Parliamentary Submission – Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

I write in regards to the Government’s plan to impose measures to restrict the voice and expression
of Australian citizens and residents through arbitrary determination of the veracity of information via
the proposed above Bill.

The core issues pertaining to this Bill is that it not only restricts but fundamentally removes freedom
of speech (an implied Constitutional guarantee), being a philosophical tenet of Australia as a Western
liberal society.

The Bill is vague in its definition of what constitutes ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ and allows
unbounded capacity for the application of impulsive and discretional judgements. The Bill also
provides undefined breadth and scope for application on the narrative and detail of any subject
matter from this time forwards of which the Government of the day, its agencies, international
partners or organizations seek to enforce. This runs counter to the principle of transparency and
deems that the public be consulted with an official message on a ‘what you need to know only’ basis.

It also allows for the dismissal of accountability by outsourcing the determination of ‘truth’ to the
regulatory authority, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to impose
sanctions on digital providers and users of platforms. The inevitable result and I suspect, intention
will be that ACMA’s determination of truth and approved narratives on important issues do not
depart from the messaging objectives decreed by the Government.

The proposed legislation provides for a dominion of absolute arbitrary power for potential selective
use (and abuse) to approve only sanctioned information for sharing with opinion or commentary.
This disables that once cherished ideal of considered debate within a robust democracy and runs
counter to Western liberal principles that have been the basis of Australia’s public sphere of open
communication once demonstrated with pride by the publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC.

As has happened through history inconvenient truths have been in the past silenced only to be
recognised as having a basis in fact years or decades later e.g. The health dangers of aspartame,
safety of materials, medicines, building products etc., or wars against foreign nations based on
incorrect evidence, such as Iraq’s non-existent arsenal of WMDs when at the relevant period of time
viewpoints that were contrary to the assertive presentation of information by Western Governments
were deemed as mis-information.

If Government were to have powers provided by passage of this Bill, in a future similar scenario to
the above example (i.e. at a time of war or military engagement) any person expressing an opinion
contrary to the sanctioned official narrative with information on media platforms would likely be
deemed as sharing misinformation and potentially accused of ‘siding’ or ‘aiding the enemy’, maybe
even then deemed an ‘enemy combatant’. Even if that person’s desire was not to see half a million
innocent people murdered on a false premise and for wider strategic and geo-political intentions.

Similarly, ACMA already pre-supposes misinformation in its study recommendations as being from
supporters of particular groups using judgemental and discriminatory labels and tags rather than any
critical argument. Already ACMA has shown its impartial stance and displayed how it will operate
with pernicious judgement if and when given the powers under this proposed Bill. Fair and open
debate and critical argument with arbitrary definition of the ‘facts’ will be the forever normal.

Rather than being binary positions on issues there can a range of diverse perspectives based on
various sources of information that provide a far more nuanced interpretation on matters with
deeper intellectual consideration calling for critical thinking skills than the simple narrative echoed
across corporate major media or government media channels presenting a black and white, ‘we

good, they bad’ contrast. Where if one disagrees with the majority view then one is derided with
name calling label abuse. Is that a democracy? Where expression of a diversity of view is forbidden?

Life under this proposed legislation would mean that an opinion such as ‘Australia has become a
police state / totalitarian society’ if shared on digital platforms would be regarded as
mis/dis/information. Like the alcoholic who if confronted by a partner, friend, counsellor etc. about
anger management problems arising from his drinking issues responds with violence to the
concerned person and continues on drinking. ACMA and the Government of the Day will become the
alcoholic, drunk with power to keep the household under control, or rather, “safe”. To preserve
democracy. Or the dangerous addiction. Depending on one’s perspective.

“The digital platforms will self-censor to avoid the big fines, and in the process, it is very likely that
the legitimate views of Australians will be shut down,” the Shadow Communications Minister Mr
Coleman said. For the record I am not a Liberal/National Party voter. The critical focus should be that
this will indeed occur. Call it dis-incentivization, fear of penalty, or effectively psychological ‘nudging’.

Lastly this Bill appears to operate according to the principles of discrimination by exempting the
Government media and major corporate media. What is the premise underpinning such exemption?
Would that be based on assumption? Or is it the case that the Government only ever expresses truth
via State media or corporate media channels? Always good while many citizens bad? That simple
binary narrative so often employed. To place a firm boundary, an iron curtain, a ‘Berlin Wall’ on
information, if you wish dividing accurate information and other inconvenient journalism, data,
information, peer reviewed published studies which in recent experience has been labelled
DISNFORMATION / MIS-INFORMATION.
