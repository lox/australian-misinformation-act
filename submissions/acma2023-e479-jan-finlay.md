opinions that we have here at present in Australia.
We all should have the right to freely express our thoughts but if this Bill is allowed to pass then the State will have the right
to charge us if we don’t agree with them. This will make us no better than the likes of Russia or China where people are not
allowed to disagree with any thing that the Government doesn’t want them to.
If the Government Media say something then we will not be allowed to disagree even if our conscience dictates otherwise.
In other words this is a very dangerous piece of legislation and will allow those in power to dictate and control our Australian
way of life which is so contrary to what Australia stands for.
It means we will be at mercy to whatever platform those in power stand for and that will end up making us all ‘toe the line’ to
whatever that particular governing group decide.
Please use your ‘common sense’ and don’t allow this Bill to pass. There are better ways to avoid people getting hurt by social
media and do you really think a Law like this will do anything but punish the majority of Australians.
Sincerely
Jan Finlay
