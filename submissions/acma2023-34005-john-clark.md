**tion) Bill 2023**

Dear Officer,

At root, there is no need for legislation like this. Stripping back the propaganda and carefully
chosen words, this draft is proposing to create a censorship state. Censorship of ideas being
shared amongst adults (whether they turn out to be true or false) is antithetical to a free and
open society/democracy. Worse, the censorship is targeted at specific groups and exempts others.
This is horrendous, from beginning to end.

Censorship is the hallmark of authoritarian and/or dictatorial and/or fascist regimes, not free
societies.

The principle of freedom of expression makes no distinction between truth and error, and this
is not a mistake. Rather it makes no distinction because, in an inherently and perpetually
complex and changing world, knowing with certainty which claims are true and which are false
is impossible or at least not discernible with certainty at the time.

The futility and counter-productive nature of this draft and other attempts at “narrative control”
and censorship are most clearly exposed concerning matters of a scientific nature.

I speak with some authority on this point as I am a practising Scientist and Engineer.

**ALL scientific claims are provisional. There are NO exceptions to this rule. All scientific**
claims are always and forever just one falsification away from oblivion. History is littered with
the consensus of well-intentioned, honest and genuine scientists who have had their consensus
subsequently falsified. And then if we include the consensus of less well-intentioned, less honest
and genuine scientists the tally of falsified consensus swells by orders of magnitude.

Another way of stating this is that, in science, absolutely certain facts do not exist. The
more recent the development, the less certain it is that the claim will remain unfalsified over
time.

The unavoidable consequence of this is that the task of accurately declaring a particular position
on a scientific question as misinformation or disinformation is itself, at best, uncertain.

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Therefore, any “authority” issuing a declaration that this or that claim is “misinformation” or
“disinformation” is itself potentially misinformation or disinformation.

And here we reach the point of circularity, which exposes the farce of the whole endeavour.

If any authority, such as ACMA, was vested with the powers proposed in the draft, the form of
claim they could honestly make must have the following specific components (taking particular
note of the disclaimer):

At this time, the consensus at ACMA is that claim X is misinformation, for the
following reasons:

(list of reasons)

Please note: this is an opinion based on consensus of a particular group of individuals
claiming expertise in the subject, and is itself not guaranteed to be correct.

Call me sceptical, but I don’t see any political or public authority being quite so energetic about
“countering misinformation or disinformation” when they would have to make their declarations
honestly, in the kind of form I just described above.

There is much more I could say, but time prevents me. However, I simply can’t end my
submission without mentioning the blanket exemption of the government, mainstream media
and official educational institutions from the scope of the Bill.

The brazenness of these exemptions is astounding.

The history of mainstream media claims is littered with lies.

The history of the government is littered with lies.

These institutions have a proven track record of lies, so on what planet do they deserve
exemption?

Does this amount to an admission that these institutions do lie regularly? Because if they didn’t
lie, then they wouldn’t need to be exempt from this Bill!

Yours sincerely,
