# Australian Press Council Submission – Proposed Communications Legislation
 Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

The Australian Press Council welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the consultations on the
Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

**The Australian Press Council**

The objects of the Press Council are to promote freedom of speech through responsible and
independent print and digital media, and adherence to high journalistic and editorial standards.

The Press Council is the principal body with responsibility for setting and promoting high
professional standards for publisher members and for considering, dealing with and responding to
complaints about Australian newspapers, magazines and associated and stand-alone digital outlets.
It seeks to meet its objectives by:

a) encouraging and supporting initiatives by the print and digital media to address the causes

for readers’ complaints and concerns;

b) keeping under review and, where appropriate, challenging political, legislative, commercial

or other developments which may adversely affect the dissemination of information of
public interest and may consequently threaten the public’s right to know;

c) making representations to Governments, public inquiries and other forums as appropriate

on matters concerning freedom of speech and access to information;

d) undertaking research and consultation on developments in public policy affecting freedom

of speech, and promoting public awareness of such issues; and

e) promoting an understanding of the objects and activities of the association especially among

editors, journalists and journalism schools.

The Press Council considers complaints about print and online publications. Where appropriate, it
seeks to achieve agreed remedies, issues letters of advice to publishers and publishes formal
adjudications regarding certain complaints.

The Press Council currently covers approximately 450 print and online mastheads. Constituent
bodies include most of the major newspapers and magazine publishers in Australia. The Press
Council’s role is not to represent the media, and constituent members of the Press Council may wish
to make their own submissions to the proposed Bill.

**Our Submission**

The Press Council supports the proposal that professional news content will not be within the scope
of the proposed Bill. Further, the Press Council welcomes the commitment in the guidance note that
the “Australian Government does not seek to influence the editorialisation and reporting by the free
press”. This is consistent with the Press Council’s “Charter for a Free Press in Australia”.

The Press Council’s submission focuses on areas which relate directly to our purpose and
responsibilities. These are:

1. The definition of “news content”;
2. The definition of “professional news content”; and


-----

3. Compliance with professional standards by organisations claiming to be covered by the

professional news content exclusion.

Definition of News Content

The Press Council is concerned that the definition of “news content” contained within the draft Bill is
too narrow and, as a result different material published by a news source that meets the criteria of
_professional news content may or may not be exempt. The Press Council believes this situation is_
potentially confusing to consumers, creates compliance issues for news sources and could create
enforcement difficulties for the regulator.

In support of this view, the Press Council notes that the Exposure Draft defines news content as
content that reports, investigates or explains any of the following:

(a) issues or events that are relevant in engaging persons in public debate and in informing

democratic decision-making;

(b) current issues or events of public significance for persons at a local, regional, national or

international level;

(c) current issues or events of interest to persons.

Whilst this definition of “news content” appears broad enough to capture the majority of material
published by Press Council members it is restrictive and it is foreseeable that some content published
by our members which would ordinarily be considered as ‘news’ would fall outside the proposed
definition of “news content”. For example, an opinion piece about a historical event would not fall
within the definition of ‘reporting’, ‘investigating’ or ‘explaining’ on a ‘current’ issue or event. A letter
to the editor expressing the opinion of a reader would not fall within the definition of ‘reporting’,
‘investigating’ or ‘explaining’.

The Press Council believes the simplest means of addressing this issue is by excluding from the Bill’s
coverage all material published by a news source that meets the requirements of professional news
_content._

Special exemption for user comments on news source owned platforms

The Press Council notes that the Fact Sheet distributed with the Exposure Draft indicates that
comment made in response to professional news content is not automatically excluded for
misinformation purposes. While the Press Council agrees with this approach in regard to user
comments made in response to professional news content on third party digital platforms, it does
not believe it is appropriate when applied to content published by a news source via its own
masthead, magazine, program, channel or website.

For a number of reasons, the Press Council believes that comments by users in response to
professional news content should be granted a special exemption so that the right balance is struck
between combatting misinformation and protecting freedom of expression.

Firstly, comments from users should be exempt because the comments are made in response to a
verifiable, accountable, and trustworthy source of information. Accordingly, any misguided user
comments would not be read by another user in isolation, but instead, in combination with the
professional news content which addresses the issue or event of discussion.


-----

Secondly, user comments are also made in a context that is uniquely conducive to constructive public
debate and discussion because they are monitored by a professional news source.

In order to preserve the perceived and real independence of professional media, news sources
should not be required to apply misinformation and disinformation criteria to user comments. News
sources should be granted full autonomy to moderate public discussion and debate.

Definition of Professional News Content

The Press Council welcomes the acknowledgement that adherence to the Press Council’s Standards
of Practice is a means of meeting the requirements to be excluded from the proposed powers under
the draft Bill. However, we note that the Exposure Draft attaches a further requirement that the
“news source” should have editorial independence from the subjects of the news source’s news
coverage.

The Press Council believes that this additional requirement is not only unnecessary but may interfere
with news reporting.

The issue of transparency around reporting is dealt with under the Press Council’s General Statement
of Principles and can be seen in operation in the way that news sources are to declare any conflicts at
the foot of news items.

If the current provision is retained, material reported by a news source for example about its own
shareholders Annual General Meeting or a news source reporting on issues which involve its staff or
senior managers e.g. industrial disputes, is not excluded from the proposed powers.

In addition, and further to the comments in the section regarding the definition of news content,
_news sources are responsible for the professional content that is published. The definition of_
_professional news content should reflect this. Therefore, the Press Council recommends 'produced'_
be replaced with 'published' in the definition of professional news content.

Lastly, with the inclusion of the recommended amendments, professional news content published by
a news source should be excluded from the application of the legislation if/when it is republished by
and/or on a digital service provider platform and/or service.

Compliance with professional standards by organisations claiming to be covered by the professional
news content exclusion.

The Press Council is concerned that while the Exposure Draft lists the means by which professional
news content can be excluded from the proposed powers there does not appear to be any means or
test around how a news source demonstrates compliance with the various rules attached to
professional news content.

The Press Council is aware of instances where organisations either pass themselves off as members
of the Press Council or claim to adhere to the Standards of the Press Council without being a
member.

The proposed legislation should direct the ACMA to ensure that claims by a news source that they
meet the requirements of professional news content are bona fide and that there is an independent
complaints-handling process in place to ensure compliance with standards. This is vital to the
integrity of the exclusion and the confidence consumers have in the integrity of news material being
reported to them.

Conclusion

The Press Council thanks the Government for the opportunity to make this submission and would be
pleased to expand on the points above by way of meetings, further consultations or submissions.
