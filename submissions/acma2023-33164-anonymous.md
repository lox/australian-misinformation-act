Our democracy was founded on the principles of free speech and free debate.

Australians should have the right to hear all the arguments         - the good ones and the bad ones         - and
decide for ourselves what's true and what's false.

Politicians and unelected bureaucrats have no place interfering in that process.

The so-called 'fact checkers' already get it wrong all the time. How much worse would the situation

be if ACMA were given an explicit mandate to control free speech?!

I urge you to STOP with this terrible idea.

A single body being charged and empowered with enforcing their own views as the 'truth' is nothing
short of being totalitarian and despotic. The proposal is dangerous, un-Australian and CANNOT be
allowed.

You know that democracy relies on free speech and open debate        - and that more free speech, NOT
censorship, is the best way to handle what you call 'misinformation'.

Australia already has a robust legal framework for dealing with dangerous lies or defamation. We do
not need censorship. Focus instead on educating the masses to consider using a range of sources of
information and to use their own discernment when deciding what is true or false TO THEM. Leave
conversation pathways open. Open and free sharing of information and perspectives is a basic

human right. Please, please do not reduce us to a communism country.

I ask you now to stand up for our democracy and reject the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I implore you to respect our democracy and commit yourself to this country's founding principles:
free speech and free debate.

Stop this authoritarian Bill in its tracks now.

August 2023
