###### Introduction

1. The ALA welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback to the Department of Infrastructure,

Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts as part of its consultation on

the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 ('Bill').

2. The ALA acknowledges that the intention underpinning the Bill is to equip the Australian

Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with specific powers and processes for

responding to the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation "on certain kinds of

digital platform services".2

3. We agree that online spaces should be safe and productive, and so the effects of

misinformation and disinformation being spread online must be addressed            - especially where

this poses a threat to public safety and Australia's democracy.

4. Equally, the ALA is concerned to ensure that human rights are honoured in the process of

enacting these reforms. This will be the focus of the ALA's submission, namely with regard to

freedom of speech considerations and the need to enact a federal Human Rights Act.

###### Freedom of speech considerations

5. The ALA notes significant commentary from the Federal Government, media and stakeholders

in relation to what impact the reforms outlined in the Bill might have on freedom of speech,3

including from the Honourable Michelle Rowland MP, Minister for Communications, who has

stated that the Bill "aims to strike the right balance between protection from harmful mis and

disinformation online and freedom of speech".4 The Bill itself only explicitly references

freedom of speech once, briefly noting the Commonwealth Parliament's intention for digital

platform services to be regulated in a manner that "has regard to freedom of expression".5

6. The ALA is a strong supporter of freedom of speech, also referred to as 'freedom of expression'

in international law (for example, in article 19 of the _International_ _Covenant_ _on_ _Civil_ _and_

_Political_ _Rights)_ and in this Bill (as above).

7. The High Court of Australia has affirmed that freedom of speech is one of the "fundamental

values protected by the common law".6 We believe it is fundamental in any society for

individuals to be able to discuss all matters fully and frankly.

8. Freedom of speech, however, carries with it special responsibilities. These responsibilities are

founded in the understanding that speech can be incredibly powerful and has the potential to

undermine other human rights if not reasonably constrained in certain limited circumstances.

a. One of these responsibilities relates to discrimination, in recognition that

discriminatory speech can have very serious consequences, both for the individuals

concerned and the broader community. Misinformation grounded in hatred is one of

many harms to be captured by the reforms outlined in this Bill to quash the spread of

misinformation online through action directed by the ACMA.7

b. **The** **ALA** **submits** **that** **the** **Federal** **Government** **must** **demonstrate** **that** **the** **resultant**

**limiting** **or** **abrogation** **of** **freedom** **of** **speech** **will** **lead** **directly** **to** **the** **prevention** **of**

9. In addition, the ALA is concerned about some extremely broad qualifiers and seemingly low

thresholds within the Bill's provisions for establishing whether shared content is

misinformation and/or disinformation. This has the potential to compromise freedom of

speech in the absence of constitutional and legislative human rights protections in Australia.

a. For example, one of the criteria for content being classified as misinformation and/or

disinformation for the purposes of activating the ACMA's proposed new powers is

that "the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive".8 The

ALA has not seen further guidance on these qualifiers in the legislation or in the

relevant external materials. These qualifiers are subjective and it is unclear how this

threshold is met                - for instance, who or how many people must have been misled or

deceived?

b. The ALA submits that guidance and clarification, as well as refinement of broad terms,

are essential with respect to all criteria, qualifiers and threshold terminology used in

the Bill, in order to ensure it is clear to digital service providers and to the general

public in what circumstances the ACMA's proposed new powers would be activated.

**of** **speech,** **as** **well** **as** **other** **internationally-recognised** **human** **rights,** **must** **be** **more** **closely**

###### The need to enact a federal Human Rights Act

11. In addition to freedom of speech, the ALA notes that the Department has also proactively

addressed other rights-related matters in the Bill and in supplementary materials, including

requirements for the ACMA to consider privacy interests and freedom of political

communication when developing any industry codes of conduct or misinformation/

disinformation standards.9

12. The ALA contends that it is currently inevitable that tensions will arise between

communications reform and many internationally-accepted human rights. In the continued

absence of a federal Human Rights Act, the ALA submits that those concerns will continue to

be raised           - and raised frequently           - about the impact on the public's rights that current and

future Commonwealth reforms (on this subject matter and more generally) may have.

13. This is especially so when there are criminal penalties applicable to individuals, as well as

corporations, being proposed             - as this Bill intends.10

14. **As** **such,** **the** **ALA** **reiterates** **our** **long-held** **position** **that** **the** **Federal** **Government** **should**

**legislate** **a** **federal** **Human** **Rights** **Act** **as** **a** **matter** **of** **priority.**

a. The ALA has made this recommendation for many years and in a variety of fora,

including to multiple inquiries conducted through the Commonwealth Parliament.

b. Most recently, the ALA has detailed the need for a federal Human Rights Act in our

June 2023 submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights'

ongoing _Inquiry_ _into_ _Australia's_ _Human_ _Rights_ _Framework.11_

15. The ALA considers that a federal Human Rights Act would ensure that those who wield power

within Australia's federal institutions are subject to a clear set of expectations concerning the

rights of people domiciled in Australia or under Australian jurisdiction and, further, that those

decisionmakers would be prevented from exercising power in such a way as to infringe upon

those rights.

16. A federal Human Rights Act could be a powerful tool not only in keeping society diverse, fair,

respectful and inclusive, but also being an essential adjunct to the institutions of

parliamentary democracy and the common law. Importantly, it would also give domestic

effect to Australia's international human rights obligations, including but not limited to

freedom of speech.

17. The ALA contends that a federal Human Rights Act would offer protection for the rights of the

Australian public (and in turn their trust that Federal Government reforms will not infringe on

those rights), while the Federal Government can continue to pursue accountability for digital

platform services regarding the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation.

###### Conclusion

19. The Australian Lawyers Alliance (ALA) welcomes the opportunity to have input on the

exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation

and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

20. The ALA is available to provide further assistance to the Department of Infrastructure,

Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts on the issues raised in this

submission.
