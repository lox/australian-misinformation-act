# SUBMISSION TO MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL

**_“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom_**
**_to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas_**
**_through any media and regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form_**
**_of art, or in any other media.”_**
Article 19, United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which Australia is a Signatory.

The statement above should cancel any attempt to bring in the proposed bill. Australians value the
right to say what we think without fear of consequences. Only communism restricts free speech.

Freedom of speech is a human right and the foundation upon which our democracy is built. Any
restrictions on these rights is a restriction upon democracy itself.

This bill seeks to overthrow the freedoms we have enjoyed as a nation and put us into a form of
slavery and control, and it seems to mirror the attempts of the World Economic Forum’s ‘Great
Reset’ to become the world’s slave masters.

Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only
one place to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a
source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear. (Harry S.
Truman, 33rd President of USA0

John F. Kennedy (35th President of USA) once said “A nation that is afraid to let its people judge
the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.” What is our
government afraid of? Intelligent people who challenge them?

The most recent examples of government silencing the so-called spreaders of ‘misinformation’ and
‘disinformation’ is during the recent Pandemic :

1. Those that spoke up about treatments available for the Covid virus were silenced and mocked.
2. The health authorities have now admitted that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin are actually

beneficial in the treatment of Covid. Many lives could have been saved if the doctors that
spoke out were not silenced.

3. The government told everyone the vaccines were safe and effective and those that questioned

this narrative were silenced and ridiculed. Now it is apparent that the vaccines were not safe
and effective as stated but have caused the death rate to spiral to over 20% since the vaccine
rollout. Why isn’t there an outcry about this? This is not normal.

4. Anyone who chose not to vaccinate against Covid-19 were ridiculed and shamed. Many lost

their jobs because they spoke out about their concerns.

This bill is one of the most dangerous attempts to destroy the freedoms that we have in Australia.

I hereby oppose, in the strongest possible terms, the introduction of this Bill. Instead I believe it is
time that we embed in our Constitution this very right similar to the First Amendment of the USA
Constitution.
