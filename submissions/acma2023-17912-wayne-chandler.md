Resident of, Australia

Having my say,

I hereby notify the Commonwealth Government of Australia that I, as a born in Australia Australian,
am in complete disagreement with the suggested new laws to provide the independent regulator,
the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat online
misinformation and disinformation. These suggested laws are a further slide into totalitarianism,
which has been some time coming within Australia, picking up pace in the last 3.5 years, and within
many jurisdictions across the realm.

I do not give my consent to these new laws to provide the independent regulator, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat online misinformation
and disinformation and formally call upon the Commonwealth Government of Australia to cease and
desist with progressing them in any way, shape or form either as currently proposed or at any time
in the future.
