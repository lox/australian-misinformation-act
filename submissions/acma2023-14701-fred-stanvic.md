# Comments on the draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

It is not the role of Government or a Government run Bureaucracy to be arbiter of
what constitutes Misinformation or Disinformation.

This bill (if passed) will result in an Orwellian style control of the Government/
Bureaucracy over its citizens, which will have the opposite effect on the spirit of a
free and educated people and it will stifle rational discussion and in many cases
opposing views.
Something that has only ever happened in totalitarian regimes such as the Nazi
Party, some Communist and some religion based regimes in the middle east.

There are many ways of looking at anything. Witness the current controversy
regarding Women's Sport. These matters must be allowed to be discussed without
the threat of Government fines and worse.

We need look no further than the disgraceful actions of Governments during the
CoVid saga.

Finally, I note that the bill expressly exempts the Government and its bureaucracy
from punitive action should the bill become law.
Quite a telling barometer of what the bill - if it becomes law - will ultimately become.

In closing If it has not become obvious I totally reject this Bill and urge you to NOT
proceed with it. Australia will become a worse place if it is passed.
