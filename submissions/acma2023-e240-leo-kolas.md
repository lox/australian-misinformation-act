Perhaps a note could accompany certain posts suggesting an alternative view or further information. I firmly oppose any method
beyond this.

To deem posts as factual or 'true' information is to assume a position of absolute certainty, a position that no one person or
organisation should hold. Ignoring subjective reality.

I believe that removing certain views from the most accessible mediums will simply push groups and ideologies further away.
This will not stop the spread of ideas deemed 'misinformation', if anything it will affirm the beliefs and create a stronger community
around them.
This trend has been seen time and time again over the last few years.

To maintain integrity It is essential to provide absolute transparency for all decisions made regarding misinformation, this should
include information on individuals who are calling the shots. If such a system is to exist it should be fully or partially controlled by
the general public as a democratic system.

Please consider that the system you create could and will be in the hands of people whom you fundamentally disagree with.
In this scenario would it serve you as an individual?

Kind regards,

Leo Kolas
