### Why limit ACMA s ability to censor opinions published on line only ?

In the exposure draft for the Bill, the Government argues that “Misinformation and disinformation pose a
threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy” but if so,
why is the legislation limited to just censoring opinions on-line ?

Surely if ‘misinformation & disinformation’ pose such a threat, that ACMA’s powers to censor should not be
limited to opinions only published online – and these powers should also extent to opinions published in
books. ‘Wrong-think’ must be stamped out whatever its source.

Firstly, as an example, take a book recently
published by Dr Pierre Kory, The War on
_Ivermectin._

Although Dr Kory was a front-line doctor that
cured sick patients firsthand using Ivermectin,
and his book details numerous peer-reviewed
studies and epidemiologic data demonstrating
the effectiveness of Ivermectin, “fact-checkers”
at Facebook and YouTube have deemed Dr
Kory’s opinions “misinformation” and censored
him and they must be right.

Afterall, if Ivermectin was admitted as an
effective Covid treatment the “safe & effective”
Covid experimental genetic vaccines would
never have been able to obtain their
Emergency Use Authorisation. And think how
much money that would have cost the vested
interests of Big Pharma. Hundreds of Billions
were at stake.

Therefore why should Dr Kory be able to side step Big Tech’s censorship and the Albanese’s governments
crack-down on things deemed ‘misinformation’ by writing a book ?

If the Government wants to shut down dissenting opinions it deems as “misinformation” – it must censor
opinions from all sources both online and print.

Secondly, what about someone that seeks to get around the
Government’s censorship regulations by standing on a soapbox to state opinions that contradict the official line from
Government, the WHO, the WEF and Big Pharma ?

We should they be allowed to engage in free speech, saying
things on a soap-box in the town square, if they would be
censored saying the same thing on-line ?

Surely this double-standard is unacceptable.

Just as this legislation proposes that we have government
agents spying on Australians’ social media posts, ready to
have them taken down if they are deemed “misinformation”
likewise we should also have government agents at public
rallies where similar conduct is likely to occur ready to take
down any speaker that contradicts the official line from
Government, the WHO, the WEF and Big Pharma.

**RECOMMENDATIONS: To protect democracy AMCA’s proposed new powers to censor any opinion**
published on-line that is deemed “misinformation” should also be extent if the same opinions are
published in books or at public rallies.

1. ACMA should be given the power to fine Book Publishers and Booksellers if they refuse to burn all

copies of any book that ACMA deems as containing “misinformation”.

2. ACMA be given the power to attend public rallies and take down any speaker they deem as making

statements containing “misinformation”. The taking down could be undertaken by a specially
trained squad of operatives dressed in black or brown with the words “Government Fact-checker”
clearly printed on the back of their shirts.

For what could possible go wrong if a Government Bureaucracy was given such power ?
