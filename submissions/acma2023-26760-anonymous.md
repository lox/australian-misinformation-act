Dear Sir/Madam

I am concerned at the proposed legislation, which presents a significant threat to free speech
and dialogue. The proposed bill gives excessive power to an unelected organisation to shut
down any "harmful" speech, which "harm" has been very loosely defined. This in effect
would give it the power to prevent dissenting voices and discussion surrounding sensitive
issues, which is a very healthy and necessary part of democracy. Furthermore, Governmentauthorised content would be exempt from this censorship. Surely, this would require the
Government to be infallible and unfailingly honest, which is a ludicrous proposition.

Also of great concern is that this censorship seems to hold no accountability or transparency.
It seeks to limit the powers and rights of citizens without giving them any recourse.

I note that important digital platforms already exercise great powers of censorship and this
bill would legitimise and empower them to continue to do so with impunity.

Please do the right thing. Instead of seeking to control citizens by controlling their access to
information, help us to grow as a society through encouraging the sharing of information and
beliefs and the practice of healthy discussion.

Yours sincerely

A concerned citizen
