This bill crosses a significant line when it comes to freedom of speech and does not
‘balance’ it. It is a form of coercion and manipulation of individuals by those in power.

Our culture has historically accepted the existence of differing opinions and ideas, and this
is a fundamental aspect of democratic society. This bill launches an assault on the
Australian right to democracy. It implicitly states that any view which contradicts the
narrative or opinion of the government is incorrect and should be policed. Dangerous
policing of free speech is already taking place within Australian society, and this bill will
only corral public discourse further.

This bill none-too-implicitly identifies the government as sole arbiter of truth, which is
completely unacceptable. Having a government body determine what is termed
‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ is not only unwarranted but completely dangerous.
Have we not learned lessons from communism or other regimes that utilise such tactics
involving the manipulation of public opinion through forcibly silencing those who do not
agree?

The new powers given to the ACMA could also entail invasive monitoring and recordkeeping of individuals who peaceably and respectfully dissent on certain topics, without
their consent. This could be used as a data-gathering strategy to try to predict a person’s
behaviour and hence ‘mark’ a person’s digital record in a way that is harmful, even if they
are merely respectfully disagreeing with majority or mainstream opinion.

I firmly reject this bill and consider it a dangerous step toward the silencing of Australian
free speech and the coercion of the Australian public.
