Submission: re Amendments to the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

I will only address one issue in this submission, namely who should be exempt from the Misinformation and
Disinformation Bill.

My recommendation is that no person or entity be specifically exempted from the scope of the Bill by virtue of the fact
that every person must have the right to freedom of speech. All people and entities must be allowed to share their
knowledge. Illegal activity and misinformed activity can be committed by anyone or any entity as will be demonstrated
below.

I will use one example to prove the point that an authority with a 'gov.au' website address was, and still is, arguably a
source of misinformation. The `misinformation' is the result of misleading statements in as much as large amounts of
relevant data has been omitted from public discourse by the Therapeutics Goods Authority (TGA).

The product that is swept up in this misinformation debacle is Pfizer's candidate drug 'Comirnaty' which was designed
to treat the virus SARS-cov-2. This product was approved by the TGA for release into the Australian community on 25
January 2021. This followed on from prior Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the USA granted by the Federal
Drug Administration (FDA) on 11 December 2020.

The Pfizer report referred to in this submission is `5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse
Event to 28-Feb-2021'). The segment of the report used is Appendix 1. The time frame for analysis is from
late 2022 up until now (August 2023) following the release of the Pfizer report.

I pose the question, why have NONE of the relevant authorities, institutions or corporations (TGA, ATAGI, Department
of Health and Aged Care, all teaching universities with medical departments, the AMA, AHPRA as well as all
mainstream media outlets) made an attempt to advise the public of the full listing of actual pathologies which Pfizer
noted in its report. To not do so is misleading by omission and corrupts any idea that informed consent happened.
Tens of millions of Australians have been affected by this oversight.

The Pfizer report was released to the public after a Freedom of Information request from a group of
health professionals (Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency) won their case against
the FDA in Court in late 2022.

Please review the following Appendix 1 from Pfizer and then compare it to what Australians were told
in regard to what side-effects an pathologies to expect after getting 'the jab'.

TGA: what Australians were told in regard to side-effects post 'the jab':

When the general publ ic dutifully attended clinics to get their `iab', they did so with a shopping list of about 8
side-effects, including headache, muscle and joint pain, fever, chills, nausea, chest pain, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. There was a number of adverse pathologies, including myocarditis, pericarditis, Bell's palsy,
anaphylaxis and stroke advised to the public.

How was this ever seen as a process of ful l `informed consent'?
### Comparing:_ some 1150 pathologies; TGA, some 5 pathologies.

This can only be described as a terminal case of under-reporting by the TGA of the number of Significant Adverse
Events (both adverse pathologies and their associated side-effects). The most recent report from the TGA
(ausD rnaty-230807.Ddf) still barely Days liD service to the full range of disease pathologies laid
out by in its EUA application to the FDA. There are more than 1150 pathologies caused by
Comirnaty in the report.

Summary
### If the TGA could not discern that it was Dropaaatinq misinformation (misleading by omission), how can
any other oerson or governmental entity or other entity ever be trusted? How is it, that not only did
the TGA manage to not notice the Pfizer report, but that also all medical authorities, the vast research
departments of Universities and mainstream media outlets also walked in darkness, apparently?

What is strange is that the DeoDle who did find the information were ostracized for their efforts -
de-olatformed, shadow-banned and attacked by mainstream media 'fact checkers', including the
world-famous fact checker 'Vice Vixen'.

How can it be argued that amendments to this Misinformation Bill be used to silence the general
Dublic, members or whom have proven they can sort fact from fiction, while all of the so-called 'trusted
authorities' could neither find nor understand simply research-related material?
### If Bureaucrats, select'exDerts' and leaacv media deserve exemDtion from the Bill so does everyone
else. All DeoDle must allowed the right to voice their concerns and share information. Exoerts and
'trusted authorities' asserting they have some special insights into science is little more than a hoax.

happen in the future, such data as released by Pfizer in its report must be passed on to the public.

Recommendation

My recommendation for this Misinformation and Disinformation Bill, including any new Amendments is
that: all government employees, all government authorities, all media, in particular mainstream
commercial media, must be included in the scope of the Bill if the general public is included.

There must be NO exemptions for any one group. Every one is exempt or no-one.

Freedom of speech is not a plaything for bureaucrats or vested interest to try and control.
#### It is not acceptable that one of the natural birthrights of a person, the right to freedom of speech, be
subject to restrictions due to some man-made legislation for ill-conceived amendments. Freedom of
speech is given by virtue of the reality that man is borne into this world free. No law or piece of
legislation can remove that right.

Thank you.
