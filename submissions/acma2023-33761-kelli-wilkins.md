In response to the ACMAâ€™s request for feedback on the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

I strongly oppose any form of censorship in Australia and do not support this legislation.

Freedom of speech needs to upheld for the rights of the people. It is a fundamental right of all
people everywhere to be able to share their opinion and have a say. Any laws which would empower
ACMA or any other Australian body to restrict in any way our right to communicate freely and openly
should be opposed at all costs.

Those who would enact this law are not only subjecting the people to communism and ending free
rights to citizens but entangling themselves in a web of destruction. It will not end well for anyone.

The choices we make now are critical to our future way of life and day to day enjoyment. Please
consider carefully before making any decisions about the laws governing our land of Australia. A law
of this magnitude should not be left up to a single committee or head of State to decide.

There are ways to combat real disinformation without having to enact a blanket law that will ensnare
the common people unwittingly. The law should always keep Government in check. They should
never have open slather to dish out propaganda at will whilst holding people to account to sharing
information. This Bill has many design flaws. It gives all the power to Government and none to the
people.

Good governance is always listening to the will of the people. Good governance stands for truth,
justice and honour. We hope that the people making these laws do not think they can rise above the
law or above the people. For what is done on earth will be seen in heaven. None can escape and
God will stand as Judge at the last day.

Thankyou for your time and consideration
