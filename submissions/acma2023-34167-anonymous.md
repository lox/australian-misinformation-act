This bill states the issue being "Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety
and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy".

This bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under
international human rights instruments like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I argue this bill is a direct threat to these
rights, the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and
economy.

The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship is hypocritical and
inconsistent and will establish an asymmetry that results in one rule for the government and
**another rule for Australians in what they can say. This bill puts too much power in the hands**
of unelected bureaucrats silencing speech in the public square without transparency or
**accountability.**

This bill puts the rights of personal privacy at risk by enforcing owners and users of digital
platforms to provide information to the ACMA which is a worrying breach of privacy.
