Re: The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

Dear Sir/Madam,

I trust this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed
bill to grant expanded powers to the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) for combatting online misinformation and disinformation. While the intention to
safeguard the public from misleading information is admirable, it is crucial to consider the
potential implications of such legislation on freedom of expression, open discourse, and the
role of government in regulating online content.

The proposed legislation is founded upon the premise of tackling misinformation and
disinformation that can be disseminated through digital platforms. However, we must
carefully balance the imperative to address harmful content with the preservation of
democratic values, including free speech and the exchange of diverse ideas.

**Freedom of Expression and Open Discourse: The cornerstone of any democratic society is**
the freedom to express opinions, even if they may be unpopular or contentious. Granting
the ACMA sweeping powers to regulate online content, even with good intentions, could
inadvertently stifle free expression. The potential for overreach or bias in determining what
constitutes "misinformation" is a real concern, as it might limit legitimate discussions and
dissenting viewpoints.

**Risk of Government Censorship: While an effective self-regulatory scheme is preferable, it**
is essential to acknowledge that expanding government powers can pave the way for undue
censorship. As the lines between misinformation and differing perspectives can sometimes
blur, placing the authority to decide solely in the hands of the ACMA might undermine the
public's trust and confidence in the digital space.

**Impact on Innovation and Competition: The proposed legislation might unintentionally**
create barriers for smaller platforms and start-ups to enter the digital marketplace due to
the potential burdens of compliance and penalties. This could hinder innovation and result
in an environment dominated by a handful of major players, limiting the diversity of content
and viewpoints available to the public.


-----

**Unintended Consequences: Overregulation could lead to an environment where online**
platforms, out of fear of potential penalties or legal action, become overly cautious and limit
discussions that are critical for societal progress. The fear of being labelled as
misinformation might cause platforms to err on the side of caution, silencing important
dialogues.

In light of these concerns, I urge you to consider alternative approaches that prioritize a
balanced solution. Encouraging media literacy, critical thinking, and responsible online
engagement are paramount in tackling misinformation. Rather than granting extensive
powers to the ACMA, we should explore measures that empower individuals to make
informed judgments about the content they encounter.

Promoting transparent reporting of how platforms address misinformation and
disinformation is commendable, but such efforts should not be contingent upon punitive
measures. Instead, a cooperative model involving the government, platforms, civil society,
and academia could lead to more effective solutions without sacrificing fundamental
principles.

I firmly believe that a thoughtful, balanced approach is required to safeguard freedom of
expression while combating harmful content. Let us strive to protect our democratic values
and foster open discourse in the digital age without compromising on the essential
principles that underpin our society.

As we discuss the crucial matter of combatting online misinformation and disinformation, I
would like to put forth a proposal that could serve as a complementary approach to address
these issues while upholding the values of transparency, accountability, and trust. This
proposal centres on the implementation of mandatory transparency measures for both the
government and the private sector.

**Background and Rationale:**

The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age has underscored
the need for a multifaceted approach that not only addresses content issues but also fosters
an environment of openness and credibility. The public's trust in institutions, both
governmental and corporate, is pivotal in combating misinformation. To that end, the
proposal I present seeks to enhance trust by mandating transparency in both sectors.

**Key Components of the Proposal:**

**Mandatory Disclosure of Government Actions: To promote openness, trust, and**
accountability, a new bill could be introduced that mandates government agencies to
provide detailed explanations for their actions and decisions. This would entail transparently
disclosing the rationale behind policy changes, legislative decisions, and the handling of
sensitive issues. A public repository could be established where citizens can access
comprehensive explanations, reducing the potential for speculation and conspiracy
theories.


-----

**Industry Accountability and Reporting: A vital aspect of combating misinformation is**
holding digital platforms and tech companies accountable for their content moderation and
data handling practices. A new legislation could require these companies to regularly
publish reports detailing their efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation. These
reports could encompass the measures taken, algorithms employed, and the outcomes of
their initiatives. Such transparency would empower users to make informed decisions about
the platforms they engage with.

**Collaborative Oversight and Verification: The proposed bill could establish an independent**
body comprising experts from diverse fields, including journalism, technology, and ethics.
This body would be responsible for overseeing the transparency measures, verifying the
accuracy of disclosed information, and reporting potential gaps or inconsistencies.
Collaborative oversight ensures a comprehensive approach that is not solely reliant on selfreporting.

**Benefits of the Proposed Approach:**

**Building Trust: Mandating transparency demonstrates a commitment to openness and**
accountability, helping to rebuild and strengthen the public's trust in both government
actions and corporate practices.

**Empowering Citizens: Access to comprehensive information enables citizens to form well-**
informed opinions, fostering a culture of critical thinking and reducing the susceptibility to
misinformation.

**Curbing Conspiracy Theories: By providing clear and accurate explanations for actions and**
decisions, the government can mitigate the spread of baseless conspiracy theories that
often arise from lack of information.

**Enhancing Corporate Responsibility: Requiring tech companies to transparently report their**
efforts to address misinformation not only encourages responsible behaviour but also
facilitates healthy competition within the industry.

The proposal I present advocates for the implementation of mandatory transparency
measures, drawing inspiration from history and scientific dissidents who challenged
prevailing norms.

**Learnings from History:**

In 1846, Ignaz Semmelweis challenged conventional wisdom by advocating for the simple
act of washing hands between patients. His tenacity in the face of resistance from the
medical community eventually led to a significant reduction in deaths due to puerperal
fever. Semmelweis's story teaches us the critical role that scientific dissidents play in
challenging established norms and uncovering vital truths that benefit society as a whole. It
also highlights how entrenched scientific frameworks can hinder progress, and how difficult
it is to overcome these barriers.

**Mandatory Transparency Measures:**


-----

Taking cues from the lessons of history and recognizing the need for transparency, I propose
that we implement mandatory transparency measures within both the government and
industry. This approach aligns with the core values of open discourse, accountability, and
the pursuit of truth.

**Mandatory Disclosure of Government Actions: Just as Semmelweis sought to unveil the**
truth behind the higher mortality rate in one clinic, it is essential that government actions
are subject to thorough scrutiny. A new bill could mandate government agencies to provide
transparent explanations for policy changes, legislative decisions, and actions that impact
the public. This would reduce the potential for conspiracy theories and foster trust in
governmental processes.

**Enhanced Industry Accountability: Like the role of scientific dissidents, mandatory**
transparency measures can hold digital platforms and companies accountable for their
practices. A requirement for these entities to publish comprehensive reports detailing their
efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation would empower users with factual
information. This transparency would also facilitate healthy competition, innovation, and
informed choices.

**Collaborative Oversight and Verification: Similar to the need for independent oversight in**
scientific progress, the proposed transparency measures could involve an independent body
of experts. This body would ensure that the disclosed information is accurate and unbiased,
preventing artificial consensus formation. Collaborative oversight safeguards the integrity of
the transparency process.

**Benefits of Mandatory Transparency:**

**Building Trust and Accountability: The proposed measures promote trust by creating an**
environment where the actions of both government and industry are open to public
scrutiny. Transparency fosters accountability and ensures that decisions are made with the
best interests of the public in mind.

**Empowering Citizens: Just as Semmelweis empowered individuals by reducing the risk of**
puerperal fever, mandatory transparency empowers citizens to make informed judgments.
Access to accurate information reduces susceptibility to misinformation and enables
responsible decision-making.

**Mitigating Artificial Consensus: Similar to how scientific dissidents challenge consensus**
formation, mandatory transparency measures prevent artificial consensus from shaping
public perception. This ensures that decisions are made based on evidence and reason
rather than external influences.

As we navigate the complexities of combating misinformation and disinformation, let us
reflect on the profound wisdom encapsulated in the adage that "as our island of knowledge
grows, so does the shoreline of our ignorance." This perspective serves as a reminder that
our understanding is ever-evolving, and we must remain humble in our pursuit of truth.


-----

Innovation, as history has shown, often emerges from the fringes rather than the centre. It
is on the edges of established knowledge that ground-breaking ideas germinate and
flourish, challenging prevailing norms and enriching our collective understanding. We must
appreciate that good ideas are not isolated from bad ones; rather, they are forged in the
crucible of debate and tested against the fiercest opposition.

The notion of consensus should be examined critically. We must recognize that consensus
can sometimes be artificial, manufactured, and influenced by factors beyond the pursuit of
truth. It is the duty of scientific dissidents to question consensus and shed light on
alternative perspectives that may have been sidelined due to their departure from
established norms.

Consider the case of John Snow and his pioneering work on the spread of cholera. In his
time, prevailing consensus held that miasma, or "bad air," was responsible for the disease's
transmission. Yet, Snow's relentless pursuit of truth led him to challenge this consensus and
propose that contaminated water was the actual culprit. His ideas, which would have been
deemed misinformation in the context of prevailing beliefs, eventually revolutionized our
understanding of disease transmission.

In our endeavour to combat misinformation, we must remember that knowledge flourishes
when diverse viewpoints are nurtured and explored. The history of scientific progress is
replete with stories of individuals who dared to question the status quo and confront the
unknown. Let us approach our current challenges with an open mind and a commitment to
transparency, knowing that the shoreline of our ignorance will forever be a frontier for
exploration.

I firmly believe that a thoughtful, balanced approach is required to safeguard freedom of
expression while combating harmful content. Let us strive to protect our democratic values
and foster open discourse in the digital age without compromising on the essential
principles that underpin our society.

I also firmly believe that the proposed bill for mandatory transparency can work in tandem
with efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation. By fostering a culture of
openness and accountability, we can reduce the fertile ground for falsehoods to take root. I
encourage you to consider the potential of this approach as we collectively work towards a
more informed and resilient society.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to contribute to the ongoing dialogue
on this critical issue.

Kind regards,

Teja
