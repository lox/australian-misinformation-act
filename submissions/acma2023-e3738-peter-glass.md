I write to express my very real concern with regard to the proposed Bill that has
### every potential for the government of the day to restrict free speech in something of
#### an Orwellian style overreach. We cannot allow any government to be the arbiter of
### truth in the day to day conversations that will play out in the community and raise awareness of potential harms. We have just witnessed the government censor the narrative during the covid-19 vaccination program where highly qualified doctors and virologists (amongst many others) were prevented from freely issuing warnings about the potential harms of the so-called vaccination program. We were told by both Liberal and Labor governments that the program would be both safe and effective, but it has now been demonstrated to be neither safe nor effective.
 Down through the centuries we have seen governing authorities, whether political or religious, censor and persecute any number of brilliant leaders in the community on the basis of what the government of the time considered (in error) to be truth - such censorship is the stuff of dictatorships anywhere the time of Socrates, Martin Luther, Galileo Galilei, Bertrand Russell, and all of the communist regimes of the 20th centur
#### y. We cannot allow government censorship to prevent society from determining truth
### through open discussion of any issue.

I implore a rethink on any attempt by the government to introduce this Bill to
### parliament. Regards, Peter Glass
