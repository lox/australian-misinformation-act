To whom it may concern:

Below is my submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

A few months ago I read the book 1984. The reading of this Bill
yesterday, gives me great pause to consider the significant
similarities with the theme of that book. I have to say I have very
serious concerns about this Bill and my recomendation is that it is
removed entirely.

Over the last three years we have seen Professional Media
organisations and Government Ministers and departments at both the
State and Federal level continuously provide information that in the
passage of time has proven to be entirely false and incorrect. This
Bill excludes the misinformation that these entities produce.
Over the same period we have seen independent, doctors, scientists,
journalists, and citizens who have provided truthful information
backed up by substantiated facts, have their voice silenced by
illegal and immoral actions by government departments and powerful
business interests. This Bill appears through its definitions and
structure, to be another avenue for government and powerful business
interests to silence those similar catergories silenced over the last
three years.

Open discussion from either end of the spectrum is what is required
to allow a democracy to function. One group may say one thing and
another group may say the opposite. It is up to each group to
present their facts and for the listeners to make up their mind where
the truth sits based on what is presented to them.
This Bill removes this tenant of a functioning democracy and may lead
down the path to a totalitarian state.

To make this Bill acheive the aim stated in its title, it should be
policing the entities that have their content excluded from control
by the Bill. These are the entities that have by far the largest
reach and provide the majority of information on a daily basis to
Australian residents. It should be esential that these entities
provide truthful information backed up by substantiated facts.
It should also be esential that the arbiter is not beholden to any of
these entities but is truely independent.

In summary, this Bill should be entirely rewritten to focus on the
information provided by the entities that are excluded and to provide
an independent Arbiter. If left in its current form without
addressing the concerns raised above, the Bill should be removed entirely.
