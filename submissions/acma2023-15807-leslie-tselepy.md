Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I do not agree with this Bill at all. It is there to purely silence us all, it is a disgraceful government that
tries to gag it's constituents. The government is voted in by the people for the people. As the last
few years have proven the government is proven to not be right and have made multiple
misinformation stuff ups. This bill should be scraped and the government be held accountable for
their misinformation and disinformation to.
