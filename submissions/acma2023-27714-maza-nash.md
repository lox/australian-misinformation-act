_“The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital platforms to_
_do more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful online misinformation and_
_disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech”._

My say on this subject is as follows:

This is government over-reach to which I object in the strongest terms.

Instead of serving the people Government has become a defacto master of their ‘serfs’.

This is another example of reducing everyday freedom. This new power would be abused by
government and deny the people they are supposed to be working for the right to Free Speech –
a corner stone of democracy.

Why should those there to serve us, the electorate, be able to decide what is misinformation,
and what is disinformation?

After the way the Australian government behaved during the pandemic I have no faith
whatsoever that this is a positive action and every confidence the powers would be abused.

I do not support this.
