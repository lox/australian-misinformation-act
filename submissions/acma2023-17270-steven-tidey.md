I am anti govt laws to regulate misinformation etc and am opposed to this draconian attempt to
quash free speech. Many have said this is the “…worst piece of legislation for free speech” and will
certainly have a "…chilling effect on very important debates”.
There is no way any government or government body should have such powers and Albanese’s
proposal to combat online misinformation MUST be STRONGLY OPPOSED as it’s a major threat to
freedom of speech and an unconscionable overreach of power into the lives of citizens.
How can we trust any government to define for us what misinformation or disinformation is? It’s
definition is laughable as recent years have shown to citizens the government itself engages in
information that is “false, misleading or deceptive; and… reasonably likely to cause or contribute to
serious harm”.
The proposed legislation is:

- the biggest imposition on free speech ever seen in a piece of legislation

- there are a range of inconsistencies and questions about the legislation, for example - no definition
of “serious harm,” despite it being the relevant trigger for action in the prohibition section.

- while the bill says it’ll target everything from blogs, podcasts Twitter posts etc, state and federal
governments would be exempted!!

- so governments can (and do) tell lies, spread misinformation that they call truth, but everyone else
could be banned from challenging it
