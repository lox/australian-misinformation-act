# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 I strongly object to the proposals in this government Bill.

 Who is to decide what constitutes 'misinformation' or 'disinformation'?

 Information, for instance, on Covid obtained from various digital platforms i.e. peer reviewed papers, people at the top of their professions across the medical field, globally, all their opinions referenced, have been charged with spreading misinformation by our Government, many vilified or losing their jobs, when it is quite clear that they tell the truth.

 Yet it is the Government that has shown itself to be the spreader of lies, misinformation and disinformation and withholding information over Covid:  the efficacy of the 'vaccinations', 'vaccination' harm, excess deaths, lockdowns, masks etc. It's a scandal of immense magnitude and in the light of available evidence, what the Government is thrusting on the Australian population, is criminal.

 An example. When  asked the Minister in Parliament to
 explain the reason for excess deaths, she said “I am advised . . .” and then gave an implausible explanation, encouraging the public to have further jabs to stop the spread in the community (when it is common knowledge that being vaccinated does not stop transmission, and, the greater number of jabs the more one's immune system is compromised). I have asked who advised the Minister but have not had a response.

 I am concerned about the continued push for further Covid 'vaccinations' by the Government despite the scientific evidence that shows that they should be stopped.

 I am also concerned about the growing power of the W.H.O., Health passports, the World Health Regulations and the re-set by the World Economic Forum, and thus it is essential that full knowledge is aired on the digital platforms on these topics (because of the loss of individual and sovereign rights) because Government and main stream media have demonstrated that they can no longer be trusted.
