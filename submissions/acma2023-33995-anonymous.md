Free speech is a necessity to allow a democracy to function. The dishonest and intentionally harmful
act of spreading disinformation falls under the category of fraud, for which legislation already exists.
The power to restrict speech opens the doors for directing public opinion as has happened in other
countries in the 20[th] century, leading to oppression, corruption and the misuse of power.
