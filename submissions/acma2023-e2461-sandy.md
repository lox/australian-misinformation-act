###### Submission re New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation August 2023

 Thank you for the opportunity to put in a submission re the new censorship laws being considered

 I TOTALLY object to this bill - Communications. Legislation Amendrrnt (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) F it 2023.

 Here is -:1 whole host of examples & cc:;.nme -a o;,, why is is an unnecessary is ; .

 Especially as the fact is "that th bill explicitly exempts ally government communication, of any level of government, from being considered misinformation or disinformation". So the Government is not bound by the same laws as it's peasants? H:jw is that trust building? How is that democratic? How dare you insult us like this!! We are not young children needing to be protected from the childhood illusions of Father Christmas & the Tooth Fairy. YOU are trying to hide from us things that directly affect our rights in a supposed democracy, our bodily autonomy, the way we live/used to live in a country like Australia and also maybe hide poor governs jce.

 This is nothing more than a TRAMPLING ON OUR RIGHTS.

 Are YOU are selling us out to Corporations, WEF, WTF, UN, WHO, etc and YOU don't want the truth to be exposed?

 A wise man called Plato said:

 "You should not honor men more than truth. "

 So how wise are you in wanting to stop mis/disinformation v%°rich is actually stopping free speech & diaic,ue about important issues & the truth.

 And from another wise man of science:

 "He who does not know the truth is only a fool. But he who knows it and calls it a lie is a criminal. " —Galileo Galilei

 "On this day, June 22nd, we mark the 390th anniversary of a pivotal moment in the history of scientific discovery. It was on this day in 1633 that Galileo Galilei, the pioneering Italian astronomer, was forced to recant his advocacy for the Copernican system by the Roman Inquisition. This system, positing the Sun at the center of the universe, fundamentally challenged the long-standing geocentric model favored by the Church, which placed Earth at the universe's center.


-----

###### His books were banned, his movements were restricted, and he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest, deprived of the liberty to share his groundbreaking findings with the world. Ironically, the passing of time has not only vindicated Galileo but also elevated him to the status of one of the most influential figures in scientific history.

 Galileo's forced recantation, carried out under threat of torture, serves as a sobering reminder of how individuals can be silenced, censored, and persecuted for daring to challenge mainstream narratives or popularly held beliefs. Despite the weight of empirical evidence supporting his views, Galileo was punished for the perceived heresy of his astronomical discoveries, highlighting the oppressive power dynamics that can stifle scientific progress and individual freedom of thought.

 However, the broader historical narrative underscores an inescapable truth: scientific understanding is perpetually evolving. The passing of time has vindicated Galileo's beliefs, with his propositions about our solar system now universally accepted. It underscores the critical importance of fostering a societal environment that encourages and values open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, and the free exchange of ideas. Society must resist the reflexive impulse to suppress voices that question established notions, for it is through such inquiry that progress is made.

 Today, we remember Galileo not only for his extraordinary contributions to astronomy but also as a symbol of intellectual courage and integrity. His example inspires us to remain open to new ideas and committed to the pursuit of truth, no matter the obstacles. As we honor his legacy, we also acknowledge the vital need for a society that cherishes intellectual freedom, protects those who challenge existing paradigms, and understands that science, in its very essence, is an ever-evolving exploration of our universe."

 So now are all dissenters ,e going to -rd up like Galileo, or worse?

 This year is 120th birthday of George Orwell — what a fine way to honour the man — to make his fiction, a reality, and gift your ignorant peasants with such demonic & suffocating legislation. How stupid do you really think we are? Especially after all the lies & deceit around CoVid & the CoVid "vaccines"? Especially as all-cause mortality is WAY up yet the Government & Public Health officials are doing NOTHING to find out the causes of so many "sudden deaths" of "cause unknown".

 How ridiculously gullible do you think we are that we believe this legislation is for our benefit? WE are not little kids that need a Government acting in loco parentus for us.

###### Misinformation is false information that is accidentally false. Disinformation basically is deliberately false information and harmful — HEY guess which one is used on us by our Governments (Federal, State & to a lesser extent, our Local Governments) a lot of the time??

 Free speech is in the US Constitution and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted in 1948 and Australia was one of the countries to draft it. "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek to receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of Frontiers (What's the point of these things that Australia signs & then does nothing about eg Nuremberg Code — look how well that was adhered to in the last 3-4 years).

 Is this to soften the blow for us, and the backlash for you, of the WHO Treaty & CA+ and the WEF agendas that our Governments are welcoming into our country?

 Governments can flex the "truth" to suit their aims & there is NO recourse available to the citizens. How is that possible in a supposed democracy?

 There is NO benefit to the public to go down this path. The benefit is totally to the Government & one must wonder why they feel they need to cover their tracks with such blatant control.

 My point is: Will this ensure our Governments tell us the truth? If not, then what's the point?

 ALL this would be unnecessary if our Governments had credibility — if they were open & transparent & informed the citizens truthfully. We ALL know this is to silence dissent against the Government/s & is NOT for our benefit & protection. It's to protect the ones who hold the power, from revealing the truth about how they run the country, the slip ups they make, the double speak & actions ie saying one thing and then when they think they are not being watched (like a naughty child) they then do the opposite, as well as hiding personal atrocities that WILL come to light one day in one way or another.

 Having a cut down on mis/disinformation does NOT make the Government more transparent or HONEST OR responsible for telling the TRUTH. And that is the bottom line of what people want. We are sick of being lied to by the authorities. The last 3-4 years has been one lie after another after another — and much of this is coming to light both here in Australia with the TGA as well as our Public "Health" officials.

 Is the aim of these games is to keep people ignorant — blissfully unaware of their rights? Blissfully unaware of the truth and true purpose of their existence? Blissfully unaware so they can be manipulated by fear & misinformation from authoritative figures?

###### I'm also wondering if this submission process is to put on your radar, those who show some opposition to some Government narrative so we can be put on a Government watchlist to be closely surveilled? Excuse my scepticism but .... What else can we deduce for such an untrustworthy piece of legislation?

 Surely by now, most Australians are awake to the amount of Government double speak that is occurring. And understand whose definition of mis/disinformation will be used as the benchmark for what is accepted or not.

 After the last 3-4 years WHY would ANYONE trust what the Government & its authorities when they say something is true/real/honest? Who are the real dis/misinformation spreaders?

 Our Government is controlled by the two major parties & we all know how often they don't see eye to eye, so who's view is going to be released to the public as mis/disinformation?

 Democracy (and science AND medicine) means discussing various points of view. True science means questioning — constant questioning — otherwise it is simply NOT science. How far would we have come from early medicine if questions were not allowed to be asked & hypothesis explored? "NO questions are allowed yet they call that science. The process of science is supposed to be a process of never ending questions." Without vigorous questioning it simply IS NOT science. Science is to question both sides, & question, hypothesize, & question again & have a healthy rigorous debate.

 If the Government really wanted the truth why are Public Health officials NOT exploring the rise in all-cause mortality which is at historically high levels? A 10% increase eg from war, is a once in a generation occurrence yet a current rate in Australia of 16-20% seems acceptable today. Who is providing the mis/disinformation on this grave concern (pun intended)? Surely this IS one of the PRIME concerns of a Public Heath Department — to find out what is killing its citizens, with "cause unknown", in such large numbers. Before CoVid, excess death

— for no apparent reason, in historically large numbers, would have been explored
###### and researched without hesitation. Deaths from CoVid were scrolling continuously across our screens for months, if not years, but there's not a peep about these people dying now. (PS, for Government officials, if there is a true pandemic, people don't need to see numbers on the screen, or minute by minute 24/7 reminders there is a pandemic, they KNOW it is happening cos it affects their circles of friends & family).

 Are the Public aware that authorities eg WHO & many others change definitions so that people are misled by mis/disinformation FROM AUTHORITIES eg the change in the term `pandemic' and in the definition of `vaccine'?


-----

###### Fact checkers — were anybody who could write an opposition piece and often came from organizations funded by — well, you know who. How can these average Jo/Joe's tell people who are esteemed in their profession for decades & have made life changing scientific discoveries, that they are not correct? Who in their right mind would listen to these blatant spreaders of mis/disinformation? Yet they were not penalized, censored or taken down from media & social media platforms. They were usually totally unqualified opinionated authors of junk science & junk theory who did nothing to find the real truth. BUT they were NOT categorized as mis-disinformation spreaders. Whose criteria decided that the "fact checker" nonsense could be spread but NOT distinguished leading scientists & doctors in many fields?

 Why hasn't Julian Assange been released, like Albanese said he would do? What's the truth about that? For a fact, CoVid & the ensuing and continuing onslaught on our rights and freedoms would NEVER have got off the ground so rapidly had a person with the ability to disseminate the truth & expose the lies be free. Assange will never be freed while the authorities need a lid on all the lies/untruths/deceit that they are portraying as truth.

 Our TGA (a private off-shore company??) did not release the truth about the effect of CoVid "vaccines" on Australians that was occurring very early on cos "it may affect vaccine hesitancy". How can we trust these authorities if they are allowed to hide the truth & thereby enable mis/disinformation to occur? If the people/groups are going to be bound by this legislation, then why not our Government & other authorities?

 The Government has all the facts on the effects of the CoVid shots — through All Cause Mortality figures & the exploding MediBank rebates that would be occurring from people seeking medical advice/help after vaccination, for side effects they experienced. We were locked down in the beginning to "flatten the curve" but there's been NO attempt to flatten the curve of decimation & damage that has occurred after the vaccine roll out (& yes, association is not causation but we have conditions occurring that have NEVER been seen before & conditions exploding, like infertility & cancers — all since 2021 AND NOT in the year of the supposed pandemic). So what TRUTH will come to light about that?

 What's the truth on climate cooling (70s), to global warming (2000's) to now "climate change"? IS it cos the elites are messing with our weather big time & have been for decades and decades. How can you mess with the weather, causing it to change and THEN claim the weather is changing? THEN blame it on the little guy cos he drives a car & eats meat? MILLIONS of tons of plastic, aluminium, titanium, strontium, barium etc is being put into skies over the world EVERY YEAR, but the big Corporations aren't blamed, the big polluters aren't blamed, the geo-engineering companies aren't blamed, Governments & their environmental agencies that allow it


-----

###### (or turn a totally blind eye to it) aren't blamed. I am cos I don't walk everywhere & want grow my own food. What's your mis/disinformation on that truth?

 You don't poke a hornet's nest for decades THEN blame them when things go pear- shaped.

 The weather manipulation & the dumping of pollutants & heavy metals into our (global) skies affects EVERY ecosystem on this planet, EVERY life supporting system there is, YET all the environmental crises are blamed on the average person just trying to keep their head above water.

 Mis/disinformation implies that what we will be fed will be the truth BUT there is NO legislation that says our Government has to provide its citizens with the truth. So what will the advantage be to the public if the Government & other authorities (WHO, WEF, UN, etc) can provide mis/disinformation to us BUT portray it as `truth' yet not get caught out themselves? Is this propaganda?

 What about the highly sexualized, grooming "curriculum" that has been introduced by WHO & UN to schools in Europe & Ireland? Is this "curriculum" - that last year would have been called blatant pornography — going to be released into our schools? What's the truth on that one?

 Hidden agendas, subtle and blatant lies, innuendo, skirting around the truth, distorted facts, being deliberately misleading, blatant liars being let off the hook (eg Hunter Biden, Anthony Fauci, UN Peace Keeping Forces, and some of our politicians, etc) — WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

 It's the MSM & Government mis/disinformation we want protection from — not a few opinionated people who release information that anyone can research & find out if it fits their truth. Why does the Government find these people such a threat? If the Government were telling us the truth, people wouldn't bother to look elsewhere.

 We want truth, integrity, honesty, sound morals & ethics from our leaders. So I am AGAINST your mis/disinformation Bill cos it will just perpetuate the deceit & lies from the authorities we put into power to protect us and to do what's right by our country. NOT some party that will lie blatantly to our faces & then sell us out to the WEF & WHO & UN, all the while claiming they are telling us the truth & that they have protected us from mis/disinformation — what bollocks.

 It's like in a cult, "everything was rolled out, & the public accepted that you cannot go against the guidelines (guidelines became like the precepts of a cult) where you get those guidelines & precepts from a tiny few people who hold sway over the public mind and if you raise your hand to question those edicts, what happens to you? If you are in a free society that is genuinely oriented towards discovering what the truth is, then raising your hand is welcomed. If you are actually following the true scientific method which is just about observing a phenomenon and making


-----

###### theories & finding evidence and trying to look for the truth, it's a process of trying to gauge what the truth is, right?, then we would have seen more public scientific debates, we would have seen Anthony Fauci debating RFK Jnr, we wouldn't have seen the censorship happening, if we remember we didn't have the fact checkers til the whole lockdown thing started & they came in to say this is what you should be thinking about, this is the guidelines you need to follow and anything against that they would call you a conspiracy theorist, and even got to the point in some countries they were branded domestic terrorists, for daring to challenge the regime with their mandates & heavy handed lock downs."

 "Political cults, how political tyrants are expert at essentially turning the entire population of a country or a nation into a cult, that redeems anybody who rebels or dissents against it as being a threat to everybody else and then treats them like that, that's where you get your gulags, concentration camps, turning vaxxed against unvaxxed" (Vax 101 — if you are vaxxed, it shouldn't matter if others are not, cos they should be protected) "and it eventually turns into mass starvation & genocide, then total tyranny & loss of freedom

 That's what a cult does, NOT a group trying to find the real & actual truth."

 A cult uses silence, coercion, name calling, cancelling instead of debate, questioning, discussion. Hmmm sounds familiar.

 What happened to The Voice of those who opposed mandates & use of experimental jabs (that DIDN'T match the definition of the time, for vaccine). What about the average person who wants a VOICE?

 What about `malinformation' — information with malicious intent — information that maybe completely true but powers that be deem this true information malicious

###### It has nothing to do with truth/untruth — it's all about opinions - & opinions can change

 There has always been a statement that child pornography, violence, sexual violence, murders & rapes even of children, cannot be taken off the internet as there is no way to do it YET they very quickly found ways to censor & track CoVid information that was against Big Pharma & Government narrative — so don't tell me that's not mis/disinformation.

 "If these powers were in place in 2002, when the US, UK and Australian governments lied about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, they could have been used to suppress public opposition to invasion and war."

 I can see clearly now why NOTHING has been done to free Julian Assange. Was it all just Albanese hot air to claim Albanese would free him if he got into power? YOU do not want him free because you do not want someone of his integrity spreading REAL truth about all the lies that have been told, the mountains of lies, the tsunamis of lies, the enormity of the lying that we have been told and will continue to be told in this mass removal of our human rights.

 It's all smoke & mirrors to further enslave the people of this wonderful land.

 IF what is put on social/digital media is mis/disinformation, then SIMPLY REFUTE IT WITH FACTS. NOONE will debate RFK Jnr because he KNOWS his facts. NOONE will debate with the others supposed spreaders of dis/misinformation because they have the FACTS — the TRUTH. Just saying someone is lying by a pathetic equivalent of a 5t" grader 'fact checker' or smearing someone's name, even distinguished doctors & scientist of decades of brilliant work that has advanced our societies, is truly INDICATIVE that what they are saying is TRUE because you can't argue against it. BECAUSE THERE IS NO ARGUMENT, let's just label it mis/disinformation.

 These tactics are nothing more than a 5-year old would use in the playground. They are NOT the tactics of wise men & women of REASON & WISDOM. So take your

 "Thinkers have struggled with the implications of free speech for centuries, and concluded that limiting speech is far more dangerous to society than the regrettable consequences of false claims.

 That's why free speech is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution: "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press"."

 And it is why it is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia helped to draft in 1948: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

 "Social media is a double-edged sword: it can be a channel for the worst misinformation and disinformation, but so can governments, as we have recently witnessed" with CoVid and currently are witnessing with The Voice saga, pretending it's a yes vote to be nice & bring about Reconciliation when it WAY more than that; "alternatively, it can also be the medium that exposes government and corporate lies that the corporate mainstream media won't, which restores power to the people."

 When good science is suppressed by the medical-political complex, people die

`A But then is that the agenda anyway? —` be truthful now, no mis/disinformation here

 Something has to be done to "keep the bastards honest" cos believe me the bastards are so far off the honesty scale its staggering.

 In a supposed democracy this sort of Bill is unwarranted and counter intuitive. IT IS NOT NEEDED. What we DO NEED is a Bill that causes the Government to be honest to its people cos that's where the real rot lies.
