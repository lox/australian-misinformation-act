SUBMISSION

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023

Please allow me to preface this submission with the foundation of a Biblical perspective.
Jesus states in John 14:6, "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me."
This means that Jesus is not only the arbiter of truth, He is truth itself.

Firstly, I would like to address the point included in the Communications Legislation
Amendment Bill that "misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society, and economy." Can I
respectfully suggest that state-imposed (subjective) truth poses a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy. Australia's
democracy and society has been built on the principles found in the Bible, which is the
source of objective truth (see Jesus's statement earlier in the book of John).

Secondly, the proposed Bill stands in directly Opposition to both Australian and
international human rights. For example, this statement from the Australian Human Rights
Commission- "There is a real risk that efforts to combat online misinformation and
disinformation by foreign-actors could be used to legitimise attempts to restrict public
debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce ideological conformity in Australia."

Additionally, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "Everyone has
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers." (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-
of-human-rights)

Lastly, the terms defined in the Bill are much too broad, vague and general in nature to be
beneficial, and instead could very easily be manipulated by those with ulterior motives. For
example, misinformation is defined in the Bill as "content disseminated using a digital
service that is false, misleading or deceptive..." The threat is described as aimed at "...our
democracy, society and economy." These terms are extremely wide-ranging and ambiguous
in nature, making it easy prey for those who wish to exercise excessive power or control
over the Australian people. A respectful reminder that we are a democracy, not an oligarchy
or dictatorship.

Thank you for your time! Can I challenge you to consider your eternal destiny? Death could
come at any time, and how much better to meet God as our Creator and Saviour, than your
Creator and Judge. John 3:16 states, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

Yours sincerely,

Isabella Caines
