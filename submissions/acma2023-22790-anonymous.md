# Communications Legislation Amendment
 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

**Response to the abovementioned proposed legislation:**

This response focuses on some broad, but important, concerns which arise from the content of the
proposed legislation.

**Key Concerns**

_Misinformation and Disinformation:_

- These terms are very broadly defined.

- How is ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ to be identified and interpreted accurately, especially if

AI is used to apply misinformation/disinformation codes?

- How will the truth be determined? Apart from philosophical discussions of what the truth may be,

most dictionaries define truth to be: “verified or indisputable fact, proposition, principle, or the like”
and “adherence to reality.” Truth typically arises through discussion, consideration of multiple
unbiased perspectives, and objective analysis of the facts and reliable data. How is this to be achieved
when the gatekeepers are big tech and a government regulator?

_Administration, Regulation, Enforcement:_

- It appears that the power to administer, regulate and enforce this new law will be concentrated in a

government agency (Australian Communications & Media Authority) with the help of big tech (under
threat of severe punitive measures).

- How will the technology companies and ACMA be accountable (in regard to their activities related to

the proposed legislation) to the people of Australia—such as through audit, review, enquiry, and the
like; who will conduct such audits, and how will audit independence be achieved?

- What avenues do the people of Australia have to challenge or dispute what is deemed

‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation?’

**Discussion**

One definition describes Democracy as: “a system of government in which laws, policies, leadership, and
_major undertakings of a state or other polity are directly or indirectly decided by the ‘people’;” and_
“democracy helps people to protect their fundamental interests, […] guarantees its citizens fundamental
_rights […] and ensures its citizens a broader range of personal freedoms than other forms of government_
_do;” and furthermore, “only democracy provides people with a maximum opportunity to take moral_
_responsibility for their choices and decisions about government policies.”[1]_

The proposed legislation appears to go against the grain of what Democracy is all about. While the
expressed intent is to “keep Australians safe,” the proposed law ignores that the Australian people are
capable of critical thinking and making choices accordingly. Instead, implementation of controls are
proposed that are more in line with Authoritarianism.

There is, arguably, a slight difference between Authoritarianism and Totalitarianism. Authoritarianism in
politics and government is defined as “the blind submission to authority and the repression of individual
_freedom of thought and action,”[2]_ and Totalitarianism is defined as a “form of government that

_theoretically permits no individual freedom and that seeks to subordinate all aspects of individual life to_
_the authority of the state;” however, “both of these forms of government discourage individual freedom_
_of thought and action.”[3]_

Given that the proposed legislation will bestow power upon a government regulator and big tech
companies to enforce control over what is deemed ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation,’ it is suggested
that these proposed measures are well aligned with those employed by authoritarian or totalitarian
regimes of the past. It is well documented that Stalin, Hitler, and Mao for example, controlled information
and free speech. The Bill appears to be proposing legislation that will enable the government to control,
or considerably limit, freedom of speech with the help of a technocracy. Such a partnership is likely to
creep into abject censorship which is, in effect, a form of thought-control.

**Conclusion**

In the light of the above discussion, it may be pertinent to highlight a recent lawsuit where a Judge limited
the Biden administration from working with social media companies to control the narrative. To quote:

_A judge […] prohibited several federal agencies and officials of the Biden administration_
_from working with social media companies about “protected speech.” […]_

_U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty of Louisiana granted the injunction in response to a_
_2022 lawsuit brought by attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri. Their lawsuit_
_alleged that the federal government overstepped in its efforts to convince social media_
_companies to address postings that could result in vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19_
_pandemic or affect elections._

_Doughty cited “substantial evidence” of a far-reaching censorship campaign. He wrote_
_that the “evidence produced thus far depicts an almost dystopian scenario. During the_
_COVID-19 pandemic, a period perhaps best characterized by widespread doubt and_
_uncertainty, the United States Government seems to have assumed a role similar to an_
_Orwellian ‘Ministry of Truth’.” […]_

_“The evidence in our case is shocking and offensive with senior federal officials deciding_
_that they could dictate what Americans can and cannot say on Facebook, Twitter,_
_YouTube, and other platforms about COVID-19, elections, criticism of the government,_
_and more,” Landry said in a statement.[4]_

It is requested that these concerns, comments and reflections are taken into consideration in further
discussions and amendments of this draft legislation. It is also suggested that this proposed legislation is
unnecessary and should be dropped in its entirety.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
