## Our democracy was founded on the principles of free speech and free debate.

Australians should have the right to hear all the arguments        - the good ones and the bad
ones       - and decide for ourselves what’s true and what’s false.

Politicians and unelected bureaucrats have no place interfering in that process.

The so-called ‘fact checkers’ already get it wrong all the time. How much worse would
the situation be if a ‘Ministry of Truth’ were given an explicit mandate to control free
speech?

I urge you to consider the full consequences of this terrible idea.

You know that politicians enforcing their own views as the state-held ‘truth’ is nothing
## short of being totalitarian and despotic. It’s un-Australian and cannot be allowed.

You know that democracy relies on free speech and open debate      - and that more free
speech, not censorship, is the best way to handle what you call ‘misinformation’.

Australia already has a robust legal framework for dealing with dangerous lies or
defamation. We do not need special laws for politicians.

I ask you now to stand up for our democracy and reject the proposed ‘Ministry of Truth’.

I implore you to respect our democracy and commit yourself to this country’s founding
principles: free speech and free debate.

Stop this authoritarian ‘Ministry of Truth’ in its tracks now.

Yours faithfully,
