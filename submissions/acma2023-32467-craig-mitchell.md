Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 currently under
consideration. As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe that this bill is a direct attack on our
freedom of speech and an infringement on the democratic values that our nation holds dear.

First and foremost, this bill creates a stark division among citizens, categorizing them into two
groups with differing levels of freedom of expression. The first group consists of politicians,
journalists, and members of educational institutions who will have the power to share information whether true or false - without repercussions. The second group comprises ordinary citizens whose
voices are often more knowledgeable on specific topics than those in the first group, such as
industry insiders. This unfair division undermines the power of the internet, which has been a vital
democratic tool, giving a voice to regular people.

Furthermore, the excessive fines imposed by this bill will result in digital services becoming overly
restrictive in terms of speech, far beyond what is currently deemed acceptable. The absence of any
"pressure escape valves" creates a system that is inherently harsh and leaves no room for dialogue
and debate. It is impossible to accurately determine what is true or false, as new information
constantly emerges, challenging previously accepted facts. The bill's broad definitions of


-----

misinformation and disinformation jeopardize the freedom of speech and hinder open and honest
discussions necessary for finding common ground.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious
concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His statement on social media highlights the
challenges of implementing such legislation and the potential for fines to be levied on information
that may later be proven to be true.

The proposed bill also raises significant concerns about industry bodies and their ability to influence
regulations and create codes that favor larger digital services at the expense of smaller competitors.
This anti-competitive behavior undermines the principles of fair market competition and stifles
innovation.

Moreover, the extraterritorial application of this bill and its impact on foreign entities is highly
problematic. It places an undue burden on digital platforms and services worldwide without regard
for their compliance with Australian law or membership in relevant industry bodies. This overreach
threatens to isolate Australia from the global internet community.

Additionally, the bill's infringement on the implied constitutional freedom of political communication
raises constitutional concerns. Limiting legitimate discussions on matters of public policy, scientific
investigation, and debate would unduly curtail this freedom. The government's assumption that it
can determine what is true without considering the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary
Australians diminishes the diversity of perspectives essential for informed decision-making.

Furthermore, the threats posed to digital platform providers and ordinary citizens under this bill are
deeply concerning. These threats range from reputational damage and financial penalties for
platform providers to the imposition of reporting requirements and potential legal action against
everyday users. This style of governance is reminiscent of oppressive regimes and undermines the
principles of mateship and diversity that Australia holds dear.

It is also worth noting that the enactment of the News Media Bargaining Code in its current form
limits digital services' capacity to address misinformation and disinformation effectively. This bill
reinforces the need for diverse perspectives, including independent media organizations, journalists,
and bloggers, to counter false information. Disempowering these entities and consolidating power in
the hands of government-approved sources further endangers public access to vital information.

As an Australian citizen, I urge you to reconsider the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This bill directly undermines the
fundamental freedoms and democratic principles that our nation upholds. I implore the Department


-----

of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts to listen to the
voices of ordinary Australians and reject this dangerous legislation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will act in the best interests of our
democracy and the freedom of speech we hold dear.

Yours sincerely,

Craig Mitchell
