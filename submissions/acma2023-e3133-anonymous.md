Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a
violation of Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how
unelected bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them. We
have already seen this happen in the U.S. and don't want it here.

Please reject this bill.
