I am a y old Australian citizen. Born to an English father and Australian mother. I have lived in this country all my life.
I have lived in a country where its citizens have been granted and enjoyed the ‘freedom’ to express their ‘opinions and
views’ on ‘policy’ proposed by successive governments and the opportunity to influence ‘policy decisions’ before they
passed into law. Governments, rightly, should ‘consult’ with the people they represent through due process, proper
**consultation and debate. This is how the ‘democratic process’ works.**
For some time now, governments (State and Federal) have departed from this ‘norm’ and in an ‘over-reach of power’ have
‘assumed’ that ‘those in a position of authority’ should not only be the arbiters of policy-making but should also predetermine the outcome and result.
I consider the proposed (draft) Misinformation/Disinformation Bill by the Albanese Government a presumptuous ‘overreach’ of authority.
This proposal has attracted wide-spread criticism from the Australian Human Rights Commission, lawyers, media companies,
credible politicians and not least, concerned citizens.
The Government’s proposed Bill is a dangerous attack on ‘Free speech’ and is in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Article 19 says – ‘Everyone has the right to ‘freedom of opinion and expression’. Furthermore, this ‘right’ includes
‘Freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
**and regardless of frontiers’.**
**It is anathema, that a Communications Authority (ACMA) can be given the authority to ‘determine’ whether what people**
**communicate on media platforms, is, in its estimation, deemed Misinformation or Disinformation and whether or not ‘it is**
**likely to cause harm’.  The proposed Bill does not define what ‘Harm’ is. Harm to what or whom? Further, in determining**
**what ‘information’ is ‘acceptable’, this Authority will be given the licence to rely on Fact Checkers to ‘adjudicate’- and the**
**liberty to use data ‘selectively’ to form an ‘opinion’. Then, there is the matter of someone being defined as ‘inciting hatred’.**
**Should this be so THEN it is a matter for Criminal Law and not a Communications Authority, which has no Jurisdiction.**
In my view, this is another ‘furphy’ trotted out by an incompetent Government eager to ‘dance to the globalist agenda’. The
proposed Bil is false, misleading and deceptive. It is ‘selective’, imprecise, ‘subjective’ in content and ‘clumsy in argument.
In ‘essence’ it is bad law. It is a betrayal of the people of this country to be ‘muzzled’, intimidated, discouraged and
prevented from entering into ‘public debate’ on issues that affect each and every one of us. Everyone has a ‘right’ to
**Freedom of expression and ideas through any media. And also for ‘peaceful assembly’. It is NOT the province of ‘elected**
**parliamentary representatives’ to determine otherwise.**
**It represents a dangerous intrusion on civil and personal liberties and has all the hallmarks of ‘totalitarian control’. Over the**
**last 3 years, this country has been gutted. Do we give ‘mindless, shortsighted representatives’ further licence to do**
**irreparable damage and plunge this country into even greater confusion? I urge ‘thinking’ people to not allow this proposed**
**Bill to come into law.**

I like the quote – ‘All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility’ [Well, what more to say].
**Thank you for receiving my Submission.**

Sincerely
Corinne Smith
