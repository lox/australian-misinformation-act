    media landscape.
    Living in Australia will become comparable to living in a Soft Core North Korea with
    these laws. Maybe that's what you want. Because these censorship proposals are not
    compatible with an open and free society you know this. Any normal thinking person
    knows this.
    Australia will be a horrible place to live if these censorship laws come to pass. No
    one voted for these laws. You have gone off the rails completely even considering these
    laws. Whos thinking of these crazy laws you have gone mad. Australia would vote no to
    such laws guaranteed.
    How can a populace defend itself against a government lying to its own people with laws
    like this in force? Answer is "You Cannot". North Korea is not the answer for
    Australia. Just stop with these cruel laws you guys have gone mad. STOP. No one voted
    for this.
