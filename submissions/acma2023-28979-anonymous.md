To whom it may concern,

**Re: Misinformation & Disinformation Bill 2023**

I'm writing to oppose the upcoming Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

The prospect of freedom of speech being curbed or decided upon by a small minority of six members
of ACMA is concerning and simply makes no sense.

Equally concerning is the disparity between those that will be allowed to speak their version of truth,
and those who will be silenced for example under the Albanese Government's proposed laws, it
appears that communication channels will be monitored for anything the chosen few perceives to be
misinformation.

Free speech by ordinary Australians on particularly political matters will be flagged and
consequences unimaginable.

Further, this Bill will serve to not only dampen but cull engagement from our diverse population,
limiting their unique contributions toward equal opportunity.

The past three years have shown us clearly that there are multiple versions of a truth and that the
Government's truth is not necessarily the truth. In fact it has been proven in the courtrooms that
Government directives for our health and safety were in fact untruths. Fines have been reversed,
apologies issued but sadly lives taken based on the Government's truth will never be brought back.

Is yours not a given right to choose your toothpaste or outfit this morning? Or chosen where to
spend your $6 for your morning coffee and to have a conversation of your choice with the barista?
Does the Government or more specifically 6 ACMA members have the right to determine how you
interact or what opinions you have on your coffee or outfit?

I'm personally horrified that this Bill is even in consideration and strongly oppose the tabling of it. A
democratic society operates on free speech and ideas. Censoring information and disallowing
individuals the choice to use their critical thinking skills, turns democracy into a DICTATORSHIP, does
it not?

Sincerely,
