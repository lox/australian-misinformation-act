To Whom It May Concern,

I wish to express my concern and opposition to the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

As a stay-at-home mother of six children, I access digital platform services on a daily basis and
consider them an invaluable tool. Digital platforms such as YouTube and Facebook help me to stay
connected to my community and the rest of the world and provide me with information and
opinions that assist me in the better running of my household.

My main concern with the proposed bill is that the ACMA would be given the authority to decide
what is "the truth" and what constitutes "harm". This subjective definition leaves room for abuse of
power, and supress public debate and diverse opinions and perspectives. Open dialogue and
information sharing on digital platforms would be hindered and this would threaten freedom of
speech/expression and, therefore, threaten democracy.

I hope that this bill is withdrawn.

Sincerely,

Belinda Lanzon.
