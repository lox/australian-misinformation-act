This bill should not be allowed to pass. A government, an entity, or any individual should not have
the ability to decide what is considered to be misinformation. It has been proven over the course of
history that alternate opinions or points of view that were initially thought to be untrue were in fact
correct all the time. Do not stop Australians from having an opinion. Do not stop Australians from
broadcasting their opinion. Australians can decide what they wish to believe, not the government.
Australians need our freedom of speech. We are not a dictatorship state so stop this bill from
proceeding.
