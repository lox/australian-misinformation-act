Freedom of speech is an essential right of Australians, and a key element of our democracy.

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disin
formation) Bill 2023 is a direct and utterly reprehensible attack upon that right.

Ostensibly the Bill has been drafted to protect against 'misinformation' and 'disinforma
tion'. These are terms for which each person will have their own definition. For a govern
ment or government agency to be given power to define them risks a heavy-handed 'one

size fits all' approach. This, coupled with the provision for heavy financial penalties against

those who spread information which does not meet the approved standard, can only lead

to widespread censorship and a suppression of free speech.

There is furthermore a striking imbalance in the Bill's protection for government and main
stream media organisations. It is not beyond the imagination of many Australians that gov
ernment and mainstream media can spread false or slanted information, either by accident

or by design.

The proposed legislation can have no positive effect upon conversation and the free ex
change of ideas within the Australian community. It is, in fact, a shameful attempt to stifle

such exchange.

I call on the Prime Minister and his government to dispatch this Bill to its natural home:

the nearest available garbage bin.
