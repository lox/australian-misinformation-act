# The Bill will give ACMA the authority to “police” what they consider to be misinformation or disinformation on digital platforms without having to option to challenge their decision.

 Having a big stick to penalize corporations, social media platforms or individuals accused of sharing “misinformation” or “disinformation” with penalties ranging from $0.55 to $2.75 million is not Australian…

 How will the “they” decide if a platform service has the systems and processes in place to address misinformation or disinformation to meet the ACMA’s threshold of being likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.”

 Who defines what is mis or dis information? Who determines what is likely to cause “serious harm”? Covid showed that the “they” got it wrong… jabs did not stop a person from getting or spreading covid nor could any proof be provided that it was harm free.

 So if the category as outlined in the Fact Sheet, “Harm to the health of Australians” is applied as it was during covid, would that include such misinformation, now acknowledged as fact, as lockdowns doing more harm than good, or pharmaceutical products being linked to myocarditis be applied?

 Another category is “Harm to the Australian environment.” Will content that expresses scepticism about the Net Zero agenda be considered mis or dis information under the pretext of protecting us from climate change?

 And the same goes for harm includes “Hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or mental disability.”

 Will saying that men shouldn’t play women's sports, or defending traditional marriage, be considered “hate”?

 A healthy, functioning democracy requires freedom of speech, which means that ideas from across the ideological and political spectrum are discussed and debated with the hope that good arguments, guided by the light of truth, will win the day. However, words like harm, misinformation, and disinformation have been weaponised to shut down critics of the broader ideological agenda at work in western nations, with COVID being a prime example.
