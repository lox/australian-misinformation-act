Submission to Misinformation Disinformation bill 2023

To whom this may concern,

Today, Sunday the 30[th] of July, I Luke Hart have read through the “Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023” and here am providing my
submission. There is no restriction to this document, you have my authority to make it public.

One needs to ask themselves; “Why do these amendments exist?” you could argue that the overall
genetic make-up of media in general, not just in Australia but across the world has changed under
the evolution of online technological content. Social media platforms have been created off the back
not only of convenience among consumers, but the connectivity among users across a vast scale of
location. The access to information regarding multiple topics and beliefs has also expanded where
many across Australia and in fact the globe are learning a multitude of new ideas as well as learning
some pre-existing beliefs are questionable and in many cases provide further research.

For many we are in a period of “Question everything” and look for alternative sources of media as
we have become information hungry. Here we occasionally find better outcomes whether it be
political beliefs, economy or health impacts just to name a few. In the process, some long learnt
lessons from within societies systems (such as education for example) become replaced with a way
that is more suited to the individual. These learnings which are much more in depth than the 30minute nightly news cycle explain positive outcomes which do have the ability to outweigh the
original narrative. Which brings me to my first point: Exclusions.


On page 5, it is noted that
“Professional News Content” is to
be excluded from this bill. They are
still regulated which I understand,


however, in this new age of information sharing they too should be held accountable for
“Misinformation and Disinformation” set by any department which would include ACMA. The reason
being is across the globe we see one central influence that time and time again directs attention, this
being economy, or more frank terms “Money”. This of course equals power and the more power
given to one central corporation, institution or individual the more we see genuine freedoms
removed. Simple examples of this include; The sugar industry which once was tainted as “Healthy”
and the cigarette industry, which now is very heavily linked to cancer. In 2023, we still have these
challenges and the more distrust in systems that develop due to large corporate organizations
attempting to take over, the more people look for an alternative.

This brings me to my next point: Power


It needs to be brought to the attention
that providing this level of power to
“The Minister” could undermine the


freedom of speech we still enjoy in Australia. This found on page 11 spells the possibility of such
being given the authority to silence a digital platform basically through his or her opinion under the
banner of “adequate protection for the community” is something that needs heavy consideration
when debating this bill. What could be seen as “satire” by some, but perhaps something more by a
minister leaves the door wide open. A single opinion without any consultation is not democracy. This
is also covered on page 9 and page 11 when it comes to “Digital Service” which the minister could
also determine as per Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and


-----

Disinformation) Bill 2023. Open provisions of power unregulated handed over to a single person
given ministerial privilege not only to restrict, but to provide exclusions to ones he or she sees fit.

One thing that is very democratic and welcomed by much of the Australian public is debate and
there should be many avenues to do such a thing. Any dramatic changes to such lowers this nation’s
ability to remain a democratic society. Which brings me to my next point: Harm

Found on page 6, much of this I agree
with. We should not as a society commit
any hatred or segregation to any
Australian. We all should be given a fair

go, yet we are seeing the opposite of this not only among our community, but our media and even
our government. The main point that needs to be addressed, is that political protest needs to remain
a avenue for freedom of speech in this country if we are to remain a democracy. Wording “Disruption
of public order or society in Australia” is way too vague. What denotes “Public order”? Is a political
protest against something a large section of the community in the realm of public order? Joe Citizen
in his vehicle whose commute has been interrupted by a protest may submit such a complaint not
even understanding the intention of the protest. This would be a restriction of the community
gatherings freedom of speech which is their democratic right.

Through Australia evolving and continuing to evolve on a global scale, we perhaps are seeing a vast
genetic change in its political structure. The media has at times commented on perhaps the “right”
(side of politics) being “too far left” and the “left” being “too far right” creating confusion among our
citizens. This coincidentally opens the door for a new age political focus to the point where Australia
is becoming a multi-political party democracy which I personally see as an advantage for progression.
Our society evolving into more options for all Australians to be involved in. However, there are some
discrepancies that come about of this even at a top level. At this current point we have a referendum
and many a time, people have questioned why “grants” have been made available for one side of the
vote, yet not the other. Important next point related to this: Limitations


We have a very democratic uniformed
amendment or declaration of what this
bill needs to abide by. But we need to
remember this is restricted to social
media. It does not involve political
comment or even the professional news
content media. Advertisement of “yes”
campaigns to a referendum should come
under stringent review as quoted on page
31; “Unless matter communicated or
intended to be communicated for the
**dominant purpose of influencing the way**
electors vote in a state, territory or local
government election or referendum”.


If this be true, any sided campaign which has tax payer finance attached to it via social media would
be intercepted by ACMA. More importantly, if the side of the referendum which was not receiving
any funding share their side of the argument be restricted in anyway shape of form, yet the funded


-----

campaign not, then that’s a direct attack on our freedom of speech. As tax payers, we continue to
hold our right to proper public discourse. That’s something what makes Australia so great.

One needs to question the way not only policy but debate unfolds in ALL forms of media. Most of the
time, when something is put forward to the public, there is a large amount of advertisement that
goes with it. We are generally persuaded to believe that intentions are for our best interest no
matter what the situation in society is. Whether perhaps cost of living is hurting or not for example.

**Emerging circumstances is what we can see**
perhaps a “what if” things are not evolving to
plan. This clause appears to open up the
availability for swift action if things are getting
out of hand. Question is, what would this be
used for? Where a minister appears to be
given extra powers, so would ACMA. Where
would that decision come from? Say the
public are frustrated with things and putting
forward these frustrations across social media
where they do have somewhat have a voice,
who is to make that decision? Does it remain
in Australia or does it extend to a global
organization such as the United Nations?

Would the UN (and its affiliates) influence misinformation and disinformation if this bill is passed?
Information has been left out here which needs to be addressed. If the topic in question is good for
social media one day, but not once either the government in power or the organization attempting to
change international law outside of Australia but the citizens of Australia disagree with it, what other
platform do they have to express their opinion? My concern is suppression will come of this.

Little has been provided in what social media outlets new and pre-existing are to implement when it
comes to combatting misinformation and disinformation. However, we have seen social media giants
put in control measures which are meant to restrict content that is set to deceive. Terminology to
this comes along the wording of “fact checkers”. This document, even though social media giants
admit to these third-party organizations being more opinion based is merely a covering up of a
bigger problem. This major issue: Fact checkers is something of great concern.

On page 30, we see the wording of “supporting
fact checking” but there is no other context to

g the bill is extremely vague on.

this. We cannot just restrict people’s
expression just because someone or
organization disagree with them. Our future
generations deserve the right to question
things no matter where they come from,
mainly due to blunders listed earlier on sugar
and cigarettes. Other concerning points related
to this part of the bill include “using technology
to prevent or respond to misinformation or
disinformation on digital platform services”.

We have already understood that Artificial Intelligence has its issues and needs to be monitored.
Relying on technology to monitor discussion will be subject to the input of that system from the


-----

introduction of such a thing all for the sake of convenience and quite frank laziness. Any restriction
put on these social media giants or monetary fines will be passed onto the third-party fact checking
organizations, while our freedom of expression is compromised. Clarity needs to be addressed here,
for example ACMA intends to publish “misinformation or disinformation on digital platform services”
(Page 26). Who is to decide what becomes misinformation or disinformation outside the minister
involved? Are we relying on technology and employed “fact checkers” to decide? That completely
removes many examples of freedom of speech.


Again, on page 53 it is noted that “Will
readily accommodate technological
change” and “Encourages the development
of technologies relating to digital platform
services”. Correct me if I’m wrong, but the
reason we are having this bill is due to the
evolution of technology, isn’t it? So how
does encouraging more technology going
to fix the issue? Let’s face it, 95% of all
social media and fact checkers are going to
be from overseas, and they do not have
Australia’s best interest.


I understand the importance of regulating social media, but many of us can see through this. For
many years we have seen different legislation come about restricting, changing, amending but at the
end of the day, us bulk of the country middle class are constantly finding ways to live better, happier
and more for filled lives. Many professionals have spoken about the negative impacts of policy and
the like restricting our ability to thrive as a community. Tightening of the screws from multiple angles
is driving people away and forcing them to look for alternative options. If someone in Government
reads something and has the opinion that its misinformation or disinformation, then that’s merely on
their opinion, such as the content provided from them during a speech. There are concepts which do
require attention, but opening up the flood gates handing over power to this level is just cutting into
our democratic right as a free nation.

I truly believe Australia to be one of the smartest, easy-going places many once wanted to be a part
of which is built on that freedom of speech. Let’s not lose that just because powerful organizations
overseas want to dictate our policy. Afterall, we have every commodity under the sun and the
intellect to create and produce anything. We just do not step into that realm due to short cycles of
government and a compulsory voting public who don’t actually (in general sense) care about what
evolves. Why? because they get the same no matter who is in power.

Thankyou for reading my Submission, my name is Luke Hart and my contact details are within the
email this document is attached to.
