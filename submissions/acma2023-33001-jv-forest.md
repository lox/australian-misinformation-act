To whom it may concern,

**RE: Exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

The assertion that this bill is based on, ie “Misinformation and disinformation pose a
threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and
economy.”, is an unfounded statement.

Misinformation and disinformation are terms that have gained notoriety over the last few
years since the covid pandemic and despite hysterical claims that people voicing different
opinions online is a catastrophe, the vast majority of Australians did exactly what the
government asked of them over the last few years. This is a pretty big indication that
increased censorship and ‘monitoring’ is not required.

Dissenting opinions are required in order to advance society and build trust. If one can’t
fully explore both sides of an issue, how can one formulate a considered response?
If this enforceable ‘code of practice’ has parameters that indicate any deviation from
government sanctioned information is to be removed, blacklisted, grey listed or otherwise
impeded, then Australia risks being on the ‘forefront’ of fascism by creating ‘harmful online
misinformation and disinformation’ that can’t be properly challenged, rather than being
celebrated for ‘tackling’ it.

Do you remember when Thalidomide was safe and effective? When smoking was
recommended by doctors to help keep birth weights smaller? What about those ‘weapons
of mass destruction’? How about lead in paint and petrol? That is just a few examples off
the top of my head of medical, industrial and government errors.

Contentious issues tend only to be addressed when enough people become concerned on
an issue and that sparks funding, investigation or politically motivates closer scrutiny of
that issue. Having bureaucrats decide what is and is not to be heard on the public square
that is today’s social and online media, will prevent that from happening.
Many issues are not as clear cut good / bad, right or wrong as my above examples. Many
have shades of grey; pros and cons to actions. A free society lets citizens discuss issues
and make up their own minds.

This bill feels very patronising. It seems to assume that Australians are really stupid and
can’t make informed decisions. I disagree and beg you to please throw out this terrible
piece of legislation and have some faith in our people.
The role of government is to update and maintain public infrastructure and assets (both
built and natural), & to represent Australia overseas, etc but lately it seems that it feels its
main role is control everyone for group ‘safety’. It is not possible to keep everyone safe
from every thing in the world and is beyond the scope of a properly functioning
representative government.

However, if I can’t convince you to throw the lot out, then please at least consider these
**amendments:-**
Amending the exclusions in section 2- Professional news outlets, accredited educational
institutions and government organisations need to be held to the highest level of scrutiny
for accuracy as they are supposed to be trusted sources of information. They need to be
included so please delete (b) (c) (d) and (e). It is literally their job to get things right and


-----

_they have many resources to accomplish this. It is not right to hold ordinary citizens to_
**_a higher standard than the authorities._**

Under the section harm definitions please add medical conditions into point (a) as too
many people that have genuine and serious medical situations have been the target of
online hatred.

Under the examples in the guidelines to the bill on harms, people peacefully protesting
an issue or advertising of a protest need to be explicitly excluded from the ‘disruption
**of public order’ clause to maintain democratic process.**

Also, either add definitions to section 2 or amend clause 7(1)(a) to explicitly define ‘false,
misleading and deceptive’ and to make it clear that it refers to demonstrably false
information and not just information that is politically inconvenient.

Ingenuity is fostered through rigorous debate and sharing all sorts of ideas, please don’t
hamstring our great country. Truely great innovation and public ‘safety’ is not likely to be
progressed within the bureaucratic echo chamber of ACMA sanctioned truth.

Sincerely,

JV Forest
