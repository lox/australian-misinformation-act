Sirs,

I am writing in opposition to the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Who has the power or the knowledge or the right to determine what is and what is not misinformation and disinformation? We already have laws in place covering criminal behaviour online
we do not need this Bill.

Discernment is an ability that we, as adults, have the right to exercise. If information, whether
true or not, is spoon fed to us, you rob us of our right to discernment.

If there is one thing that the last three years has taught us, gagging the population to control a
narrative, is dangerous, damaging, and results in power being handed to the self serving, rather
than for the collective good of all.

A government that can censor its critics has licence for any atrocity. It is the beginning of Totalitarianism. There has never been a time in history when we look back and the guys that were
censoring people were the good guys.

You say the new law will not apply to government, government media or government approved
businesses. If the law doesn’t apply to everyone, then it’s not the law, it’s just corruption.

I believe it is a time for openness and transparency if there is to be any trust restored in government, media and the medical profession.

My Grandfather served in WW2 and Great-Grandfather in WW1. They fought to defend our freedoms including free speech. They would never agree to these hard won freedoms being taken
away from us now.

I hope that you listen to the voices of the Australian people, in wanting this legislation refused.

The world works when people tell the truth. Once You Start Censoring, You're On Your Way To
Dystopia And Totalitarianism.

Regards
Sean Dewling
