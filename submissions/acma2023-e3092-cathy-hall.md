Good evening,

Please find attached my submission response to the "New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation". I do not mind if you publish my name but do not publish my email address, nor my
residential address nor my P.O. Box address, and NOT my mobile number. I believe the Privacy Act
would ensure this, however I wanted this recorded.

I write to emphasise the great importance of free speech.

The relevance of discussing topics and views of all nature with all people in Australia and across our
world is so very important to each and every one of us, in order to demonstrate the peopleâ€™s unique
means of communicating, to be heard, to be listened to by expressing feelings of concerns and
experiences in order to help one another come to reach agreeable terms in order to move forward with
love and harmony. Free speech in all its diverse ways, is very important to us all.

The past three years has proven how vitally important it is for human beings, (us the people) to
communicate freely with one another and our whole wide world of people, who are our brothers and
sisters of every race and creed and how very much we value each other. Freedom of speech, after all,
is our God given right.

Through freedom of speech we have managed to come up with ideas, solve problems, invent great and
wonderful things that has helped each other as well as all mankind.

History has proven to us over the decades and centuries, that some authoritative figures have been
known to have addressed the public, the nations, spreading disinformation and misinformation,
information that they knowingly knew to be false, deliberately misleading people to place their trust in
their leadership. Therefore it is up to the people to consult with one another by means of free speech in
order to not get caught up in the entanglement of misinformation and disinformation.

We the people, have proven in past times to give each other love, support, hope and salvation through
the power God using prayer which gives us guidance, strength and wisdom enabling us to share freedom
of knowledge and freedom of speech to help protect one another from the tyranny and
authoritarianism that might otherwise tale hold.

Yours in Good Faith
Cathy Hall
