Social Media Censorship bill submission

16.8.23

Regulate truth?

I would like to quote Mr. John Lander, former Australian Deputy Ambassador to China and Iran when
he himself quoted Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda minister for the Nazi Party. When asked at
his trial how he got the people, of Germany, to obey (I paraphrase here); Goebbels simply said that
you keep people in fear, you tell them the enemy is going to attack and you tell them that what the
government is doing is for their own good. - This is what is going on now. There is a war in Ukraine
which may escalate to become a world war, NATO and Australia are already involved logistically at
least. We shouldn’t be! Is our Australian government pursuing diplomacy and dialogue with Russia?
No. Only face-to-face meetings, or direct channel talks between opposing sides can bring the truth to
the table and set us all free. President Kennedy did that and avoided war because he stood in the
enemy’s shoes and opened communication. He did not accept his own sides misinformation and
disinformation. Thank God he did so. We are again in grave times, and we should take a page out of
his life’s lessons.

The lies, misinformation and deception that led to the illegal Iraq war that killed over one million
Iraqi’s and over 100,000 civilians are criminal, but none of our so-called leaders of the West stood
trial or went to jail! Government disinformation via media propaganda anyone?

Misinformation and disinformation are harmful but so is lack of healthcare, war, homelessness, child
poverty, hyperinflation of the property bubble. All these man-made problems have man-made
solutions.

Do you trust your government? I don’t and especially not since 2018 when “Bail-in” was passed
through near empty lower and upper houses of parliament on 14 February 2018. The Financial
sector amendment (Crisis resolution powers and other measures) bill gave banks the authority to
keep ordinary deposits to stop the bank from failing. The government guarantee of $250,000 in
individual deposits per ADI is not activated, but there are plenty of emails from MP’s who wrote to
their constituents that their deposits were guaranteed “when a bank fails”. Bail-in kicks in before any
guarantee, even if it were activated. Shame!

I want it known that I do not want this bill for it is un-Australian, Orwellian, and fascist in its nature.
Government should be held accountable and not exempt from public scrutiny. Freedom of speech
was the first of the four freedoms that Franklin D Roosevelt enshrined along with freedom of
religion, freedom of association and freedom from fear. The following is a 1941 draft segment of that
speech in which he said that these freedoms were universal and applied to every human being.
