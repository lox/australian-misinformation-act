_Response to Communica/ons Legisla/on Amendment (Comba7ng Misinforma/on and_
_Disinforma/on) Bill 2023_

The most obvious problem with this Bill is the defini5on of Misinforma5on and
Disinforma5on.

Who determines what is false or misleading? How do they determine it?

Will ACMA keep public records of each determina5on of false informa5on they’ve made, and
how they’ve arrived at their decision?

What happens if a decision they’ve made, later turns out to be an incorrect decision, in that
they informa5on they have suppressed, turns out to be accurate?

This bill, with its vague defini5on of mis/disinforma5on, has the poten5al to contribute
towards undermining our democracy. Our democracy currently is robust, because it is flexible
and can change when new informa5on comes to light, by elec5on of new leaders. If
informa5on is determined to be false by unknown and unelected people, that are
unaccountable, this ossifies our democracy, and risks producing a por5on of the popula5on
that hold different views, who are unheard. The poten5al to produce extremists and radicals
is then much higher, because you leave those people out of the conversa5ons that will or are
held on the dominant form of popula5on communica5on, being social media.

What is the need for this bill? Laws rightly already exist to criminalise hate speech, incitement,
threats, etc, so the Bill is obviously not addressing extreme forms of communica5on.

The best way of dealing with misinforma5on and disinforma5on is to expose it and debate it.
This approach has worked for western civilisa5on for thousands of years. To censor those with
undesirable and poorly thought-out views, allows those ideas to propagate undebated and
without challenge, underground.

It might be temp5ng to say that social media is unique in history, and therefore must be
treated differently from all other forms of communica5on. However new forms of
communica5on have regularly been invented throughout history. It is flawed to say that social
media is somehow different. What makes it different? What’s the jus5fica5on to single out
social media? Is there a limit of the number of people that it can reach, and a par5cular
5meframe of delivery, over which it suddenly becomes unique? This is a vague and arbitrary
decision to regulate social media differently from other forms of communica5on.

What jus5fica5on is there to exclude governments, educa5onal ins5tutes and news services
from misinforma5on laws? Is it ok for those bodies to produce misinforma5on? Or is it just
that its recognised the extreme totalitarian power that one small part of the execu5ve
government (ACMA) would suddenly have over the en5re country if they were included? If

this is the case, how can it be jus5fied that the common person be subjected to that same
extreme totalitarian power?

In the realm of science, most scien5fic discoveries, when first hypothesised and
demonstrated, were rejected by the majority of the discoverer’s peers. Galileo is the most
famous example, with his theory of heliocentralism being rejected by the Catholic Church
(who was the authority considered to be the arbiter of truth at that 5me), leading to his arrest.
He was arrested for heresy, which is a belief or theory that is strongly at odds with established
beliefs or customs. Arguably, his discovery eventually led to “harm” as defined in the Bill, being
_disrup/on of… society in which he lived, due to the implica5ons and subsequent discoveries_
that were related – space travel, satellites, rela5vity… the list is endless. Under this Bill,
Galileo’s fate would have been exactly the same as it was in the 1600s.
