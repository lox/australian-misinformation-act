I will say No to this new bill where you decide what is disinformation or misinformation to
protect my mental health from harm, being on what I can read and can say on line. I will
decide what is the truth for me and most other people will too. This is too much power and a
restriction of freedom for a fallible Government or corporation to have and decide for a
Nation. Mr Kerry Leigh
