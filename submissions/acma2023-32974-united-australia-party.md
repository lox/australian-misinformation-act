# How will ‘misinformation’ be defined ?

For avoidance of doubt, we recommend that the Bill include a formal definition of the word
‘misinformation’ and this should be taken from the Dictionary of Newspeak 11[th] Edition.

Afterall, this definition is already being used by Facebook and YouTube to censor opinions.
