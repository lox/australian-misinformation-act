# Subject: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023


# Dear Sir/Madam,


# I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed censorship bill currently under consideration by the Australian government. As a concerned citizen, I firmly believe that this bill poses a significant threat to our fundamental rights, particularly our freedom of speech and the ability to form our own opinions.

 At the heart of this issue is the realization that neither the government, mainstream media or social media should serve as the sole arbiters of information. It has become increasingly apparent that the mainstream media often fails to provide a comprehensive and unbiased view of events. We have witnessed numerous instances where media outlets have propagated falsehoods, omitted crucial details, or presented information with a clear bias. Consequently, it is imperative that individuals have the freedom to seek out alternative sources, question the mainstream narrative, and arrive at their own conclusions.

 By allowing the government to exert control over the flow of information, we risk perpetuating a system where the dissemination of facts becomes subjective and susceptible to manipulation. Rather than relying on a single source of information, it is vital that we foster an environment where citizens have the autonomy to access a variety of perspectives and news outlets. This plurality of voices promotes healthy debate, critical thinking, and the ability to challenge prevailing narratives.

 Furthermore, empowering individuals to exercise their freedom of speech and thought does not imply that everyone will arrive at the same conclusions. On the contrary, it acknowledges our capacity as intelligent beings to question and evaluate information. We are fully capable of sifting through a multitude of viewpoints, conducting independent research, and making informed decisions based on the evidence available to us.

# In light of these considerations, I urge you to reconsider the proposed censorship bill. Instead, let us focus on strengthening media literacy education, encouraging responsible information consumption, and fostering an environment where multiple sources of information can coexist without government interference. By doing so, we empower citizens to critically assess the information they encounter and make decisions based on their own judgment.

 I implore you to listen to the concerns of the Australian people and recognize the dangers of granting the government excessive control over the dissemination of information. Let us embrace the diversity of thought, encourage open dialogue, and safeguard the principles that underpin a democratic society.

 Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will give my concerns the consideration they deserve.


# Sincerely,


# Patrice Savage
