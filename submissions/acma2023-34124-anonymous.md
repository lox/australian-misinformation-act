     Growing up in the Soviet Union, I encountered a unique perspective on freedom of
     expression. One day, as a curious schoolkid, I posed a question to my teacher:
     "What things are you not allowed to say against the Soviet authorities and
     Soviet way of life?" The teacher looked surprised and answered along the
     following line - "It is up to the authorities to decide."
      The Soviet Union has long since dissolved, relegated to the annals of history.
     Yet, the lessons of those years continue to reverberate. I can't help myself
      noticing the eerie similarity of the proposed Bill to my childhood experiences.
      Who and how are going to decide what misinformation is? How open and democratic
     is this process going to be? I could not find satisfactory answers in the
      proposed Bill.
     It is imperative that we safeguard the right to speak openly, fostering an
     environment where dialogue and dissent can flourish without fear of reprisal.
     As such I would like to express my strong opposition to the proposed
     Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
     Disinformation) Bill 2023 bill and urge the government to withdraw this Bill.
