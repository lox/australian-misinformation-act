To the submissions board,

As an Australian, I am writing to express my extreme concern regarding the draft
of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Act 2023. I do not believe that it strikes an appropriate balance on
the issue of freedom of expression.

The new bill would allow the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) to require digital platforms to screen information shared for so-called
“misinformation and disinformation”. My concern is that an overriding authority
becomes the arbiter of deciding what is misinformation and disinformation. I
believe that we, as individuals, are capable of considering all presented
information and making our own informed decisions as to what we do, and do not,
believe. If a governmental authority has the power to decide for us what is the
“true and only” narrative, we are being treated as children, incapable of making
our own informed decisions. There is no freedom of expression if what we are
being shown is being moderated by the ACMA, or the digital media platforms
under incentives or threat of ACMA censure if they do not comply with
moderation.

This bill defines misinformation as online content that is false, misleading or
deceptive and disinformation as the same but with the intent to cause serious
harm. Who, in these cases, is deciding what is false, misleading or deceptive? Even
experts in many different fields hold opposing and conflicting opinions, based on
cherry-picked data that suggest one thing or another. Just because you agree
with a particular expert does not mean that they are the one and only source of
ultimate truth. Many things in the course of history have been declared false by
experts, only to be later found to be true (such as the earth going around the sun,
instead of the sun going around the earth). Without the ability to put out all kinds
of theories and viewpoints, there would be no discussion, no rational thought, no
progress of ideas and information. “However pernicious an opinion may seem, we
depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries, but on the
competition of ideas” (This is a quote by the US Supreme Court in Gertz v. Welch).
No government or independent entity has the right to decide for each and every
individual what line of thought they must pursue, including through slowing
dissemination of views suspected of falsity. If they take that course, they are
removing free thought and expression from the individual, and we are rapidly
moving away from democracy and down the path of totalitarianism.

I also question the power given to the ACMA to determine what is likely to cause
serious harm. The ACMA is not a parent, making decisions about what will, or will
not, cause harm to its children. It is an agency that seems determined to sterilise
the environment from anything potentially difficult to digest for some people. For
instance, if I was to say “A person cannot change their sex”, which is a personal
opinion based in biology, the proposed powers could declare that to be hate
speech and therefore harmful to a small percentage of the population who
disagrees with that, making it qualify as disinformation under their rules, and
therefore amenable to censorship. Surely, it would be better to encourage debate
and conversation about such things, rather than complete censorship of a

particular point of view. He who refuses to engage in debate is often he who
knows his argument has no merit or validity and so avoids all engagement instead.

Reject this bill in its entirety and restore freedom of expression to the individual,
where it should always remain.

Sincerely,
