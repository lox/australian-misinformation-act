Right now 20 Aug 2023 we are in historically important and critical times. If our Men and Women
in uniforms be it military or police do not face up to the reality of our situation on both domestic
and global fronts. We will as a nation be blindly led into a war against our neighbour as a result of
media lies and foreign interference. Good men who should be promoted to positions of authority
as they have proven themselves worthy of such RESPONSIBILITY. People like David McBride,
and Boyle, Julian Assange…, are being persecuted for doing the right thing. For doing what the
public expect of good men and women working for the public interest. For telling the truth!
Men and women in uniform. Australia NEEDS YOU. Australia needs to see those whom are
responsible for the good guys going to jail instead of the criminals they exposed investigated. This
is not right! ALARM BELLS SHOULD BE ARE RINGING!!! DO NOT TURN A BLIND EYE!
The corruption goes all the way to the top and they are not going to authorise investigations into
themselves. You are required to back each other up and investigate the top. One or two whistle
blowers they will attempt to control and make an example of, but they can’t control a united force
of human beings in uniform that form the Australian community. Investigate them, hold them to
account. Lest our nation fall on your watch.

This bill to censor social media whilst giving Murdoch (American) a free pass in Australia.
Similar laws are popping up in other parts of the world particularly ones that are aligned somehow
with the USA and/ or IMF, WEF, WHO (all of which are seeking a power grab over all our lives in
unethical ways (Bill Gates GMO mosquitos intended as “vaccine vectors” or messing with our
sunlight and our food, or reducing the population. What is with all the anomalies in information
flows regarding birth rates dropping post Vaccine mandates?

At a time when our “representatives” are hiding information on all manner of important matters
these laws are proposed to control the flow of information. Much like they already have in
collusion with social media companies which proved a detrimental action. With thousands of
vaccine injured censored from telling their own true experience. Tens of thousands more would
eventuate as we were all denied informed consent. Right when the whole world is learning the
corruption goes ALL the way to the tops of authority and globalists seek to consolidate power.
The free speech of Australians comes under attack by our own representatives (seemingly?) in
government. As they act in unison with similar laws in other countries infected with WEF Young
Global Leaders.
We already know that the regulators are improper. Have failed in their duties from health to
defence to finance often regulating the very thing that funds them (OBVIOUS conflict of interest in
health and defence). Now that we see actions to benefit Australia are being blocked to stop the
wealth of Australia flowing back to its people. Solutions like postal bank that will secure our
access to money (physical) and provide loans, the nationalisation of energy, infrastructure,
insurance, mining.

At this juncture of technological advancement that is transforming the world at such a fast
exponential pace and quickly presenting opportunities to put in place systems where by
combining AI, Biometrics, smart cameras, privacy loss, gps technology, digital Identification and
Central bank digital currency establish the frame work for a Dictatorship at the flick of a switch.
Free speech is among our democracies last peaceful form of defence. Citizens Protection against
the potential misuse and/or abuse of power these technologies provide government and
corporations have not been thought threw and implemented prior to these technologies being
imposed on Australians.

Now at this time the Government wants to put into law what they have already done to improperly
manipulate Australians by combining influence of mainstream media and censoring social media.
Only after the passing of this bill social media companies will effectively be compelled to comply
via exuberant fines and litigation risk with the door left open to compulsion.

This bill is an obvious attack on Australians and I would be cautious in thoughts of putting my
name on this bill. It will be a nail the coffin of true democracy.
This Bill presents a greater threat to Australia than the thing it claims to combat.

The only cure for mis and disinformation is open public debate with a transparent government
that is held to account.

Sincerely
Australian.
