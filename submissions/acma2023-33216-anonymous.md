Submission re- New ACMA Powers:

Firstly, the most glaring issue I have with this legislation is the exemptions list of organisations and
bodies that this misinformation bill will not apply to. The government and the corporate media are
the main parties this legislation should apply to. This bill comes across as the broadcasted
intention of the government to continue lying to the public and using the media as a propaganda
unit for hire. It would be quite laughable if it weren’t such a grievous threat to transparency,
freedom of speech and democracy.

One the topic of public consultation, the one entry that references consulting an independent
entity is so feeble and empty that it truly confirms the contempt the government and the
bureaucracy has for the Australian public. Anyone even vaguely aware of the role NGOs have
played in recent years will realise that such consultation with a “relevant independent body” will
simply amount to confirmation from a government friendly NGO or think tank, funded by a vested
interest that the agenda of the day be pushed through without regard for the Australian public.

Finally, who is it that will determine what misinformation is? And what happens when what the
government insists is misinformation turns out to be be true? I suspect the ultimate goal of this
legislation is to ensure whatever the government of the day decides is “misinformation”, remains
misinformation permanently regardless of whether it is actually true or not. Specifically in the case
of anything that is inconvenient or incriminating of the Australia government state or federal,
vested interests the government is beholden to (oil and gas, corporate agriculture,
pharmaceuticals and the military industrial lobbies come to mind).

Best to trash this bill and start again, it’s far too easily abused…. however that is no doubt the
entire point of it.
