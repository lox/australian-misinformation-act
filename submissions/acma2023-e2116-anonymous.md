I am an Australian Senior citizen, born and lived all my life here in this great nation of Australia. I have never before heard of
anything like this proposed “Misinformation Bill” which is terrible. It will damage free speech, even if that is unintended. Freedom
of speech is a fundamental human right and must be safeguarded. This bill is in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Section 18 and 19 to which Australia is a signatory.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective
and can be misinterpreted. What is interpreted by someone as harmful, may be interpreted by another person as helpful, and it
could be seen as something others need to hear for their own benefit. It is simply not possible for governments to regulate such
subjectivity.

Australians have felt restrictions on what they can and cannot say infringing on their freedom of speech over the past several
years. This proposed bill is an extreme overreach of our freedom of speech.

It must be rejected.

I strongly advocate that the citizens of Australia, of which I am one, be allowed to continue to hold our government to account.
