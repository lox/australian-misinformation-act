I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

If this bill is passed, it will inhibit people's ability to receive information through social media. Why should Australians' human
rights be so violated? Are we now living in a dictatorship like North Korea?

It is not the job of the Government to say " You can say and think this, but you cannot say and think that. " If such power is given
to unelected power-hungry people, it will be far too tempting to abuse this power.

You must fight against this bill with all the weapons at your disposal.
