Here is my opinion on the Communication Legislation Amendment for mis/disinformation online.

Firstly, I inherently do NOT believe it is the government’s role to police information posted online
unless it contravenes Common law and Civil law. What I mean by this is what is related to blatantly
criminal activity. To quote the most egregious example that comes to mind; child pornography.

I do not believe any government Minister, department, section, committee, or workgroup, should be
the arbitrator of what is deemed misinformation or disinformation. I wish to explain why, and I will
also enclose a personal experience or testimony.

In my experience, what is deemed mis/disinformation is often subjective. Authoritative established
“fact checkers” claim objectivity. They claim reference to established bodies, whether scientific based
or organization based. Therein lies the issue of what is truly objective.

The scientific model, by definition, embraces to be questioned, to be scrutinized, to be criticized, to
be debated. I have heard far too many times in the past 3 years that we MUST trust the science, we
cannot question the science, we are not qualified, we don’t know what we are talking about. The
laity has every right to question the science.

My general example is The Covid Pandemic and I will share a small personal testimony. I live in
Western Australia and work for the State Government in an IT role at a small department that comes
under the umbrella of the states education department. Then Premier, Mark McGowan, under
advice from the Chief Health Office, Andy Robertson, put in place Covid vaccine mandates that were
classified into 3 main groups:

I interpreted this to classify myself into the bottom or 3[rd] group’

An Email was then received from the of the Dept of on the 26[th] Oct 2021:

I declined based on the following reasons:

I never experienced anymore pressure for vaccination after my “WITHOUT PREJUDICE” reply as cited
above. I stood up to the pressure to be vaccinated based on poor interpretation of a public health
order. “They” were acting on information they misinterpreted and then repeatedly pressure me based
on their own misinformation.

Why am I sharing this? Simple, the state Dept I worked in could not interpret the health order in my
sector and insisted to pressure myself for my vaccine record and to be vaccinated. Misinformation
occurs in government. If government can’t get the scope of to whom a simple mandate applies to,
then I cannot trust government to be the truth on what is deemed misinformation. Questioning
everything is essential and my right to do so needs to be enshrined. That is what free speech is. The
government is not qualified to determine what is misinformation or disinformation. I realise we do not
have a Bill of Rights in this country but such a Bill’s express purpose is to restrict government; not to
empower governments. This Communication Legislation Amendment for mis/disinformation online is
designed to empower government and it is government that should not be allowed to determine what
is “truth” online. For want of an overused term, no government should even think of enacting a
“Ministry of Truth”.

I strongly oppose the amendment and hope the example I shared expresses the point. If a relatively
simple issue like the example I shared, shows the inadequacy, I can only fear for the greater good, the
need for true freedom of speech. We have a fundamental right to question authority, science, so called
fact checkers. Social media such as Twitter are meant to be public spaces, town squares. People can
mute, people can block, people chose who they follow. The government should have NO role in this.
It’s that simple.

Sincerely,
