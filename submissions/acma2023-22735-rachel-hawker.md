**SUBMISSION RE: COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (Combating**
**Misinformation and Disinformation Bill)**

This Bill is an attack on freedom of speech and does not align with Australia’s international
human right’s obligations and is inconsistent with equivalent European laws. The Bill gives
licence to the Government to silence religious and political speech if it does not agree with a
particular point of view.

It is hypocritical for Government’s communications to be exempt from the Bill. Australia is a
democratic country where it’s citizens enjoy the freedom of speech which this Bill will
destroy and align us with countries that are not democratic.

This Bill puts too much power into unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the public
square.

The severity of the penalties for not complying with the misinformation codes and
standards provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.
