Freedom of speech is paramount. Citizens of a free and democratic country must always have the freedom of speech and the
freedom to have differing points of view.
Governments are regularly wrong on many issues so are in no position to be determining what is misinformation. Governments
have been shown to often be the disseminators of misinformation.
Freedom of speech must always be protected.

Yours Sincerely
