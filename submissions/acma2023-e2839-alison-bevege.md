Submission on the exposure draft of the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment
###### (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

20 August 2023

Alison Bevege, Letters From Australia (Substack)

I am making this submission in my role as a journalist and writer on Substack

##### SUMMARY

This proposed legislation sets up the Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA)

as a powerful censorship organ of the state. The effect will be that ACMA controls everything
###### that Australians can see, hear and say online through industry codes of practice enforced by
Big Tech corporations.

This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine what is "untrue,
misleading or deceitful" (misinformation) when they have no such ability. ACMA doesn't know
(and cannot know) what is true. It therefore cannot preside over, set and enforce
misinformation codes of practice.

This is outsourced state censorship, totalitarian in scope, designed to control the public
conversation and camouflaged as protection.

###### Misinformation is jargon for being wrong, and disinformation is a made-up word for lying.

The government should not be in the business of determining "truth" for the Australian public.

This legislation should therefore be rejected in full.

Section 1: what is ACMA, what do they do, and why are they pushing for this

Section 2: Dodgy research creates a fictional "misinformation threat" to justify censorship

Section 3: This law is meant to destroy the refuge of dissidents such as Substack, Rumble

Section 4: Terrifying excerpts of the actual proposed legislation

Section 5: In conclusion


-----

```
    1) What is ACMA?

```
Australia's media regulator ACMA is a federal government bureaucracy of 514 employees1
formed in 2005 to regulate broadcasting, radiocommunications, telecommunications and
online content.

###### It does useful things such as planning the radiofrequency spectrum, collecting licensing fees
and fining SMS spammers.2 It regulates broadcasters3 ensuring a percentage of Australian-
made content is aired on TV and radio, and investigates complaints including about decency.

The problems begin when its remit requires it to regulate media content, both broadcast and
online.

ACMA is required to interfere in news and current affairs content, including polemics and talk
shows, using industry codes of practice.

This puts ACMA in a difficult position, turning it into a censorship organ and forcing it to
become an arbiter of truth in areas where such determinations may not even be possible.

1.1) ACMA tried to censor the internet including Wikileaks

An early warning on using ACMA as a censorship bureau came when the Federal Government
###### tried to "filter" the internet by forcing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block websites it didn't like.

They sold it as necessary for our safety, to block dangerous crime and child porn.

But during the trial period in 2009, ACMA's government blacklist of banned websites was
leaked and published by WikiLeaks.4 Several Wikileaks sites were on the banned list. Surprise!

Embarrassed, the Federal Government tried to hide the list and denied Wikileaks was on it
(they were). Then they referred the leak to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for criminal
investigation.

###### with a blacklist, ISPs instead used existing legislation to block Interpol's list of child abuse
websites.'

Turns out, that's all that was needed.

The lesson was learnt about the danger of government censorship. Until now.

1.2) ACMA again now censors at ISP level

In 2015 a new statutory government office called the eSafety Commissioner was created to
stop bullying and abuse online, including incitement to violence and child abuse material.

All the staff except for eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant are employed by ACMA.6

In 2021 the Online Safety Act was passed beefing up the powers of the office.'

The new laws gave the eSafety Commissioner the power to demand ISPs and social media
services reveal the true identities of anonymous users when investigating complaints about
cyber-bullying or illegal activity.

The Commissioner also got the power to compel ISPs to block websites at server level. Just like
in 2009.

The Commissioner can send a "link deletion notice" or an "app deletion notice" and they must
take it down. [8]

The legislation created mandatory industry codes to compel ISPs, social media platforms,
search engines, messaging services and app stores to censor illegal and restricted content.

Just like in 2009 it is couched in terms we would all agree on such as banning images of
abhorrent acts (eg: rape) or blocking the streaming of violence such as the Christchurch
massacre.

Just like in 2009 this is marketing to sell you censorship, because illegal acts are covered by
existing legislation.

And here's the problem: this time nobody is going to leak the censorship lists to Wikileaks.
Julian Assange is now locked in a UK prison.

stakeholders" both in Australia and internationally to co-ordinate censorship activities.9

One of these "stakeholders" is the World Economic Forum (WEF), a lobby group of the world's
largest corporations and billionaire oligarchs.10 The WEF pushes for political power through
"stakeholder capitalism".

"Stakeholder capitalism" is a new ideology that wants to supplant old systems like
communism or capitalism with a "fourth industrial revolution". Stakeholder capitalism is all
about sidelining democracy in favour of technocratic control, disguised as philanthropy.11

It's about selection, not election. They appoint people, you don't get to vote for them. It
replaces free speech with selected voices - and they choose those voices. It is anti-democratic.
###### It doesn't want you to control your country. Stakeholder capitalism loves the permanent
bureaucracies of government because it can work with them, influence them and capture
them.

###### It is important to understand the ideology that has infiltrated into the push for this law.

It's not about protecting Australia from harm, it's about controlling the public conversation so
you are not free.

The WEF appointed Commissioner Grant as one of their "#Agile50, the world's most influential
leaders revolutionising government", her profile says,12 and briefed her on the launch of their
digital safety principles in January.[13]

In 2022 at the WEF's annual Davos shindig, Ms Inman Grant said it would be necessary to
recalibrate human rights online "from freedom of speech to the freedom to be free from
online violence".[14]

Notice the conflation of speech (words) with violence (a physical act).

produce a report categorising "online harms" in August.

###### It listed some real harms such as doxxing and sextortion.

But then comes "misinformation", a made-up term to complicate being wrong, and
###### "disinformation" which means lying.

This jargon, "misinformation and disinformation", is used to create a problem that seems
technical and difficult to understand so that you might need an "expert".

Permanent Canberra bureaucracies and the WEF are feeding a new, fake industry of
###### "misinformation experts" that is propagated by PR firms such as Weber Shandwick16, which
represents Pfizer and Moderna.17

The "experts" then produce research to justify the censorship that the bureaucracy wants, so
###### that it can act.

They traffic in analysis based on these fake terms so the state can seize powers and crush
those who dissent from the agenda.

This is what ACMA did when it commissioned such research to lobby for this legislation (more
on this below).

###### In reality there is no qualification that enables someone to identify misinformation in a way that you are not able to by simply checking provenance and evidence.

ACMA, the WEF and the eSafety Commissioner are trying to create a problem in order to
###### justify censoring the internet.

The joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report reclassifies misinformation (being wrong) and
disinformation (lying) as harms that the government needs to deal with â€” as if the worst lies
###### hadn't repeatedly come from government itself. Australia's TGA still pretends the covid gene-
vaccines prevent you catching and spreading covid after almost every triple-jabbed adult in
the land caught the virus.18

The purpose of the joint WEF-eSafety Commissioner report is to provide "foundational
terminology" for "multistakeholder discussions", the report says. That means corporate lobby

###### report.

"These discussions in turn can facilitate the creation of policies and interventions that
effectively address online harms," it goes on to say.

That is the purpose of terms like "misinformation" and "disinformation" being categorised as
"harms". It justifies the state controlling your speech with "interventions".

Leading journalist Glenn Greenwald has observed that nothing has been more destructive or
dangerous in history than the power of the state to suppress and criminalise opinions it
dislikes. The entire history of human knowledge is nothing more than the realisation that
yesterday's truths are today's shameful errors. 19

###### 1.4) Example of ACMA acting as a Ministry of Truth

ACMA has already been using industry codes of practice to interfere in current affairs
broadcasting. It is problematic and time-consuming. Sometimes it's simply not possible to
know what the "truth" is in cases of disputed science.

So this legislation outsources the bother of comment and post deletions to the Big Tech
platforms. Google, Meta et al will censor your speech according to ACMA's rules set out in the
industry code, but without bothering ACMA with the nitty gritty. With the advent of Al this will
be easy: the algorithms can do most of the work.

As an added bonus, ACMA gets to pretend this is some kind of protection of your freedom,
since the state will not itself be doing the deleting â€” as if that makes any difference since they
set the rules.

This is not a joke.

The factsheet for this legislation includes "ACMA will not have the power to request specific
content or posts be removed from digital platform services" as an example of "strong
protections for privacy and freedom of speech".20

In reality there are no protections at all for your privacy or freedom of speech in this power
grab.

Here follows an example of how ACMA has previously been forced to act as an arbiter of
###### "truth" in current affairs programming due to industry codes of practice.

###### codes of practice

ACMA investigated a religious program that hosted a medical doctor who questioned the
covid gene-vaccines in September 2021.[21]

###### "We're seeing an uptick in the laboratory of reactivated other viruses; Epstein-Barr, herpes viruses, HPV viruses, we're seeing an uptick in certain cancers, already," said the doctor on subscription cable TV show Ministry Now.

ACMA investigated this statement and found it to be "not accurate" and a breach of the
###### industry code of practice on accuracy.[22]

ACMA didn't know whether it was accurate or not. It couldn't know. It was too soon in 2021 to
###### know if the gene-vaccines cause cancer. Studies take time to design, conduct, get accepted, peer reviewed and published.

How could anyone see whether the mRNA products cause cancers in a year, or even six
###### months, when both the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials destroyed their control group23 after just 2.5 months? There was nobody to compare it to.

 The best we could do was to have doctors sound the alarm over what they were seeing, which

is exactly what the doctor did on Ministry Now.

###### The broadcast licensee didn't provide ACMA with studies to prove the cancer risk, and ACMA couldn't find any. The product had been on the market for less than a year.

 Google censored search results in 2021 and 2022 making it difficult to find published studies
criticising the gene-vaccines. Google discredited the voices of scientists warning of its terrible
###### side-effects by elevating parody accounts that mocked them or spurious "factchecks" to smear

being emailed.

ACMA ruled the doctor's statement false and a breach of the code because it could find no
relevant evidence.

###### It made its decision on what it could find: an AP "fact check"26 (now removed) that
"debunked" a Natural News story about how mRNA gene-vaccines can cause cancer, claiming
###### it misrepresented a 2018 study. But this had no bearing on whether the doctor's claim was true or not.

Australian health authorities said the gene-vaccines were safe for cancer sufferers to use â€” but
this was irrelevant to the accuracy of the doctor's claim as there were no placebo-controlled
studies done on cancer sufferers to prove this.

Now you see the deadly danger of censorship.

ACMA ruled against the narrow-caster of the pay TV program even though it cannot know that
what the doctor said was "not accurate".

###### It has now been shown that the gene-vaccines can indeed activate cancers.

They have also been shown to reactivate latent viruses including herpes.

A peer-reviewed paper by Seneff et al from June 202227 reviews the medical literature. It
explains how the gene-vaccines downregulate critical pathways related to cancer surveillance
and infection control in the body leading to an increased risk of certain cancers and the
reactivation of viruses, including herpes.

ACMA cannot know the truth. Accurate science is not done by consensus. Therefore the only
safe answer when medical opinions differ is to let doctors be doctors, and air their thoughts
###### without censorship, deplatforming, persecution or demonisation.

ACMA cannot know what is true and therefore cannot set censorship rules. Big Tech

The landing page for this proposed legislation states the powers created are consistent with
the recommendations in ACMA's June 2021 report to government on the adequacy of digital
platforms' disinformation and news quality measures.[32]

To bolster this report, ACMA commissioned research from the University of Canberra's News
and Media Research Centre and from social media consultancy We Are Socia1.[33]

The University of Canberra research conducted a survey and interviewed focus groups about
###### their opinions and experiences of "misinformation" and "disinformation".

Where required participants were given the definitions provided by ACMA: 'Misinformation'
was defined as the inadvertent sharing of false information, while 'disinformation' was

states.

In other words, "misinformation" is simply being wrong online, while "disinformation" is lying.

The real problem then begins: how do you know what is true and what is wrong? How do you
know if someone is deliberately lying? Can you read their mind? Perhaps you are wrong.

The entire premise of this research is intrinsically subjective.

This is a problem of epistemology. It can't be solved by research such as this.

So the researchers were left with individuals describing things they thought were
misinformation. Again, highly subjective.

In the survey methodology for determining whether a person was "Covid-19 informed vs
###### misinformed", the researchers state:

"The questions addressing misinformation beliefs are designed to assess agreement with
###### official advice on a range of issues related to Covid-19 including mask wearing and
appropriate treatment ... Those who are in general disagreement with the authoritative or
###### factual advice are labelled as 'misinformed'. Of the five statements, if a respondent is in
disagreement with one or two health advice, they are categorised as 'misinformed (low)
(30%)'. If a respondent disagrees with three to five statements, they are recoded as
'misinformed (high) (11%)'. The rest was recoded as 'informed' (60%)" 35 (emphasis mine)

So there it is.

The assumption is there, underpinning the research, that what the Government says is "true"
and if you disagree with that then you are "misinformed".

ACMA recognised this in its June 2021 report to government, which made the key
recommendation that it wanted censorship powers.

On page 9, ACMA wrote:

"Similarly, those who rely on social media as their main source of news also reported higher
levels of exposure to COVID-19 misinformation than the general population .... This research
relies on respondents both knowing and accurately self-reporting on their level of exposure to
misinformation. To help address this limitation, the N&MRC also asked surveyed Australians to
respond to 5 claims about COVID-19 guidelines, prevention strategies and treatments (for
example, 'wearing a mask does not significantly reduce your risk of infection or spreading the
virus'). Those who agreed with official advice at the time for all 5 statements were

considered 'misinformed (low).

The University of Canberra report was bulked up with a quantitative analysis of where people
get their news. This provided lots of charts and graphs and percentages to provide the
impression of an objective, measurable, factual and scientific report. This camouflages the
dodgy and subjective part of the report, and helps ACMA to appear authoritative and
informed when making its case for censorship power.

These figures basically showed large numbers of people get their news from social media â€”
which is exactly why the government wants to control social media.

The second report that ACMA relied on to ask for more powers, is the We Are Social network
analysis, which ACMA provided to Letters From Australia in response to a media request.

This report is called: "Social media insights into how online misinformation and disinformation
are being spread across social platforms in Australia"

The assumptions are built right into the headline.

Researchers trawled the internet to find "misinformation" in order to count the mentions of
key words, quantify it into objective sounding percentages and authoritative graphs.

They decided on three "key narratives" that were "misinformation" to count: anti-lockdown +
Q-anon, anti-vaccine and anti-5G.37

Again, these categories are all incredibly subjective.

What is "anti-vaccine"? People whose whole careers were dedicated to making vaccines, such

as Canadian vaccinologist Byram Bridle, were labelled "anti-vaxxers" in 2021 and 2022
because they raised concerns over a rushed new class of product.

###### "Anti-lockdown" was lumped in with "Q-anon", as though people must be unhinged to oppose
the shut-down of the economy over a relatively mild virus that had a global infection fatality
rate of less than 0.03 percent for under-6Os, before vaccines, in its more virulent form.38

The assumptions are breathtaking.

This is junk science.

Here is a snip from page 24 to illustrate how "misinformation research" paints opinionated
and subjective judgements of other people's ideas as objectively quantifiable science. Pink

##### But is actually just demonlisation of government policy opponents

The most engaging pieces of content under the anti-vax narrative focused on the government's plan for
mandatory COVID-19 vaccines and the promotion of an 'inadeivately tested vaccine'.. This included a
meme post suggesting that readers should not put faith in a vaccine but in God, and a video falsely
alleging that 80% of people who tried a COVID-19 vaccine experienced systemic side effects. {~
##### guilt by association fallacy here

Notice how "anti-vax narrative" is here defined as being against the government's coerced
injections of gene-vaccines.

Notice how this misrepresents these people as being against all vaccines, which demonises
their position by exaggeration.

These products were bought by the government before testing was finished.39 They were
developed in less than a year despite being an entirely new class of drug with a novel
mechanism of action, even though the safety and manufacturing testing for traditional
vaccines ordinarily takes 10 to 15 years.

Notice the "guilt by association" fallacy which smears those with fact-based concerns about
###### the inadequate testing of the gene-vaccines with people who allegedly said put your faith in
God instead of a vaccine.

This report confuses opinion with "misinformation", such as the meme below (pink text is
mine).

The fact that this entire report is pseudoscience is not the fault of the researchers.

The entire class of "misinformation and disinformation" research is junk for the exact same
reason. The premise is wrong.

When given the remit by ACMA to go and quantify "misinformation" on the internet, the
researchers did their best.

But they cannot help but produce exactly what you see, because it's not possible to determine
what is true and what is not. It's a loaded judgement and always will be.

The government told Australians that an entirely new class of drug, a gene-vaccine that was
only ever provisionally registered by the TGA and rushed to market with barely any testing,
was safe and effective. It didn't work and it's so unsafe that thousands of Australians have
injuries and an unknown number have died.[4o]

ACMA now wants to censor "misinformation" and their own research clearly shows that they
consider disagreeing with whatever the official government advice is at the time to be
"misinformation".

Other than that, ACMA cannot actually define "misinformation", as they admit in their June
2021 report to government it is "constantly shifting" and there are "difficulties in assessing
falsehoods".

###### Misinformation by platform ACMA 2021 "Report to Government an the Adequacy of Digital
Platforms' Disinformation and News Quality Measures"p.17
Given the constantly shifting nature of misinformation, difficulties in assessing
###### falsehoods, and the challenges in accessing relevant data, it is not possible to quantify
the true scale and volume of misinformation in Australia. However, consumer surveys
and open-source network analysis can help provide insights into which platforms are
###### at higher risk and help provide a baseline for future assessments.

democratically elected representatives in Parliament.

ACMA's June 2021 report to government slandered Craig Kelly, at that time a sitting Member
###### of Parliament, as a misinformation superspreader for his brave advocacy for gene-vaccine
injured people. He lost his preselection and was kicked out of the Liberal Party.

###### It stated:

"1n our commissioned research, We Are Social compiled a list of the top 20 Australian
influencers sharing misinformation narratives, based on their total number of
interactions. Heading this list was celebrity chef Pete Evans, followed by Federal MP
Craig Kelly, and prominent anti-vaccine campaigner Taylor Winterstein." [41]

#### 3) This law will destroy the refuge of dissidents

The fact sheets published along with ACMA's June 2021 report reveal the true intent of this
legislation.

###### It's to destroy the last places online where dissidents could be heard.

During the pandemic, dissident doctors and scientists were censored, deplatformed and
persecuted by the state across the Anglosphere.

At the direct request of Australia's Department of Home Affairs42 and Department of Health[43][, ]

both Twitter and Facebook took down posts from gene-vaccine injured people looking for help
because they got in the way of the "safe and effective" gene-vaccine messaging campaign
already planned in November 2020.

###### the Pfizer gene-vaccine injured [her.]

 Twitter (pre-Elon Musk) turned down the visibility on Stanford University professor of medicine Jay Bhattacharya in 2020 and 2021 so his messages would never catch on and trend

â€” so you wouldn't read them.[46]

###### That's because he co-authored the 2020 Great Barrington Declaration with Harvard University professor of medicine Martin Kulldorff and Oxford University epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta to warn the world that the the best covid strategy was not lockdowns at all but to protect the elderly (who had a thousand-fold higher death risk) while allowing the young to develop herd immunity from natural infection.

 Not even the medical professors and elected representatives could share true information that challenged the enforced state covid propaganda on Twitter, Google and Facebook - and not just in Australia but in New Zealand, the US, the UK and Canada.

YouTube (owned by Google) would take down the true stories of gene-vaccine injured
###### people almost immediately.47

 Corporate media houses refused to print the stories that went against government covid policy. They ignored the voices of gene-vaccine injured people and when they mentioned them, they were demonised as "cookers" and "anti-vaxxers", or their injuries were represented without evidence as being "extremely rare".

So dissidents found refuge in smaller sites.

Substack became a home for real journalism. Rumble and Bitchute were the free speech
###### alternatives to YouTube. Scientists and doctors and gene-vaccine injured people could talk about what was happening there.

 But ACMA does not want these corners of respite to exist at all.

The purpose of this new law is to crush the dissidents on these places, too, so there is
###### nowhere for them to share their stories on the internet at all.

This can be seen in Fact Sheet 3 that accompanied ACMA's June 2021 report to

complained that "conspiratorial communities" could seek out alternative platforms to
avoid moderation (censorship) and that because their codes of practise were voluntary
###### platforms could ignore them.

They want the power to force all platforms to censor for them.

They wrote:

"The ACMA recommended The ACMA recommended that government should provide it
###### with reserve powers to register industry codes, enforce industry code compliance and make
standards relating to the activities of digital platforms. These powers would provide a
mechanism for further intervention if code administration arrangements prove inadequate,
###### or the voluntary industry code fails. The government has accepted this recommendation. ["4s ]

They even created a "Misinformation and Disinformation Action Group" to expedite their
censorship drive.

Thanks to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter and the excellent journalism of Matt Taibbi and

a team of investigative reporters at Racket News, the public learnt that the mass
censorship of social media over the last three years was at the direct request of the US
###### security state, its five-eyes allies (including Australia) and a linked network of more than 50
agencies, foundations and university-linked think tanks that draw funding to promote the
censorship-industrial complex.49

This censorship was so shocking to the American people, who have a constitutionally-
protected right to free speech, that a court case was launched which resulted in an
extraordinary ruling on July 4 temporarily banning the FBI and Biden Administration officials
###### from even contacting social media firms for the purpose of censorship that would infringe on
the First Amendment free speech rights of Americans.[50]

Australia has no free speech protections in law at all other than a weak implied right to
political communication in the constitution.

But if this legislation goes through, the Big Tech platforms may apply these "misinformation"
censorship codes internationally, across their operations, including in the US and Canada and
New Zealand - giving the US security state everything it wanted and pressured them for and

```
   5) IN CONCLUSION:

###### â€¢ "Misinformation and disinformation" is a fake problem, small in scope. Wrong information on the internet is not a big threat to Australians

 â€¢ A sinister danger is instead posed by state control of information and government policies that cannot be challenged by loud and uncontrolled dissent

 â€¢ Our safety and wellbeing is guaranteed only by a robust marketplace of ideas where people are able to be heard, even when they are wrong

 â€¢ A parasitic industry of fake "misinformation and disinformation" experts has been created to justify censorship. There is no qualification that enables "experts" to identify wrong information in a way that we are not able to

 â€¢ This legislation assumes that ACMA, an arm of the state, is able to determine what is "untrue, misleading or deceitful" (misinformation) when they have no such ability.
```
ACMA doesn't know what is true. It therefore cannot preside over misinformation
codes of practise

###### â€¢ Several examples of "dangerous misinformation" that ACMA used to lobby for these powers turned out later to be factually accurate, or just different opinions that challenged government messaging

 â€¢ This legislation is a power grab by an unelected bureaucracy that would get to decide what "misinformation" is for all of us and ban it, strangling our democracy

 â€¢ Under this legislation ACMA would set the censorship rules, called "misinformation industry codes" but outsource the implementation to Big Tech corporations. This allows the state to hide behind corporate partners in order to pretend that they are not
censoring. The technical definition of corporate-state combines is "fascism"

###### â€¢ ACMA are the ones with the final say on the "misinformation and disinformation codes of practice" under this legislation, which they would have the power to enforce

 â€¢ Unelected bureaucrats including former police officers and security state operatives at
ACMA would determine "truth" for the whole country: what can be seen, heard or
###### written about online. Whatever they don't like would be censored as "misinformation"


-----

###### "misinformation" back to ACMA. This inflates ACMA's importance so they can traffic in
analysis and ask for even more money, power, people and research to "solve" the fake
###### problem that they themselves created

 â€¢ ACMA, an unelected bureau, would have the power to create legislative instruments, making its own rules and sidelining our elected legislators

 â€¢ This legislation will crush dissident voices from alternative media where they found refuge during the covid pandemic. This is deliberate.

 â€¢ This legislation exempts "professional news" which is not defined, but includes the compliant corporate media houses that heavily censored content during the pandemic. It is not possible for media to be free and adversarial if it has to partner with and be
recognised by the state in order to publish. This is the manner in which North Korea
###### permits KCNA to publish as "professional news". Freedom is guaranteed by diverse and chaotic voices that the government can't control by registration, industry standards or the centralised ownership of a few big players

 â€¢ This legislation will back-engineer censorship to the (already compliant) corporate media outlets such as Daily Mail, Nine Newspapers or News.com.au which need social media shares and Google search visibility for audience and revenue sharing. Journalists who might otherwise refuse overt state censorship will be manipulated by incentives to comply with "industry standards"

 â€¢ Australia already has laws to deal with criminal behaviour such as incitement to violence, fraud and child porn. Criminal acts are a matter for the police using the extensive powers they already have. New censorship rules are not needed

 â€¢ This legislation carries no protection for free speech at all, despite the Department dishonestly claiming to do so by not giving ACMA the power to request specific posts be removed. ACMA doesn't want or need to micromanage because the platforms are forced to do it for them.

 â€¢ ACMA and the Federal Government should have exactly zero say in censoring the voices of Australians even when they are wrong or misinformed

This legislation cannot be allowed to pass in any form.
