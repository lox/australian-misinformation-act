This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective.
What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It is
simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This proposed bill
is an extreme version of this. I once believed that we lived in a free country, but not anymore.

It must be rejected.
