Dear Minister for Communica�ons,

This is a submission regarding the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng
Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.

While the proposed Misinforma�on Bill aims to address a serious and growing concern of
misinforma�on and disinforma�on in digital pla�orms, there are several arguments against its
implementa�on. These concerns revolve around poten�al governmental overreach, infringement of
privacy, limita�ons on free speech, and the challenges of determining what cons�tutes
misinforma�on.

Government Overreach: Gran�ng the government reserve powers to intervene if industry efforts
are deemed inadequate can lead to poten�al abuse of power. Governments might misuse these
powers to s�fle dissen�ng voices, curtail poli�cal opposi�on, or limit the flow of informa�on that
challenges their narra�ve. This could undermine the principles of democracy and open discourse.

Privacy Concerns: Allowing the government to gather informa�on from digital pla�orm providers
or require them to keep specific records about misinforma�on and disinforma�on raises significant
privacy concerns. This approach could lead to the mass collec�on of personal data, poten�ally
infringing upon individuals' rights to privacy and data protec�on.

Limits on Free Speech: While the bill claims not to grant the government the power to request
specific content removal, the line between comba�ng misinforma�on and censoring legi�mate
speech can be blurry. The poten�al for self-censorship could grow as digital pla�orms try to avoid
government interven�on, resul�ng in a chilling effect on free speech and open dialogue.

Subjec�vity and Ambiguity: Defining misinforma�on and disinforma�on is complex and o�en
subjec�ve. What cons�tutes "false, misleading, or decep�ve" content can vary depending on
perspec�ves and contexts. Deciding what qualifies as "serious harm" and whether content
"undermines the integrity of an Australian democra�c process" can be challenging and open to
interpreta�on, poten�ally leading to inconsistent enforcement.

Unintended Consequences: Enforcing strict industry codes of prac�ce might encourage pla�orms
to implement automated content filtering systems, which could inadvertently remove legi�mate
content, thereby hindering open discourse. Addi�onally, the crea�on and enforcement of industry
standards might lead to a s�fling of innova�on, as pla�orms might priori�ze compliance over user
experience.

Shi� of Responsibility: Placing the primary responsibility on the government to combat
misinforma�on and disinforma�on could lead to complacency within the industry. Instead of relying
on a collabora�ve effort between pla�orms, governments, and users, the bill might inadvertently
create a culture where pla�orms expect the government to handle these issues without their ac�ve
involvement.

Dynamic Nature of Informa�on: Misinforma�on and disinforma�on tac�cs are constantly evolving.
Government regula�ons might struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape of online
content and communica�on methods. This could result in ineffec�ve regula�ons that are easily
circumvented by those spreading misinforma�on.

Interna�onal Precedents: Similar atempts to regulate online content and combat misinforma�on
in other countries have faced cri�cism for enabling censorship, restric�ng free speech, and

suppressing dissent. Lessons from these precedents should be taken into account when cra�ing new
regula�ons.

In conclusion, while the intent of the proposed Misinforma�on Bill is to address a genuine concern,
its implementa�on could lead to unintended consequences that undermine free speech, privacy, and
democra�c values. A more balanced approach that encourages collabora�on between government,
industry, and civil society may be a more effec�ve way to address the complex challenges posed by
misinforma�on and disinforma�on in the digital age.

For Your Considera�on

Sincerely

A Concerned Australian
