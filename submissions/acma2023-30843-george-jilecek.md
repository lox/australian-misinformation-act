Dear Sir/ Madam, August 14, 2023

It is only logical that any form of censorship prevents debate needed to find the
best possible solution to all subjects.
In an experience of past 3 years many mistakes have been made.

With an open discussion it could have been prevented.

I sincerely oppose any form of censorship .

Kind Regards

George Jilecek
