Melbourne, August 19th 2013

Dear Sir/Madam,

As an Australian citizen and retired academic, I write to inform you that I do not support any
censorship in Australia and wholly oppose the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I absolutely oppose any laws which would empower the Australian Communications and
Media Authority or any other Australian body to restrict in any way our right to communicate
freely and openly on any issue of relevance to Australian society.

In my opinion, the proposed legislation would constitute a neo-authoritarian regressive step
in the history of Australiaâ€™s liberal democracy.

Best regards,
