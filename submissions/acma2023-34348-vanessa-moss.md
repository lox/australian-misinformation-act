This “proposed” bill is another ‘power grab’ and a ‘fundamental threat to our democracy.
This bill is an extraordinary example of government overreach and, if this bill goes through,
public health safety, electoral integrity, social cohesion and ultimately democracy will be at
risk. It will allow the government to manage Australians like little children. It will enable
them to hide their mistakes, incompetence, criminality and corruption. We know just how
ineffective the government is at providing factual information. For example information
relating to COVID-19 and their vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic taught us not to trust
the government, our medical practitioners (thanks to AHPRA’s statement to their
members), or our media, as misinformation/ disinformation provided by the government
about COVID treatments led to serious consequences (the public were not fully informed
of the possible adverse events which meant that the government violated voluntary
informed consent). We are now experiencing unprecedented excess death rates (16-20%
above the 5 year average) which are being ignored by the government and the media.
These government officials who can’t use spell check or safety test dangerously rushed
gene-vaccines want to control everything we can see, hear or say online. That many
claims made by politicians and health authorities turned out to be false would seem to be a
problem. For example, Australians were told in 2021 that they were confronting a uniquely
deadly virus that required an extreme response. The Australian Bureau of Statistics,
however, recorded that 2021 was the second lowest level of respiratory deaths since
records have been kept (the lowest was 2020). They also said they won’t block political
speech but a politician’s maiden speech to parliament was banned from YouTube in June,
2023     - Liberal Democrats MLC John Ruddick     - who called into question the risky
experimental gene-based vaccines. A first in Australian history! (It has since been
reinstated.)

This bill will give ACMA (Australian Communications & Media Authority) extraordinary
powers and have a chilling effect on, and would suppress legitimate, free speech. In
classic double speak Michelle Rowland said ACMA will be given its new information
gathering and record-keeping powers “while balancing the right to freedom of expression
so fundamental to democracy”     - they will be stopping freedom of expression to protect
freedom of expression! They will outsource censorship to the digital platforms so the
government can dishonestly pretend that it is not the one ordering the censoring. It’s
decentralised censorship. Also, the Australian public will not be able to vote ACMA in or
out, so they will not care if we like it or not.

After reading through the bill there are huge problems:

       - It will stifle political debate       - the definition of ‘misinformation’ is too broad.

       - Nothing a government official, an ‘approved’ academic or news media representative
says can be misinformation/disinformation, but criticisms or statements by somebody
disagreeing with government official, an ‘approved’ academic or news media
representative can be deemed misinformation/disinformation.

       - It will allow all levels of government to become a ‘ministry of truth’ censor of social
media companies.

       - Professional news content       - who defines this?


-----

       - Content that is authorised by the Commonwealth or the State       - a backdoor so
Canberra can lie to the Australian people without consequences.

       - How do you establish a person’s intent from a post, and, how will ACMA know how the
reader will respond?

Why exclude the government and government entities, government approved media and
online news media content and government approved accredited educational providers?
Research has shown that the government, news media and educational institutions can
also be a source of harmful misinformation and disinformation (such as the 2019 election
reports about the ‘death tax’). The fact that the bill explicitly exempts any government
communication, or any level of government, from being considered misinformation or
disinformation, shows how Orwellian this law will be.

This bill will be a direct violation of Section 16 of the Human Rights Act 2004 which states
that:

1. Everyone has the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes the freedom to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of borders,
whether orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or any other way chosen by him
or her.

and in direct violation of the UN General Assembly’s ‘International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights’ (ICCPR) on 16 December 1966:
ICCPR Article 19 states     -
1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,
either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his
choice.

General Comment 34 emphasises that freedom of expression and opinion are the
foundation stone of a free and democratic society and a necessary condition for the
promotion and protection of human rights.

The government are already using “misinformation” to threaten journalists right now. The
Department of Health accused Alison Bevege of false and misleading information when
she stated that the COVID products were gene vaccines. It’s obvious and factual: both the
mRNA products (Pfizer and Moderna), and the DNA products (Astra Zeneca...quietly
withdrawn from the market 12 months after UK withdrew it due to the high number of
adverse events), insert a genetic sequence into your cells instructing them to express an
uncontrollable amount of non-human spike protein from the COVID-19 virus. These
products are nothing like traditional vaccines which are simple doses of weakened or killed
virus injected to provoke an immune response. The government named these products
“vaccines” to confuse the public because people would readily accept them without fuss,
thus helping the government achieve their policy goal. The government was completely
wrong about the COVID-19 “vaccines”. They did not reduce transmission. They were not
safe; they injured people.

Australia is one of the few common law countries to not have a Constitutional Charter or
Bill of Rights. However, the High Court has held that an implied freedom of political
communication exists as an indispensable part of the system of representative and
responsible government created by the Constitution. It operates as a freedom from
government restraint, rather than a right conferred directly on individuals. It is my belief
that the recently appointed has just been appointed the^^^^^^^^M

nd who has been described as

the most radical, hard-left activist the bench has ever seen has come to
further erode our legal rights and make a mockery of our legal system. He is one of the
engineers behind what is going on.

I fear the government will do anything to suppress dissent... isn’t “deceiving the public” the
same as “misinformation and disinformation”? This bill will enforce a regime of
suppression of any speech on social media that undermines government claims (as we
witnessed in the mass-censorship of contrary analysis relating to COVID-19, **including** **of**
**qualified** **doctors** **and** **scientists.**

ACMA cannot determine what is untrue, misleading or deceitful (misinformation) when
they have no such capability. This department therefore should not enforce
misinformation and disinformation codes of practice.

Instead of a censorship bill Australia needs a First Amendment to protect free speech
rights for every Australian. That first right protects all the others. Nobody has a monopoly
on truth!

To state the obvious, once people get past about 8 years old, they develop minds of their
own and will come to very different conclusions about what they read, including the ability
to move past what doesn’t interest them. It’s not up to the government to be the arbiter of
truth, it’s up to the government to be transparent and accountable, an approach they have
moved away from for many years, but particularly in the last 3 years. All levels of
government appear to be suppressing, not protecting, democracy.

**DEMOCRACY:** **(State** **having)** **government** **by** **all** **the** **people,** **direct** **or** **representative;**
**form** **of** **society** **ignoring** **hereditary** **class** **distinctions** **and** **tolerating** **minority** **views.**
