Letter to the Australian Government opposing the ‘Misinformation and Disinformation’ Bill
2023.

Dear Members of the Australian Government,

I am writing to oppose the introduction of the ‘Misinformation and Disinformation’ Bill of
2023. There are many problems with the Bill which I would like to highlight. Firstly, it is an
attack on freedom of speech that is inconsistent with Australia’s international human rights
obligations and the Bill enables government bureaucrats and big tech to silence and censor
speech that goes far beyond reasonable limitation. The Bill will give government the power
to silence religious and political speech that contradicts prevailing ideologies and political
messaging. The Bill fails to include mechanisms to protect valid expression of opinion and
belief or to ensure that there are clear and defined limits on suppression of speech. The Bill
includes a vague and ideological definition of “harm” which risks it being weaponised to shut
down legitimate speech on pressing social issues. The Bill does not require mechanisms that
will hold digital service providers liable for excessive and onerous policing of legitimate
speech.
The exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime is hypocritical
and inconsistent and will establish an asymmetry that results in one rule for government and
another rule for Australians in what they can say. The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to
compel owners and private users of digital platforms to provide information and evidence
about misinformation and disinformation that is a worrying breach of privacy. The Bill does
not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of censorship
powers.
The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to freedom
of expression are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for
the interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.
The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and
standards and for failing to provide evidence requested by ACMA is excessive and will
provide a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.

Please oppose this very problematic Bill.

Sincerely,
