I do not support the proposed legislation.
There is currently an imbalance of information covered by mainstream media. For example there is totally inadequate information
on issues against the voice referendum. I am forced to search on social media for other viewpoints. It is clear to me that these
YouTube presentations are contrary to the government's desires, and that all such presentations could be wiped if the bill is
passed.
Who decides what is misinformation, or disinformation. Is there anyone reading this who put their entire wealth on a bet that our
indigenous peoples will have lives on par with the rest of the Australian community if the voice is passed? If not is the case for the
referendum misinformation? As persons speaking against the voice are demonized even by mainstream media, I conclude the
powers to be consider the argument for the voice to be absolute truth but that I am entitled to read any other information on
social media and further that if this bill is passed that any argument against the voice would subsequently be censored.
I could repeat the above concerns in relation to Covid 19, or Woke & gender affirmations.
The bill is a step towards totalitarianism and it must not pass.
There are already adequate laws to prevent harmful activity on social media. There are laws against inciting violence, and I agree
that such "information" should be reported to the police and taken down. Uploading information that deforms a person's
character on social media can lead to being sued by that person. There is alread adequate protection against abuse of social
media.
I note that there is a vast amount of misinformation and disinformation on YouTube. Unlike contrary information regarding Covid
lockdowns, the jab etc. which were all removed by Google, conspiracies such as NASA withholding information on Niberu,
(some fictional planet) which was going to collide with earth was not removed. Nor was the waffle regarding the end of the world
to occur on 12 December 2012 because that was where the Mayan calendar ended removed. Nor was the garbage about the
Earth's rotation about the Sun being an illusion taken down. Only selected information is taken down. Who decides? Google
seems to have its own agenda. What agenda does a parliament have? That's the problem with the bill.
Please vote against the suject bill.
