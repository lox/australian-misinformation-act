I am against the ACMA introducing new legislation to stop the spread of ‘mis and dis-information on
social media’ and hate Speech. We are not children and do not need the government deciding what
is and isn’t the right information. The truth is there is no such thing as a balance of free speech.
Speech is either free or it isn’t. If there is a Nazi out there, I want to know who they are, so no
government should ever force them underground. Let them show themselves. Government
controlling media is not democracy.
