The proposed 2023 Communications Legislation Amendment, Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation, henceforth ‘the Bill’, represents at best a dangerously ill-conceived, presumptuous
and paternalistic attempt to undermine Australians’ freedom of expression. While the road to hell
is said to be paved with good intentions, the vagueness of the Bill’s definitions relevant to
establishing its scope and applicability, the incoherence of the specious arguments used to
articulate its purpose, and the consequent scope for its arbitrary abuse, not even that can be said
of this newly proposed route to perdition.

The Bill defines misinformation as _‘content that is false, misleading or deceptive, that is created_
_without an intent to deceive, but can cause and contribute to serious harm’. Disinformation is_
_‘misinformation that is disseminated with the intent deceive’. It would not be difficult to write a_
lengthy tome in an attempt to do justice to the problems with these definitions and the legislative
interventions they undergird. However, such an effort would require one to labour under the belief
that the proposed legislation has been drafted in good faith, and that its apparent flaws are not
features. For these reasons, I provide below but a sketch of the reasons why the Bill is
objectionable to anyone with an interest in the freedom of thought, expression and the pursuit of
truth.

1. **Breadth: the definition of misinformation places no philosophical or practical limits on what**
may  be classified as such, with the implicit exception of proclamations by governments,
corporate news outlets, or accredited educational institutions to which the provisions of the
Bill do not apply. With the possible exception of scientific laws, hypotheses that have yet to be
falsified, it is difficult to conceive of information that, in the absence of an agreed and clearly
explicated standard of truth, could not be deemed misinformation under the provisions of the
Bill. Anyone thinking that some standard of common sense or reasonableness may be relied
upon to prevail should bear in mind that we live in an age where the mere mention of
objectively demonstrable sexual dimorphism is deemed harmful to some.

2. **Presumption: implicit in the bill is the presumption that unelected tech platform providers,**
politicians and government bureaucrats are better able to discern misinformation from truth
than the population at large. Not only is there a presumption of omniscience, but benevolence
too. With this Bill, the government seeks to assume the role of a doting parent protecting a
toddler from the perils of an unguarded electrical outlet. Seen this way, the Bill is nothing short
of a loving and protective embrace, without which the casualty departments would be overrun
by the innocent and naive who’d obediently injected themselves with bleach upon heeding
the medical speculations of a fellow (albeit American) politician. This flippant hypothetical,
cited as an imbecilic example in the ‘fact sheet’ explaining the rationale of the Bill reflects both
the contempt with which the public are regarded, and the ignorance of history required to
accept the notion that governments, corporate media and accredited educational providers
are not themselves the most dangerous purveyors of misinformation and disinformation. From
the healthy eating pyramid, to the lies justifying the invasion of Iraq, to dangerous and
unsubstantiated claims about the coronavirus ‘vaccine’ efficacy and the perils of Ivermectin,
the examples of government misinformation and disinformation, promulgated unquestioningly
by corporate media and tech platform providers, the examples are legion. Benito Mussolini
declared that _‘Fascism should rightly be called corporatism as it is a merge of state and_
_corporate power.’_ The Bill can thus be thought of as a legal enshrinement of fascism in
Australia.

3. **Reason: whether one approaches from a philosophical, economic, or scientific line of**
thinking, the Bill is contrary to reason. Living in an age and culture steeped in scientism, the
scientific method itself has been misrepresented, misunderstood and corrupted for political
ends: a claim that is borne out ever time one hears politicians, technology wonks, media or

bureaucrats (arbiters of truth under the Bill) make appeals to ‘consensus science’, or claims
along the lines that ’98% of scientists agree that [insert talking point]’. Michael Crichton
summed it succinctly: ‘Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with
_consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one_
_investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable_
_by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is_
_reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke_
_with the consensus.’_ Ignác Fülöp Semmelweiss, the Hungarian physician who revealed the
links between mortality rates from puerperal fever and hand-washing in obstetrical clinics,
died in a mental asylum following protracted conflict with the medical establishment at the
time. Closer to home, the Australian scientist Barry Marshall was awarded the 2005 Nobel
prize for physiology and medicine for overturning the established medical orthodoxy in
identifying a causal link between bacteria and stomach ulcers. Such was the resistance to this
apparent ‘misinformation’, that Dr Marshall resorted to infecting himself with the bacteria
causing the severe gastric illness to make his point. The point more generally is eloquently
made by Richard Feynman: ‘It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of
_uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction_
_that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various_
_periods in the history of man.’_ The anti-scientific strictures of the Bill lay the foundations, at
best, for apathy and stagnation. Even economics, the most dismal of sciences, suggests that
the Bill should not be countenanced for at least two reasons. First, the asymmetry of
information, and the divergence of incentives between the voting public (principals) and their
self-appointed protectors (agents) provide compelling a-priori reasons to believe that the
powers conferred by the Bill will be abused. Second, there is no benefit in argued principle or
historical experience, to be gained from incurring the demonstrable risks of the legislative
intervention.

I close with the observation that, while a multiplicity of objections can be made on the important
but ultimately prosaic grounds of history, science and economics, the Bill threatens the most
fundamental of human quests, the purpose for which we were created: the freedom to explore,
discern and assert beliefs about questions beyond the reach of the scientific method, the
Orwellian deliberations of “fact checkers” or the shallow, self-serving bleating of the majority of
our elected representatives. Facebook, YouTube and similar platforms routinely suspend, band or
demonetise users who share Christian imagery, prayers and doctrines - the most fundamental and
important of truths that provide, meaning purpose and freedom to countless millions. Viewed in
this light, it’s not difficult to understand the nature of the threat being addressed by the Bill. I
strongly urge the rejection of this most dangerous of legislative impositions on the fundamental
rights and freedoms of Australians.
