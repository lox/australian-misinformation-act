Dear Senator/Member of Parliament

Bailouts, bail-in, selling Australia, deregulation, dis-empowering of regulators, ceding of
sovereignty, Dangerous Allies, colonial oppression, demonisation of best trading partner, escalation
of war talk and preparation, and the list goes on. Now an act on par with book burning.
Parliamentarians, we are on a deadly path.

_Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a_
_king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear_
_witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”_
_Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and_
_said to them, “I find no fault in Him at all._
John 18:37-38 (New King James Version)

You and I are not judges of the truth. We are near and far from it throughout our lives, but we do not
grasp it for our whole lives. One day you will come face to face with The Truth. Will you count
yourself worthy of our Lord’s company if you realise that along with the lies you have suppressed
you have suppressed the truth?

_“And remember that within every lie, there is a truth hidden. Know the truth to defeat the lie.”_

T. A. Miles, Raventide (2011)

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023 will not be the last perversion from those controlling the narratives on economics,
government, kingdom and faith. More will come. They will continue to disguise their lies as selfevident truths.

Will you (continue to?) follow the sophistry or will you stand?

Yours Faithfully,

Andrew Soulos
