Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this submission to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an
Australian citizen and a firm believer in the importance of freedom of speech, I find it highly distressing that
the Australian Government would introduce a bill that undermines this fundamental right.

Firstly, the existence of this bill indicates a lack of respect for the freedom of speech of Australian citizens.
By creating two classes of citizens, with certain privileged groups having the power to spread potentially
false or misleading information online, while regular citizens are subject to excessive fines for expressing
their opinions, the bill clearly discriminates against the majority of our democracy. It unjustly restricts the
voice and influence of regular people, who often possess a wealth of knowledge on various topics,
including industry insights.

The internet, in my strongly held belief, is the most powerful democratic invention in human history as it has
given a voice to regular people. This law poses a significant risk to the empowerment of ordinary citizens,
disproportionately harming the very individuals it should protect and serve.

Moreover, the proposed legislation's strict fines will undoubtedly lead to digital service providers adopting
more restrictive speech policies, surpassing even the most stringent regulations currently in place. The lack
of "pressure escape valves" within the system further compounds the harm caused by this bill. It is
essential to acknowledge that accurately judging the veracity of information is an impossible task, as new
discoveries often contradict previously accepted facts.

For instance, there have been numerous instances where authorities and expert consensus have provided
misleading information. The examples of false claims related to COVID-19, such as the effectiveness of
masks, human-to-human transmission, and vaccine-related aspects, demonstrate the challenges in
determining what constitutes misinformation. Allowing an industry code or a mandatory code created by
ACMA to dictate content removal would potentially suppress essential discussions and hinder the pursuit of
truth through open and honest debates.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has expressed serious
concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His statements on Twitter highlight the difficulty in
implementing legislation that can easily levy fines on questionable grounds. If an expert of Dr. Coatsworth's
caliber raises such issues, it raises doubts about the bill's objective alignment with truth-seeking rather than
censorship.

The proposed bill also grants excessive influence to industry bodies, which are often shaped and funded by
the largest players within a specific industry. This may create an environment where industry codes become

considering that the largest digital services can write their own regulations, while penalizing smaller
competitors with onerous requirements.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the free-market competition between platforms in addressing
misinformation and disinformation has proven effective. Social media networks such as Mastodon and
emerging Twitter competitors like BlueSky, Post.news, and Instagram Threads have gained momentum due
to public dissatisfaction with the misinfo/disinfo policies and enforcement on Twitter. This demonstrates that
users naturally gravitate towards platforms that align with their expectations, promoting competition and
variety.

It is also troubling that the proposed bill primarily focuses on larger platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and
Twitter, while inadvertently subjecting numerous community websites to its broad regulations. The failure to
consider the impact on smaller platforms and the potential eradication of small websites due to compliance
difficulties contradicts the efforts of competition regulators worldwide to reduce barriers to entry for digital
service competitors.

The impact on freedom, liberty, and the right to freedom of speech and enterprise is concerning. The bill's
broad nature, akin to setting a speed limit without providing information on it, places undue legal risks on
individuals and companies who may unknowingly be in violation. It raises questions about whether foreign
website owners would face fines or restrictions while accessing or operating within Australia. It is also vital
to consider the potential consequences for the decentralization and open-source principles of platforms like
Mastodon and their ability to comply with Australian industry codes.

Additionally, the proposed bill raises constitutional concerns regarding the abdication of legislative power to
private entities that are not directly accountable to Parliament. Delegating legislative authority to companies
through Misinformation Codes undermines the principles of democratic governance and the responsibility of
ministers to the Parliament. The power granted to ACMA further violates the implied constitutional freedom
of political communication, as limitations on legitimate discussions about matters of public policy and
scientific investigations hinder the free exchange of ideas.

The bill's assumption that government and accredited institutions can determine absolute truth without
considering the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians is deeply problematic. It undermines
diversity of perspectives and ignores the essential role of ordinary people in sense-making and
decision-making processes. Silencing viewpoints arbitrarily and categorizing them as misinformation or
disinformation undermines the principles of democracy and undermines trust in public discourse.

Moreover, the threats imposed on digital platform providers and regular users further disempower
individuals and stifle open discussions. The potential reputational damage, financial penalties, and
administrative burdens imposed on platform providers can have severe consequences for their operations.
Simultaneously, the threat of being summoned before ACMA places significant stress on individuals,
interferes with their personal lives, and disrupts the values of trust and camaraderie that are fundamental to
our society.

Furthermore, this legislation jeopardizes the democratic process by hindering access to vital information
necessary for informed voting decisions. The categorization of political party viewpoints as misinformation
to be removed from digital platforms reduces transparency and limits the diversity of perspectives available
to voters. Independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers will face undue pressure and
reputational harm, effectively suppressing competition and independent thought.

In conclusion, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, as currently proposed, poses a grave threat to freedom of speech, enterprise, and

discard this bill, or at the very least, undergo significant revisions that address the concerns raised in this
submission.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that my feedback will be given due consideration.

Yours sincerely,
