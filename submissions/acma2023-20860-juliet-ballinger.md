Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023

Thank you for the opportunity to speak regarding the above Amendment.

In perusing the Exposure Draft, Section 7 (1) and (2), both misinformation and
disinformation content is defined as “the content contains information that is false,
misleading or deceptive”. However, there is no standard against which false,
misleading or deceptive may be measured.

Australians have a great range of views, opinions and convictions on many matters.
What may be viewed as true and correct by one group is not necessarily viewed by
another group of people in the same way. Personal preference influences how people
think. Does the fact that an issue evokes many differing opinions necessarily require
that some views are false, misleading and deceptive while others are not? What is the
standard of measure for this? How can personal preference be regulated? The limiting
of information on a digital service according to a vague measure of ‘false, misleading
or deceptive’ without a standard is not based in truth or facts, but is at the whim of one
opinion or personal preference of a few individuals.

This Amendment is a restriction on free speech and free expression and does not
belong in a modern democracy like Australia. I am opposed to it in the strongest
possible terms.

Mrs Juliet Ballinger
