The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia

House of Representatives / The Senate

REF: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 – Exposure Draft

I do NOT AGREE to the proposed draft bill to limit free speech, free thought or to allow the
government to decide what is misinformation, disinformation or fake news or what online platforms
may communicate to the Australian public.

The ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) has a duty of care to the Australian
people to always provide true and factual information, however it is my understanding that they do
not provide truthful and honest factual information in regard to the health and safety of media
communications and the systems by which they are delivered. Giving the government, through the
ACMA, the power to decide what is correct information is giving power to a misguided and devious
agency.

My expertise lies in the field of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) and Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)
Testing and the resulting health effects, and I am concerned that the truth about EMF and EMR and
many other issues affecting the health, livelihood and safety of the people of Australia would be
silenced if this bill were to be adopted into the Australian Parliament and made law. This would be a
travesty of justice of enormous proportions.

We, being the people affected by unnaturally high levels of electromagnetic radiation in the form of
wireless radiation known as Wi-Fi and radiofrequency radiation from telephone
radiocommunications towers, are already subject to high levels of radiation, causing health effects
that are devastating. The government has already failed to protect the most vulnerable, our children
and those with immune compromised conditions from the rollout of more technology in the form of
smart devices and more radiofrequencies on the radiofrequency spectrum. Those that are affected
by bioaccumulation of radio frequencies like me, are not supported or acknowledged in any form
even though we are greatly affected and have lost our freedom to live a normal life. Losing the ability
to communicate the truth about this problem along with many other problems or issues that the
government wants covered up would give them total control and remove the ability for people to

have a voice to present the truth. This is just one example of the government not supporting the
people, instead they support the telecommunications industry at enormous cost to the people.

I definitely do not agree or consent to allowing the government to gain the power to decide what is
‘misinformation ‘.

All sides of a situation, or position must be allowed to be aired on public platforms without
discrimination by government agencies or appointed authorities or allowing government selfappointed (so called) experts that end up being the only spokesperson on a matter.

This Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 is not a solution to misinformation, fake news or misleading and deceptive information online,
it is a way to silence those that wish to present the truth.

**I do not consent to this bill being passed into law.**

Yours faithfully,
