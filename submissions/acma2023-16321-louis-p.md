# Submission to ACMA 3.7.2023 Have your Say – ACMA POWERS

I oppose the Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.  I oppose the Government or ACMA increasing their powers to reduce or
eliminate free speech from the Digital Platforms.  ACMA or the Government should not be in a
position to determine what is "Truth" or Misinformation/Disinformation without open debate.

Governments have been known to both be mistaken and to deliberately lie to the public to control
public discourse rather than allow individual freedoms and healthy debate.

This is a dangerous & draconian precedent and an attack on our democracy.

Trying to shutting down uncomfortable voices of dissent robs us of a valuable point of view that
should be debated and rationally put aside if “wrong” or “considered if possibly “correct”.

We have seen that a Governments deny “truth” and then later, the real truth comes out.

The USA and Australian Government denied that COVID 19 Leaked from a laboratory in
China. Now the FBI acknowledges that this is the likely case.

Human impact on the Climate is presented by the Government as “truth” or established
science, however there are many eminent scientists that disagree.  These scientists appear
to have been silenced and are considered to be delivering misinformation rather than
stimulating a healthy debate. Two examples of many are listed below:

      - Dr Patrick Moore – Founder of Greenpeace

      - Dr Judith Curry – Client Change Scientists – Former Chair of School of Earth and
Atmospheric Sciences the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Thalidamide was initially considered safe. If Thalidamide had been introduced today, any
denial that this drug could cause child birth defects would be considered “Misinformation”
until the evidence presented itself.  Under this Bill ACMA would be trying to shut down this
“misinformation” which would prevent further analysis and enquiry.

I fear that this Bill would be a first and significant step to the establishing and
Authoritarian/Totalitarian Government in Australia.

It is our responsibility to debate opinion – not shut it down Free Speech as is done in China and
Russia.
