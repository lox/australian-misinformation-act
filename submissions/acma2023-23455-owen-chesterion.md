To Whom it may concern,

I am wrifing to express my grave concerns regarding the proposed powers to combat misinformafion
and disinformafion.

The truth is not always clear, not always obvious and not always easily found.

The ability for everyone to discuss, debate and make up our own opinions is crucial for a wellfuncfioning society.

Censorship reduces innovafion, erodes trust and negafively impacts social cohesion.

Who is the arbiter of the truth? How do we know they are always right? What happens when the
truth changes?

A good example of evolving truth is eggs, which were once healthy for us and then bad for us and
now healthy once again.

The other concern is making government bodies exempt from these regulafions. This would cause
people to have a high level of distrust in all government informafion.

There are examples in my lifefime of when we were told a government ‘truth’ only to later discover it
was not the case.

Such as the weapons of mass destrucfion held by Sadam Hussein and used as a jusfificafion to go to
war.

This was harmful misinformafion.

If such legislafion was enacted, no one should be exempt.

Kind you for your fime.

Owen Chesterton
