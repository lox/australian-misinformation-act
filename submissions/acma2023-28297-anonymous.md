Conversation is part of being human. Debate is part of being human. Debating our individual point of
view about what the truth is is a right. Freedom of speech is an inalienable right. This bill will take
freedom of speech away from all Australians. Shutting down debate, which is what this bill will do, is
not the world I want my children to grow up in.

It's not up to the government to decide what is misinformation or disinformation. It's not up to the
government to decide what truth is.

How does this bill make Australia better? When in history has the person pushing censorship been
the good guy? Why is the government exempt from this legislation? What if the government is
wrong?
