Concerning this proposed “Misinformation Bill” your assumption that what you label as
“Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.” Is erroneous and is in
fact opposite of democracy, inclusivity, equality and does not pose a threat to our society
nor economy.

The principles of Democracy, Equity, diversity & Inclusivity recognise that there is a
divergence of opinions and allow them to be aired and discussed in a healthy and open
debate. There people can decide for themselves what’s in their best interests or in the
best interests of the country based on the arguments and evidence presented.

Diversity of opinion and open debate is a strength of a vibrant country that respects the
will and intelligence of its citizens. Australia has done well with a diverse multicultural
background. What you’re proposing where there is one arbiter of “truth” censoring
alternative opinions is the complete opposite to intellectual honesty, debate and what has
made Australia and other “free” nations great. If the Labour government goes ahead with
this heavy-handed bill, how will that look like in the history books ….very unfavourably
and certainly NOT inclusive, equitable, diverse, nor democratic. This will also backfire on
the politicians making this Bill, remember that it s a two-edged sword should your views
and opinions fall out of favour with another government in power.

Sincerely,
Lee Tye
