# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 Submission

I absolutely oppose this Misinformed and socially destructive legislation.

I never thought I would live in a country that employed thought police. Who does my government think they are, that they
can give themselves and mainstream media a free pass on BS, whilst forcing their version of 'TRUTH' on the population.

Do I have any faith in my government to not misuse and manipulate this?

NO - Certainly not any of the major parties - Absolute power corrupts absolutely has never been more true and this is a rung on
that ladder.

I watched the SA Chief Health Officer, Ms N Spurier, in an official advert tell South Australians that the covid vaccines were
fully tested (they are still in the trial phase) and safe (civil suits for vaccine injury are underway as I write this) and they have no
late onset side effects, which is a claim that no drug company can make about their product unless the drug has been in the public
arena for 10-15 years and these experimental drugs were barely a year in!

So she was either horrendously ignorant or MISINFORMED or she was BLATANTLY LYING to the public which she is
supposed to have a duty of care for and tell the FACTS to.

So unless government at all levels, all public employees and all media are subject to your Ministry of Truth's Minority Report
legislation and personally responsible for any fines incurred (not out of the public pocket), then this is nothing more than a thinly
disguised attempt to silence dissenters.

I think the likes of Galileo, who was vilified and then proven right and every other scientist/citizen who has ever been suppressed,
ostracised, ridiculed, imprisoned, forced into destitution, had their reputations shredded or just plain murdered for daring to go
against the state sanctioned 'Truth' by presenting facts, including all those now proven correct after the covid debacle, would be
equally horrified and appalled that the government of the day in Australia is now trying to cement their version of truth into
legislation to prevent any and all opposition to their supreme authority.

Australia will be lost if this Communistic tool comes into effect.

What incredible Hubris from a minority government struggling to control a populace that clearly, by the numbers, did not want
them.

So this is how you silence us, so you can magnify the state sanctioned mantras and propaganda without debate or opposition and
bring us around to your way of thinking?

How has this country sunk so low?

No! No! NO!

Feel free to publish my response.
