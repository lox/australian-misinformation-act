Submission relating to the proposal for new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation.

To: ACMA Authority

I wish to express my strong objection to the draft Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

My principal objections are.

- No mandated has been sought for this insidious over-sighting of social media content for the

presence of misinformation or disinformation.

- The idea that a government or its agents are the default arbiters of what constitutes

misinformation or disinformation in social media content is an anathema to concept of a free and
democratic society.

- The understanding of what constitutes misinformation or disinformation in social media

content is nebulous one, and at the governmental level its definitions may easily be shaped by bias,
politicisation, revenge, group think, loyalties, malevolence, and all manner of irrational human
beliefs.

- In my opinion the Bill insidiously crosses a line that separates democracy from autocracy

I submit that the proposal to grant ACMA new powers under the draft Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 be abandoned because in my
opinion the Bill is an autocratic instrument which has no place in the governance of a democratic
society.
