I am writing to submit my strong concerns about the draft legislation relating to misinformation and disinformation.

I understand that Labor is intending to introduce legislation relating to social media which may involve monetary penalties for
companies that publish "misinformation". This really worries me as there is often a difference of opinion about what
misinformation in fact is and a wide range of information is needed in our democracy so that the public can make up their own
minds about what is true and what they believe. I do not want to live in a society where information is censored such as it is in
China or North Korea.

I agree that limits should be places on social media companies from promoting material that could be harmful such as pushing
porn on minors or hateful trolling of particular people but I do not agree that a government body should be determining what is
misinformation.

I ask that the Labor party scrap their plans for this legislation.

Kind regards
