Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

My name I want to make my voice heard and standing with other Australians to say that this
# ism
proposed 'Misinformation Bill’ is very disturbing, unsuitable and likely to bring bad results if it were to continue and
extremely dangerous.

More importantly, this Bill essentially gives the state, through ACMA, a mechanism to determine what counts as
acceptable communication and what counts as misinformation or disinformation. This potentially gives the state the
ability to control the availability and presentation of information to everyday Australians, granting it power beyond
anything that a government should have in a free and democratic society.

Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because
it’s easy to see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Meta said that the law would have a “chilling”
effect on free speech. It would be easy for a government to label as “misinformation” anything that could hurt its
reputation (as many authoritarian governments already do). Giving the government such unrestricted power is
terrifying.

Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false.
We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this
vital process.

It’s easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found
inconvenient. The proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed.

Please reject this proposed law.
