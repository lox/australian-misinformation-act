# Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023

 I strongly disagree with the implementa�on of this Bill for the following reasons:

 1.Suppressing informa�on of any kind is suppressing free speech. Informa�on is constantly changing; some is reliable and some is not. How does suppressing informa�on help Australians?

 2. A healthy democracy needs freedom of speech where ideas can be discussed and debated, and previously unseen solu�ons found.

 3. Fringe views rarely gain momentum. People should be allowed to be exposed to all discussions on a topic and then decide for themselves what to be believe. We need a market place of ideas in order to get a broad view of a topic.

 4. Governments and their authorized bodies should never be given the power to decide what is or is not true. Governments have lied in the past (Tampa, Weapons of Mass destruc�on).

 5. This new Bill will allow ACMA to impose significant penal�es on social media pla�orms (and individuals using those pla�orms) if they allow perceived misinforma�on/disinforma�on. Senator Alex An�c has discovered through Freedom of Informa�on that the Australian government intervened 4000 �mes to restrict or censor posts on various social media pla�orms about Covid-19, many of which have since been shown to be correct. This must not happen again.
