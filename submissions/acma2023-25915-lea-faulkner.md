Dear Sir/Madam

The Albanese Government have released a draft on “combatting” Misinformation and
Disinformation (Their words)
This is a direct assault on the human rights and the sovereign people of Australia.
The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.
People have the right to freedom of thought.
People have a right of freedom of opinion and expression, this right includes freedom
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
People have the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
It is a big slippery slope when the Government and the people it controls an in the
media are exempt from this draft.

A totalitarian regime starts with one party controlling the Media.
One party controlling the message.
One party deciding what is true.
One party censoring speech and silencing opposition.
One party dividing people into “us” and ‘them’.
It started when good people turned a blind eye and let it happen.

I would like to hope that won’t be you, so I am interested to know what you plan to do
about this “Draft”

Thank you for your time.

Regards

Lea Faulkner
