I'm not sure how the Australian Government can't see that this Misinformation and Disinformation
Bill is "1984" come to pass and writ large. Then again, perhaps the Australian Government can see it
and is pleased about it!

I am very thankful for the variety of news media that I was able to access in the aftermath of Covid,
to try to unpack what had happened to us, a process that was not helped by conformist mainstream
media parroting whatever they were supposed to say, dim-witted journalists who lacked all
credibility and insight, and unimaginative government employees making sure that they said
whatever would allow them to keep getting paid. Google and facebook were highly censored and as
good as useless throughout the whole ordeal. Months after the independent media had broken new
ground, the mainstream media followed suit with a few pitiful crumbs of truth, when it was already
too late.

I don't know how to say this to you. I don't believe in you anymore, you, the Australian Government.
Whatever media that you end up providing me, I won't be listening. My TV has been switched off
since the days of Dr Kerry Chant. As I said, if this bill passes, I will not consume any of your
propaganda and self-congratulatory lies. If this bill passes, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and
Ignorance is Strength will become out new anthem, and you will be responsible for it.
