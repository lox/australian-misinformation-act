Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
# Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my strong opposition towards the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian
citizen, I firmly believe that this bill undermines the freedom of speech that is a cornerstone
# of our democracy.

The creation of two classes of citizens within this bill is deeply concerning. On one hand,
politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions are granted the power to
spread information, whether it is deemed true or false. On the other hand, regular citizens,
who often possess unique knowledge and insights, are relegated to a group that may face
restrictions on their expression. This bill disproportionately affects the voices of ordinary
Australians, jeopardizing the very essence of our democratic society.

The proposed legislation poses a significant threat to freedom of speech, as digital services
will be forced to implement more restrictive speech policies than what currently exists. The
broad scope of this code, applicable to the entire industry, exacerbates the harm it can bring.
It is an impossible task to accurately determine what is true or untrue, as new information
# constantly emerges that challenges widely accepted facts.

Moreover, the bill encompasses not just provably false information but also true information
# that may be considered "misleading" or "deceptive." Freedom of speech is invaluable as it

allows for open and honest discussions, allowing for the exploration of different viewpoints

and the pursuit of truth.

# Another troubling aspect of this bill is the potential for industry bodies, influenced by

industry giants, to create codes that serve as barriers to entry for new competitors. This antiÂ­
# competitive behaviour not only hampers innovation and stifles competition but also grants

more power to the largest digital services, allowing them to set their own regulations while
burdening smaller platforms and websites.

Furthermore, the bill's reliance on dominant digital platforms to set policies disregards the

# efforts of competition regulators worldwide to foster diversity and lower entry barriers. By prioritizing the viewpoints of the Government and accredited institutions over those of
ordinary Australians, the bill hampers diversity of opinions and limits our ability to engage in


-----

meaningful sense-making.

The threats posed by this bill to digital platform providers and ordinary users are deeply

concerning. The imposition of reputational damage, financial penalties, and business

inefficiencies will disproportionately impact the livelihoods and freedom of individuals
# attempting to exercise their right to freedom of expression.

This legislation threatens the very foundations of our democracy, which rely on access to

diverse information for informed decision-making. By categorizing certain political party

# viewpoints as misinformation and allowing their removal from digital platforms, the bill

undermines the public's ability to make informed voting decisions. Furthermore, it places
independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers under unnecessary scrutiny,
# attempting to ruin their reputations and favouring Government-authorised publications.

As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe in upholding our commitment to the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 explicitly protects the right to freedom of opinion

and expression, including the right to seek and impart information and ideas through any

media. By disregarding the diverse perspectives and experiences of ordinary Australians, this

bill violates our fundamental rights and values.

I firmly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation

and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and urge you to reconsider its provisions. It is crucial to protect

freedom of speech, respect diverse viewpoints, and encourage open dialogue for the
# betterment of our society and democracy.

Thank you for considering my feedback on this important matter. I am happy for you to

make this submission public.

Yours sincerely,

Trevor Clayton
