**_Disinformation) Bill 2023_**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my strong concerns and opposition to the proposed Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian
citizen and a passionate advocate for free speech and open dialogue, I find this bill deeply troubling
and believe it threatens the foundations of our democracy.

First and foremost, the bill assumes that the government and its accredited institutions are the sole
arbiters of truth and can determine what is true or false, without considering the experiences and
viewpoints of ordinary Australians. This approach negates the diversity of viewpoints that is crucial
in the process of sense-making and undermines the importance of considering all possibilities. By
deplatforming certain views before they can even be shared, this bill restricts and stifles the
necessary diversity in our public discourse.

Moreover, this bill presents ordinary people as incapable of engaging in a public sense-making
process without the potential of causing serious harm. This presupposition is both condescending
and undermines the fundamental principle that all citizens have the right to express their opinions
and ideas freely. By suggesting that the viewpoints of ordinary people are more likely to cause harm
than those of the government or its accredited journalists and educators, the bill further
marginalizes and suppresses the voices of everyday Australians.

Another concerning aspect of this bill is the threat of interference, which is directed towards both
digital platform providers and ordinary users of digital platforms. The threats imposed on digital
platform providers, such as making reputation-damaging records and imposing business
inconveniences, have the potential to cause significant financial loss or even insolvency. This heavyhanded approach creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust, which is detrimental to both
businesses and the public.

Similarly, the threat to haul ordinary users before the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) under Section 19 is deeply unsettling. Such actions not only cause undue stress
and distress but also waste the valuable time of Australian citizens. It is especially concerning that
individuals may be forced to report on their friends, families, or political co-agitants, further eroding
the sense of trust and community that is essential in our society.

This level of government intervention and control over public discourse is reminiscent of oppressive
regimes and stands in stark contrast to the values of our nation, where mateship and a sense of
community are cherished ideals. The potential fines and penalties imposed on those who choose not
to comply with unjust reporting requirements are fundamentally unfair and unjust.

Additionally, independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers will be burdened with
complex reporting standards and misinformation reports, with the clear intention of tarnishing their
reputation. This places non-accredited competitors at a severe disadvantage, pushing them towards
unprofitability and, ultimately, extinction. It is evident that this bill aims to manipulate public opinion
by favouring government-approved journalists while silencing alternative perspectives.

As this proposed legislation gains traction, it will inevitably lead to a proliferation of misinformation
and disinformation reports aimed at discrediting non-approved journalists and publications. This
distortion of the media landscape will serve to financially benefit government-approved journalists
in the long-term, while suppressing open debate and diverse viewpoints that are vital for a healthy
democracy.

In conclusion, I strongly urge you to reconsider the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. This bill not only undermines freedom of
speech and stifles diversity of thought but also raises concerns about government overreach and
control over public discourse. It is imperative to ensure that any legislation aimed at combating
misinformation and disinformation does not impede the rights and voices of ordinary Australians or
encroach upon our democratic values.

Thank you for considering my concerns. I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that you
will act in the best interests of our great nation.

Yours sincerely,
