To Whom it May Concern,

We are writing a submission regarding the ‘Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

The Albanese Government has released the aforesaid bill which, if passed, would empower itself and Big Tech new powers to
monitor all online platforms and remove anything that it doesn't agree with. Essentially, this would be authorising and promoting
only THEIR declaration of what is true or false. However, this SHOULD NOT be. This submission is a protest against the Bill,
and a request for its removal.

According to the Minister for Communications: “Mis and disinformation sows division within the community, undermines trust
and can threaten public health and safety. The Albanese Government is committed to keeping Australians safe online.”

Generally, it is true that when certain information is wrongly used, there may be strife, mistrust or threatened health and safety, as
a resulting effect. Hence, the Government does have a responsibility: to seek the REMOVAL of ANYTHING, on or off-line,
which is FORBIDDEN by the Eternal LORD GOD. As the Most Supreme Judge and Creator of all people, it is His moral law,
as recorded in the Bible, which must be obeyed.

Unfortunately, this is rarely performed. Conversely, the Government often legislates and enforces an abundance of wicked laws
and actions,[1] and it is now pushing to LEGALISE its deceit, which is contrary to Biblical Truth.

For example, Leviticus 19:11 states:

"Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another."

Again, in Exodus 20:16 :

"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour."

The Albanese Government's Bill, proposes the blocking of materials that will stand against the Government's actions (including

opposition to the LORD God who created the whole universe, who is the Actual Truth – in John 14:6, the Lord Jesus Christ

says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life".

God warns against despising the Truth, and especially His Word, the Bible. In Proverbs 13:13 there is a solemn warning, along
with a promise to those who esteem His Law:

“Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded".

God requires the Government to be truthful and trustworthy, and promises reward to those who revere His commandments. For

the good of our nation, and as responsible individuals, please uphold what is true and right, and REMOVE this Combating
Misinformation and Disinformation Bill.

Yours sincerely,

Neil and Josephine van der Wel
