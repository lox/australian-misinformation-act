As eluded to in my short comment, I have very grave concerns for any censorship of information that
doesn't fit or support the narrative of the day. This is how we learn and grow, through healthy
respectful debate where both sides get present their evidence so that we the people can decide
whether something makes sense or not. We the people should be that independent body that
decides what is misinformation or disinformation.

The way that the Government and the Media has handled the last 3+ years of Covid has caused a
great deal of mistrust within the community.

One example is where drs have been censored, targeted, labelled conspiracy theorists for promoting
treatments such as Ivermectin where hundreds of peer reviewed studies have shown how effective it
was with not only the alleged Covid outbreak but many other common colds and influenzas. Drs
were threatened should they prescribe it and the Government Health authorities themselves were
spreading what we now know was misinformation because Ivermectin is now allowed to be
prescribed for all of the alleged variants of Covid in some countries.

What should have happened in that circumstance and what should happen in all future
circumstances where there is a difference of opinion/beliefs/facts/perspective is that a debate
should be set up and live streamed so that we the people can decide for ourselves.

There is a massive trust issue within society and the only way that this trust issue can resolved is with
100% transparency.

Social media outlets themselves such as Facebook and Twitter have attempted to censor content
deemed false through their own independent alleged fact checkers which have now been proven in
an American court case that the fact checkers were in fact just opinions!

The people have had enough mis and disinformation already from the Government who took their
advice from the WHO and WEF that now wants to introduce new legislation pertaining to the very
topic they themselves are guilty ofâ€¦. Another case in point is the mask wearing. So many studies are
available that prove that a majority of masks are akin to expecting a chainmail fence to protect you
from a mosquito as they are to protecting you from a virus because of the micron size. In fact, masks
worn for long periods of time are more dangerous for our health along with lockdowns and
mandates.

Again, the only way forward to combat mis and disinformation is with 100% transparency and that
will only be achieved with respectful discourse between experts from opposing sides of the fence
that is live streamed!
