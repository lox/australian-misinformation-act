Dear Australians

I would like the honour of sharing my thoughts on the proposed Misinformation and
Disinformation Bill

I can understand why this idea has been proposed and it should be carefully considered.
I understand that some harm has or may arise from people sharing and believing
information that may not be true. But the harm this bill could do if accepted far, far, far
exceeds the harm of it being rejected.

I would like to believe that our leaders and law policy makers have and will always have
Australians best interest at heart, and they may aspire to maintain a level of freedom of
speech, choice and religion while using these new proposed powers this bill would give,
but at its very heart this bill could easily take these freedoms away.

We are not communist China, North Korea, we are not Russians or Nazi Germany, we
are Australians, and we are free, and we have always fought to be so. My grandparents
all fought in wars so we could be free. And now we are considering handing this
freedom over to leaders who promise us that they know what truth is, what is right and
what is good. They ask us to trust them while they decide what information to share
and what not to. Who to silence and who to give an open platform to.

Power always corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This bill has so much
potential for harm and abuse and it should not be pursued. With this bill legitimate
speech on pressing social issues could so easily be silenced and Australian human rights
freedom of speech and communication could be abolished.

In addition, with such excessive penalties for allowing freedom of speech, online
platforms are probably going to play it safe and limit freedom of speech even further
than the Bill demands.

A strong community is built not on limiting its thoughts, understandings and beliefs, but
on diversity, respect, understanding and on robust discussion. It is okay to disagree
with each other, we are not little children that need to be protected from hurt feelings.
We are strong, we are Australians, we are not afraid, and we will not be put in a box and
force fed. This bill needs to be rejected.

Thanks for your time, kind regards
