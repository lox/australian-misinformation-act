Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

The most concerning thing about this proposed bill is that it does not deal with the actual problem of misinformation.
What is considered misinformation to one is useful information to another. The big question is how we can determine
what counts as “misinformation”. No one has a monopoly on truth. It is impossible for a government body to be
responsible for making these decisions. What is truth. No one can define it! If no one can define what is truth, how can
it be made into a bill?

There are so many examples where a previously-accepted idea was found to be untrue, but only after much
investigation and debate. Free speech is needed for us to arrive at the truth.

The idea that people sitting in an office somewhere in Canberra hold all the wisdom on what’s true and what is
“misinformation” is absurd     - and deeply dangerous. It’s the kind of move expected by a totalitarian government. We
are supposed to be a free nation.

Reject this authoritarianism.
