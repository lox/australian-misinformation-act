I would like to register my opposition to managing information online via the proposed legislation.

I oppose this legislation on the following grounds:

1. Science and medicine are never settled and is always evolving. Therefore, there must always be

room for transparent debate in a culture of curiosity rather than our current culture of dogma,
cancellation, and intolerance for the ‘unpopular’ of the day.

2. The MEAA Journalists Code of Ethics

3. The principles of informed consent.

4. The principles of democracy

5. A review of the last three years and how misinformation and disinformation has been defined

and with harmful consequences.

I must stress that I oppose online hate speech, (the definition of which should not extend to simply
holding a view that is different to others and which is expressed respectfully), online abuse, bullying,
threats, or unsubstantiated defamation. Areas which online platforms have been and remain, in some
parts, loathe to regulate and/or act upon.

1. **Science and Medicine: The first point I would like to make is that no one entity, individual or**

Government should be the sole authority on any truth. And when it comes to science and
medicine, as we should have tragically learned these last few years, there should never be
assumptions made that anything at a given point in time, is absolute and final.

In fact, every high school science student is taught to ‘test a hypothesis’ and then retest.

Similarly medical students are taught that half of everything they are taught will be wrong in five years
post their graduation. To keep arriving at best practice, the medical and scientific world has always
understood the need to be humble, to debate, and to be prepared to be wrong in the interests of others.

In fact, one could argue that this is why medical journals exist - to consider the views and experiences of
peers and colleagues.

So how is that we now appear to be subscribing to the view that ‘science’ is easily settled? For history is
littered with evidence that this is not so. And that great harm can and has been done through thinking
that it is.

“The medical establishment — comprising of doctors, regulatory authorities, licensing bodies, patenting
offices and of course the pharmaceuticals — is often seen as the last word on health practices. It is
considered an infallible institution immune to error. However, its track-record reeks of fatal blunders
which call into question its credibility”. (Bayraktar 2016)

Following is some of the significant medical mistakes which have cost humanity dearly. (Text is
[reproduced from this article), which, thanks to the ability to challenge them more openly, were reversed](https://www.trtworld.com/life/7-times-the-medical-establishment-got-it-wrong-167992)
in either their general acceptance or banned altogether.

# Promotion of smoking by doctors

In the US, doctors and Big Tobacco were complicit in promoting cigarettes from the 1930s to the 1950s.

Tobacco companies paid physicians, throat doctors in particular, to recommend smoking as a remedy for
throat irritation and to perpetuate the notion that smoking was healthy.


-----

Cigarette advertisements in medical journals were the norm. Images of doctors smoking in print ads were
a common marketing ploy.

_The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published its first cigarette advertisement in 1933_
"after careful consideration of the extent to which cigarettes were used by physicians in practice." The
advertisements ran for two decades.

_The New York State Journal of Medicine also ran ads by cigarette brand Chesterfield with the claim that its_
product "just as pure as the water you drink."

**Dr Freeman's ‘icepick lobotomies'**

[Dr Walter Freeman was the developer of the ‘icepick' lobotomy, a form of brain surgery he advocated as a](http://projects.wsj.com/lobotomyfiles/?ch=two)
panacea to mental illness.

All told, he performed 3,500 lobotomies from 1937 to 1967. The procedure had a disastrous 14 per cent
fatality rate and the outcomes for survivors varied dramatically: some were left permanently crippled,
others lived in a perpetual vegetative state.

Dr. Freeman's trigger-happy attitude towards lobotomy caused his long-time research partner Dr. James
Watts to leave their practice due to the high rate of unwarranted lobotomies and cruelty he observed.

Freeman had questionable criteria as to who was a good candidate for the procedure. He administered
the lobotomy for complaints as minor as neck pain.

Children were even subjected to the procedure for perceived low intelligence or hyperactive behaviour.

**The thalidomide catastrophe**

The drug thalidomide, created in Germany by the Grunenthal group, was heavily marketed to pregnant
women for morning sickness in the 50s and 60s.

It was available in 46 countries until it was banned in 1961 following a massive spike in the birth of
infants with physical deformities worldwide to women who had taken the drug while pregnant.

At least 80,000 babies died before birth and 20,000 were born without limbs due to thalidomide. The
consumption of thalidomide by pregnant women resulted in a wide range of birth defects including
severe deformity of the limbs or in extreme cases, the absence of limbs.

Reports suggest the companies which distributed and produced the drug in various countries were aware
of the side effects that maimed thousands of babies in the womb worldwide but ignored them for the sake
of profit.

# TRT WORLD AND AGENCIES

The thalidomide catastrophe maimed thousands of babies and killed far more: it remains one of the
greatest man-made global disasters.

**The Vioxx scandal**

Vioxx was a painkiller approved for use by the FDA in 1999; it led to the death of 60,000 people in the US.

The Archives of Internal Medicine reveals American pharmaceutical company Merck concealed data for
years that proved Vioxx caused an alarming increase in the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck's
revenue from Vioxx was 2.5 billion dollars.

In 2004 the drug was removed from the market.

An FDA scientist raised concern early on when he discovered the damaging effects of vioxx, however, his
**_discovery was suppressed by his bosses. US government officials have questioned the relationship_**
between Merck and the FDA.

David Graham who works in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety told Forbes Magazine, "If the judgement is
that there's blood on Merck's hands," Graham added, "There's blood on the FDA's hands as well."

He drew comparisons between the fatalities caused by Vioxx and the number of those who died in the
Vietnam War, which also totalled 60,000. He lamented the institutional bias at the FDA that led to those
deaths.

"People should turn to Congress and demand a drug safety system that is free from corporate influence –
and a distinct center for drug safety."

# War on dietary fat

[In an about-face on fat, the US dietary guidelines advisory committee removed its previous](https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/dietary-guidelines/previous-dietary-guidelines/2015)
recommendations against fat and cholesterol consumption in its most recent report.


-----

The medical establishment had for decades advised against the consumption of fat and cholesterol, which
in turn led to a higher consumption of carbohydrates and sugars. Studies show this change in dietary
habits had a strong correlation to soaring rates of diabetes, obesity and heart disease.

**When life-saving practices are rejected**

Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian obstetrician who theorised in 1850 that physicians transferred
perpeural disease — known as childbed fever — to women in the maternity ward due to the common
practice of doctors at the hospital delivering babies after conducting barehanded autopsies on diseased
corpses.

He came to that conclusion after observing a high rate of deaths in the hospital maternity ward in
comparison with the low death rates at the clinic where babies were delivered by midwives.

Semmelweis went on to implement a handwashing protocol in the maternity ward, which proved
successful. It resulted in death rates declining from 18 percent to 2.2 percent.

# TRT WORLD AND AGENCIES

 Austrian physician Dr Semmelweis

Though he was armed with numbers on his side, he only received minimal support. Most colleagues
resented him for suggesting they were the cause of their patients' deaths.

And as news of his handwashing protocol spread, he was increasingly the target of derision in medical
circles throughout Europe. He was regarded as a pariah for challenging the status quo.

Eventually his mental health was called into question and his colleagues had him admitted to a mental
hospital where he was beaten. He succumbed to his injuries just days later.


-----

Over the last three years I have been astounded at the willingness of the Australian government and the
Australian people to close their minds to the practice of real science whilst simultaneously choosing to
ignore the real and potential vested interests in those promulgating our public health approaches. And
then, to continue to avoid reflection, or the clearly obvious contradictions, fallacies and beyond poor
outcomes levelled against the Australian people. A problem, which may have been averted had there been
more willingness to listen to a range of expert voices, whose dire predictions sadly have manifest.

Not only were our regulators, bureaucrats and politicians unwilling to do this, our media and the social
media platforms who have clear conflicts of interest, embarked upon a censorship campaign the likes of
which Australia has never seen. Preventing Australians from being able to make more informed choices.

The evidence for this is everywhere, and I suspect will have been more articulately and extensively
collated and referenced in other submissions. So, I will endeavour to provide something new,
notwithstanding the need to add that we should not need a plethora or medical or scientific evidence
beyond our own eyes. To use the vaccines for example (and I have been vaccinated for other illnesses and
so have my children), we were told they were safe and effective.

The sheer existence of the Vaccine Compensation Scheme is acknowledgement enough that they were
never completely safe for everyone, and the sheer unprecedented volume of adverse events reported to
the TGA DAEN, surpassing ALL other vaccines combined is further evidence of this. Regardless of how
many theories are posited as to how they cannot all be related to the vaccine, these novel agents, were
[until only last month, listed on the TGA’s Black Triangle Scheme . Which my definition, means that ANY](https://www.tga.gov.au/how-we-regulate/monitoring-safety-and-shortages/report-adverse-event-or-incident/report-adverse-events-medicines-and-biologicals/black-triangle-scheme)
adverse event following their administration ought to point first at the agent.

What we have seen, across online news and social media channels, has been a removal of posted speaking
of these adverse events, with the EXPRESS reason given that they would ‘upset’ people or impact upon
vaccine uptake or undermine public health policy. The net effect of which, has been to hide the extent of
injuries. And we now have an unexplained excess mortality in 2022 of 12%, with at least a third of these
unrelated to Covid. “Of the non-covid-19 excess deaths, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease,
diabetes, dementia, and cancer were all higher than predicted by between 2% and 17% (Barrett 2023).
Australian media seems to have no appetite or willingness to investigate this extraordinary increase, and
anyone who tries, no matter how qualified to do so, is labelled, censored or de platformed.

The passing of this legislation will give even more impetus and legitimisation to practices which have
seen Australian’s making decisions in a vacuum.

I have submitted numerous Freedom of Information requests this past year. The most distressing of
dataset responses regarding safety, is FOI 4217, which requested the total number of fatal outcomes
reported after vaccination in Australians under 18 years. There were 17, although the TGA disputes 8 of
them. These Australian children were aged 5 and 15. And whilst they did not provide what I had asked
for, which was the time frame between injection and death, they did in the determination provide the
following data:

**_“Nine of the reports included in the document are published in the DAEN – medicines. The timeframe_**
**_between vaccination and death was reported to the TGA for 5 of these cases, with the reported_**
**_timeframe being 4 days for 2 cases, and 5, 13 and 17 days for remaining 3 cases.”_**


-----

For those reading this, what if these were your children?

**_Would you have preferred to have known this prior to vaccinating your own children believing that_**
**_these injections were completely safe and effective?_**

[Whilst only this past week, the TGA issued a warning regarding Turmeric after 1 fatality, and was covered](https://7news.com.au/news/public-health/liver-injury-tgas-turmeric-warning-for-over-600-medicines-and-supplements-c-11606983)
by multiple media outlets, the fact that 17 reports of DEATH following the administrations of a Black
Triangle, provisionally approved ( at that time ) Covid injection, in a population with minimal to no
substantial mortality risk, and which occurred in at least five children at the intervals above received NO
media coverage. What parent, had they known this, would have felt that the Covid 19 vaccines were safe
and effective. Drs who tried to make their concerns known to both their patients, Government,
professional colleges and other appropriate forums were vilified as pariahs, and worse, removed from
practice and remain so. There has been no public warning issued by the TGA. No media. And therefore no
public outcry.

The other element to the FOI above is that the TGA notes that they only have timeframe information on
five of the 9-17 children. Whilst at the same time claiming that EVERY death is investigated thoroughly.
Journalists who have tried to raise this with their editors have reported being shut down. And the
complex web of vested financial interests has likely exerted significant influence on these decisions.

If we believe that our nation has the right to prevent people from being informed enough to make the
appropriate considerations relevant to their own unique health and personal circumstances, we have
fallen to a most shameful low, that this bill will only plunge us further beyond.

**“Vaccination alone is not effective at stopping infection or transmission of the virus from person**

**to person”**

**Chief Health Officer Paul Kelly July 19, 2022**


-----

As far as being effective, such that these products would prevent infection and transmission to the extent
that they were mandated in most employment sectors (although despite ‘following the settled and
allegedly irrefutable science’ each state appears to have interpreted it differently. An unvaccinated barista
in Melbourne was a threat to the public, however a barista in the ACT was not!) there has never been
compelling or significant evidence to support this ‘information’. In fact, there is more evidence to the
contrary. The first is, our own lived experience. According to the Worldometer Australia’s COVID cases
are 11, 743, 116. And we all know people who have had been repeatedly infected.

However, looking more deeply at the evidence upon which mandates were predicated, Australians have
been asked to ‘follow the health advice’ for the past three years, with those well placed to question it due
to their eminent qualifications, labelled everything from anti vaxers to conspiracy theorists.

Their questions one could argue, continue to be vindicated, given Australia’s marked deviation from the
[ratified 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, and the unfolding reality that](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2022/05/australian-health-management-plan-for-pandemic-influenza-ahmppi.pdf)
most measures have failed to deliver on their promises.

Information received via official comment and Freedom of Information requests to various state health
departments however are yet to reveal what evidence, if any, they hold to justify the inconsistently
applied past and current vaccine mandate requirements across the nation.

Whilst former NSW Premier Dominic Perrotet was publicly reiterating on radio that “There is no
evidence that vaccines prevent transmission,” the acting federal health minister Senator Katy Gallagher
was responding to Senator Ralph Babet’s queries regarding COVID-19 vaccine safety with “It’s not just an
individual decision…and about keeping yourself safe, it’s about keeping other people safe from…the
virus…It’s a community responsibility to be vaccinated.”

A response which appears at odds with advice received from the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA)
and Pfizer itself.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is responsible for ‘evaluating, assessing, and monitoring
products that are defined as therapeutic goods’ and falls under the governance of the federal Department
of Health and Ageing.

A spokesperson from the TGA stated, “Transmission effects are not an approved indication of these
vaccines as these were not analysed in the initial clinical trial studies. This is clearly stated in the
Australian Public Summary Report (AusPAR) for each vaccine candidate.”

[Referring to this information for the Pfizer vaccine the Australian Public Assessment Report for](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210125.pdf)
[BNT162b2 (mRNA) ( Jan 2021) states, ‘In addition to the unknown longer-term safety and unknown](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-bnt162b2-mrna-210125.pdf)
duration of vaccine protection, there are other limitations with the submitted data.’ The document
explains that questions which were not yet addressed at the time of the vaccine roll out included:

‘Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic infection and viral transmission’; Vaccine data in pregnant women
and lactating mothers; Vaccine efficacy and safety in immunocompromised individuals; Vaccine efficacy
and safety in paediatric subjects (< 16 years old).’

On October 10 2022, in the European Parliament Janine Small, Pfizer representative, also responded in
answer to a question about whether their COVID – 19 vaccine was tested for transmission with “Did we
know about stopping immunisation (sic) before it entered the market?

No.”

A formal response was received from ACT Health granting partial access to five emails in Sep 2021 from
ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman. However, the content of these emails was completely redacted
(blacked out) with the following comment:

“Partial redactions have been made to the documents where it contains information that I consider, on
balance, to be contrary to the public interest to disclose …. The information contained in these folios is


-----

partially comprised of personal information and information obtained through confidential discussions
including information that relates to other jurisdictions and business affairs of other agencies. The
disclosure of this information is highly likely to cause harm by prejudicing the deliberative process of
government by discouraging the AHPPC committee from providing full and candid advice and could
reasonably be expected to prejudice intergovernmental relations”.

And other jurisdictions? Ambulance Health Victoria responded that they do not hold any medical or
scientific evidence upon which they based COVID Vaccine mandates and take direction from Health
Victoria. Health Victoria responded with 260 pages of no substantial evidence other than repeating that
the vaccines were necessary to prevent transmission and infection. This reponse took them over 6
months to provide.

Health Western Australia replied via comment, “The department advises that we are unable to provide
copies of any scientific papers as this would be a breach of copyright laws.”

The South Australian Department of Health and Wellbeing has not responded with any information
despite a Freedom of Information request being lodged at the end of September 2022. It is now almost 12
months, and I am awaiting an internal review of over three months duration. NSW Health responded after
6 months with the following:

“The information within this point is widely available in the public domain including peer reviewed and
published reports and the NSW Ministry of Health does not hold any records other than these publicly
available information to respond to this part of the request, pursuant to section 58(1)(b) of the GIPA Act.

Queensland Health responded to a FOI request with “Queensland Health does not conduct specific
research or hold the documented evidence that relates to COVID-19 vaccines. This component of your
application would be best directed to the Australian Department of Health and ATAGI.”

ATAGI is the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and provides technical advice to the
Minister for Health and Aged Care on the immunisation program for COVID-19 vaccines.

Dr Christopher Blythe, Co-Chair of ATAGI, stated however in December 2021 that “ATAGI has not
provided a recommendation for mandates at any time.”

A spokesperson for the TGA, on mandatory vaccinations, replied, “The TGA does not give clinical advice,
nor does it make recommendations or decisions about the use of medicines, health products or
treatments.”

Whilst the state governments appear to defer to ATAGI and the TGA for evidence and guidance regarding
the need for vaccine mandates, it is difficult to locate any medical or scientific basis for this.

I use these FOI’s to illustrate the paucity of evidence used to qualify the public health directions and
subsequent media corroboration, with no apparent legitimate due diligence or fact checking. Yet the
statement of ‘safe and effective’ remained the single acceptable truth, and all else challenging it, not
matter what sound facts were used, were considered ‘mis/dis information’.

Australians trusted their officials and their media, and many have been harmed and worse.

**_2._** **_Journalism Code of Ethics:_**

MEAA Journalist Code of Ethics

_Respect for truth and the public’s right to information are fundamental principles of journalism. Journalists_
_search, disclose, record, question, entertain, comment and remember. They inform citizens and animate_
_democracy. They scrutinise power, but also exercise it, and should be responsible and accountable._

MEAA members engaged in journalism commit themselves to:

_Honesty_
_Fairness_
_Independence_
_Respect for the rights of others_

Journalists will educate themselves about ethics and apply the following standards:

**1. Report and interpret honestly, striving for accuracy, fairness and disclosure of all essential facts. Do not**
suppress relevant available facts, or give distorting emphasis. Do your utmost to give a fair opportunity
for reply.

**2. Do not place unnecessary emphasis on personal characteristics, including race, ethnicity, nationality,**
gender, age, sexual orientation, family relationships, religious belief, or physical or intellectual disability.

**3. Aim to attribute information to its source. Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first**
considering the source’s motives and any alternative attributable source. Where confidences are
accepted, respect them in all circumstances.

**4. Do not allow personal interest, or any belief, commitment, payment, gift or benefit, to undermine your**
accuracy, fairness or independence.

**5. Disclose conflicts of interest that affect, or could be seen to affect, the accuracy, fairness or**
independence of your journalism. Do not improperly use a journalistic position for personal gain.

**6. Do not allow advertising or other commercial considerations to undermine accuracy, fairness or**
independence.

**7. Do your utmost to ensure disclosure of any direct or indirect payment made for interviews, pictures,**
information or stories.

**8. Use fair, responsible and honest means to obtain material. Identify yourself and your employer before**
obtaining any interview for publication or broadcast. Never exploit a person’s vulnerability or ignorance
of media practice.

**9. Present pictures and sound which are true and accurate. Any manipulation likely to mislead should be**
disclosed.

**10. Do not plagiarise.**

**11. Respect private grief and personal privacy. Journalists have the right to resist compulsion to intrude.**

**12. Do your utmost to achieve fair correction of errors.**

Guidance Clause: Basic values often need interpretation and sometimes come into conflict. Ethical
_journalism requires conscientious decision-making in context. Only substantial advancement of the public_
_interest or risk of substantial harm to people allows any standard to be overridden._


-----

The last three years has seen an extraordinary departure from adherence to these journalism ethics. The
public campaigns to demonise those who are not in lock step with the prevailing narrative, whether it be
on public and individual health policy, climate, the Voice, gender politics, are without precedence.

Personally, many journalists may be unaware of their unconscious bias. Professionally there have been
[constraints placed upon them. The Trusted News Initiative made this even more difficult. Under these](https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2020/trusted-news-initiative-vaccine-disinformation)
past devices, and should the new bill be passed, how do we suppose that journalists can adhere to their
codes of ethics to ensure that balanced reporting occurs? How can journalists hold powerful interests,
whether they be corporate, government or individuals, to account in this legislated milieu?

It has not been able to occur these last three years. It will be nigh impossible moving forward.

**3.** **Informed consent.**

As a retired critical care health professional with over 25 years’ experience, informed consent was the
foundation of my practice. It is communicated in the Australian Charter of Health Care Rights.

Along with privacy, Australians have not been afforded free and informed consent on a range of health
and other issues. Free consent cannot occur where there is coercion or explicit of implied threats or
consequences for non-compliance.

This bill will further enshrine a one-sided argument for whatever the Government of the day sees fit. With
no ability for qualified individuals, to posit evidence-based arguments publicly, and no ability for member
of the public to express concern, reveal their own lived experience or ask reasonable questions about
policies imposed upon them, how can any of us claim that we are making informed decisions?

We need to have access to diverse experience and views in order to make the best decisions, as well as to
hold our policy makers to account.

**4.Democracy.**

“Democracy: A democracy is a society in which the citizens are sovereign and control the government.”

How can Australians exercise their democratic rights and functions in a society which sanctions only
certain points of view?

Over the last three years, we have seen breaches to democratic rights I would never have imagined
possible.

And because I did my due diligence via official and credible sources and made a choice to deviate from the
narrative as to what I did with my own health and knowing that I was not a risk to others because of that
same due diligence, I first experience what it feels like to be afraid of my own Government, and to be
alienated from and excluded from society.

I made an informed choice. And my health continues to be well as a result and despite being told the
opposite.

If this bill passes, how can we be assured of our collective and individual rights to be heard, and to be
respected in our views? How can we either share or have access to information that helps us to make
informed representation to our local, state and federal governments?

**4.** **The last three years.**

If this bill passes, misinformation/disinformation will constitute anything not approved or agreed upon
by the Government of the day.

When it comes to public health, those who are not wed to dogma, or who do not find the answers too
confronting to pose the questions, are aware of significant public health errors.


-----

Examples include:

1. Infection and transmission. We were first told that the vaccines would prevent both. They did not.

And were never designed or tested to prevent transmission. Yet the public were sold the intervention
on the basis that they would, and this would therefore prevent others becoming ill. They did not. And
in fact many who were never at risk of severe complications, were exposed to risks they did not need
to take.

2. Safe. The extraordinary database of adverse event on the TGA DAEN are testament to this. Groups

such as COVERSE evidence tragic outcomes which should be receiving support, and redress.

3. Masks – a Cochrane meta-analysis confirmed what the 2019 pandemic preparedness plan had

already concluded, that masks were not shown to have any significant effect. Yet those who had
posited this early in the pandemic, were labelled, and censored.

I wish I had more time to list these extensively.

**_I trust that those of you entrusted with this task on our collective behalf, will conclude on the basis of_**
**_the submissions you receive that the definitions of mis information and dis information are so_**
**_subjective, open to bias, and the influence of both corporate and political pressure, that on this_**
**_premise alone, a bill could not be passed due to the lack of this fundamentally clear foundation._**

Additionally, we must not allow our ability to be transparent, respectful and curious, for the purposed of
evolution, growth and best practice to be strangled.

I implore you to withdraw this bill in its current form.

The consequences of its passing will be an assault on all of us for generations to come.

And will form part of the undoing of any government which seeks to enforce it.

ACT.
