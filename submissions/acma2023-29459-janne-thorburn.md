I am 100% opposed to this Misinformation and disinformation draft bill.

This almost feels like we’re going down the route of communist China, censoring it’s people
with basic needs being denied if they do not agree with all their government requirements.

For that reason this bill threatens our democracy, society and economy and I would not feel
safe and my wellbeing would be threatened. The exact opposite of what you say the bill will
do, in the very first sentence of your description of ‘The Issue’.

The way you have worded this document smacks of propaganda, ultimately for the
government’s total control over what is said on social media. This was demonstrated with
how the covid era was handled, witness accounts of vaccine injury and ivermectin being a
cure and prevention treatment for the virus being censored on all major social and media
accounts. We now know that all the vaccine injuries and ivermectin cure stories have been
100% correct, yet they were censored!

You are treating your citizens as if we don’t see beyond this censorship, we are not as stupid
as you are making out.
