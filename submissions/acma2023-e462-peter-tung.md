a poorly considered piece of legislation, or at worst, a case of government overreach. It is a bad, bad proposal.
The results of such a bill will be the suppression of any ideas contrary to the government's desired narrative. Freedom of speech will
be no more. It will be an Orwellian future for Australia, with minorities unable to speak, and the social media platforms afraid to give
any time or place for any agendas other than that of the government.
Freedom of speech is a non-negotiable freedom. The slightest infringement upon free speech has dire consequences. Better to allow
the most utter lies to be aired than suppress the slightest sliver of truth, because eventually, truth will triumph, as history has taught
us. This triumph will not be made easier by governments or any other bodies stepping in with their fancied superior knowledge and
exerting a paternalism that keeps the nation from maturing and growing into a great society.
The best way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to have robust debate in the public space, and I would rather trust the
sense of the people of Australia than a government whose idea of "truth" is going to be coloured by partisan politics and subject to its
internal machinations.
No, the "Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill" will only serve to create more and greater misinformation and
disinformation. No safeguards will be foolproof enough to retain this most basic of freedoms, free speech!
