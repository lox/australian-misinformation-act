## Freedom of speech is an essential human right and a fundamental principle of Australian democracy. Without Freedom of speech, transparency and inclusiveness, we have no democracy.

 Freedom of speech also depends on a declaration of any conflict of interest so that people can understand the financial interests behind large corporations and government.

 We are extremely concerned that the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 represents a direct attack on our freedom of speech, a fundamental human right that has been taken from the medical profession since the beginning of Covid 19.

## The Bill's highly subjective and vague definition of "misinformation" grants the government arbitrary powers to determine what constitutes misinformation. The suppression of legitimate criticisms of the government, questioning of scientific and medical dogmas such as pandemic lockdowns, the suspension of good doctors offering exemptions and early treatment for Covid-19, the harms of gender dysphoria, and the opposition to a voice in Parliament are just a few examples.

 The legislation also carves out protections for the government, mainstream media, and ‘approved’ organisations. This protection extends to industries such as the big pharmaceutical companies that have a monopoly on patient information, health and medical practice. It creates an imbalance in the treatment of different voices and viewpoints. It undermines the principle of equality of speech. The imbalance reinforces a two-party political system at the expense of independent media and non-government political parties.

 The bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with draconian powers to silence the critics of the government, bureaucrats, medical and health authorities. It allows for fines of up to $6.8 million to be imposed on social media platforms if, in ACMA's opinion, they have not done enough to prevent the dissemination of what ACMA considers to be misinformation or disinformation. This creates a chilling effect on free expression and inhibits open dialogue. Prohibition of open dialogue has prevented Australians from hearing the debate between the proponents of the experimental and dangerous mRNA vaccines and those supporting the use of historically and scientifically proven safe and effective preventive and early treatments.

 Australians have died as a consequence of not having access to full, meaningful and informed consent about the vaccines. They also should have knowledge that the precautionary principle was excluded in the decision to experimentally vaccinate the world. Hence we have experienced the draconian and dangerous powers

## of the prohibition of free speech in health care and its tragic and deadly outcomes.

 Our government must safeguard the principles of freedom of speech and expression as cornerstones of Australian democracy, lest it be considered an undemocratic tyrannical institution. All individuals, organisations, media outlets, and political parties must
### be equally protected in exercising their right to free speech.

## A thorough review of the imbalance in protections provided to the mainstream media including the ABC needs to be conducted. The unfair and exclusionary behaviour of the mainstream media during the pandemic clearly exposed the current dysfunctional environment for open public discourse in health-care.

 Healthcare, as a critical sector, is responsible for the well-being of individuals, is inherently complex and requires a delicate balance between evidence-based practices, clinical experience and compassion. However, the phenomenon of fanaticism in healthcare has emerged, where individuals or groups display extreme and unwavering zeal in their pursuit of specific health ideologies or treatments, such as the exclusive use of antibiotics and vaccines in infectious disease. Fanaticism in healthcare can be chilling and deadly.

 The good doctors who wanted to practice ethically during the pandemic by providing meaningful, full and informed consent, were shut down by Ahpra and the medical board. They were prevented from looking after their patients. The public have no idea of this professional censorship and the prohibition of these doctors to prescribe life-saving vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. The public were told that ‘you might as well swallow lollies’ and ivermectin is ‘horse paste’. Quackery and charlatanism plentiful.

 These good doctors must be reinstated, rewarded and compensated and the government must apologise to them on behalf of itself, the mainstream media and the medical ‘authorities’.

## They have been the most truthful and intellectually honest of the profession. Only then the widespread misinformation and disinformation statements, claims and narratives of covid-19 will have been rightfully addressed.

 Members of Parliament must act in the best interests of upholding freedom of speech and protecting the individual rights of all Australians. This Bill poses a major threat to the freedom of speech
### in Australia and a further weakening of our ‘democracy’, one that
## suffers increasing corruption and the corrosion of our basic rights.

 The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is an affront to our way of life and must be rejected.

 Yours sincerely,

 Professor Ian Brighthope.
