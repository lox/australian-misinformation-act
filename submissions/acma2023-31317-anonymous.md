# Feedback submission for the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 My freedom of speech if extremely important to me. I will not lay down my god given rights.  I do not accept the premise that any government, or agent thereof, can restrain a personâ€™s freedom of speech to achieve anything morally good.

 Opposing voices and political discourse should not be censored to benefit any ruling party or align with a morality they decide upon.

 Any censorship of speech (be it digital censorship or any other form) will demote the concept of democracy and punishments associated with wrong speak will further demote any concept of a free society.

 Monitoring of citizens speech is an overstep of authoritarian power and should not be allowed by any government wishing to serve its people.

 Fact checking to an arbitrary standard (determined by the government of the time) will be one more wedge driven between a government and its people to create a larger gap.
