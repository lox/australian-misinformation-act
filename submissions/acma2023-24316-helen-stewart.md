# Submission re new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation:

## I am concerned by several aspects of this bill.

 Who determines what constitutes misinformation or disinformation?

 During the recent “pandemic” medical professionals who initially questioned the “safe and effective” mantra attached to the Covid19 vaccinations were labelled as misinformation / disinformation spreaders.

 It is now an accepted fact that the Covid19 vaccinations did not prevent transmission and did not prevent infection. The vaccines were therefore not effective.

 There is currently a class action in progress seeking compensation for the many victims of damage from Covid 19 vaccinations. The proponents of this class action are victims of the poor safety record of these vaccines.

 However, during the pandemic, anyone who questioned the safety of these vaccines was supposedly spreading misinformation or disinformation.

 Government authorities should never be the custodians of “the truth” because the “truth” is a very slippery concept. 

 The suggested use of fact checkers to carry out this task is pure censorship. 

 The immense fines proposed are obviously designed to create a culture of self censorship

 This proposal to allow ACMA new powers to combat misinformation and disinformation appears to me nothing but a blatant attempt by government to control the narrative and to feed the general public only the information the authorities deem acceptable. 

 Free speech is a core requirement of a healthy democracy and this bill would destroy that concept.
