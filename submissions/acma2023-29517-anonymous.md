Dear Sir/Madam,

I am wri�ng to express my grave concerns regarding the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment
(Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023. As an Australian ci�zen who values
democracy and free speech, I believe this bill poses a significant threat to our fundamental rights and
freedoms.

My primary objec�on is that the bill creates two �ers of free speech, gran�ng privileged status to
poli�cians, journalists and educators while restric�ng the rights of ordinary ci�zens. This is an affront
to equality under the law, and risks silencing valuable perspec�ves from outside of ins�tu�onal
power structures. Voices of lived experience must not be dismissed.

Moreover, the broad scope and harsh penal�es outlined in the bill could lead to increased selfcensorship out of fear. Determining truth is an imperfect process, and labeling dissen�ng views as
"misinforma�on" without adequate safeguards threatens open discourse. Even medical experts like
Dr Nick Coatsworth have warned that the prac�cal implementa�on of this bill could punish
poten�ally factual informa�on.

The bill's focus on major pla�orms also poses unintended risks to smaller community websites which
may be unaware of industry codes. Foreign site owners may face fines for non-compliance without
even knowing this Australian law exists. S�fling innova�on and global coopera�on is surely an
undesirable outcome.

This bill also fails to protect minority viewpoints which are essen�al for social progress. By
empowering a single "code" across all pla�orms, marginalized groups will lose refuge when
dominant narra�ves aim to silence them. This is a regression of hard-won rights.

Addi�onally, delega�ng legisla�ve authority to private companies to create "misinforma�on codes"
lacks parliamentary accountability. This is an improper abdica�on of democra�c responsibility.

Finally, the atmosphere of surveillance and threat of reputa�onal damage or fines directed at ci�zens
and companies could undermine Australian values like mateship, trust and cohesion.

In summary, I urge in the strongest terms that the Department reconsider the Communica�ons
Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023, which violates
free speech and equal treatment under the law. I hope you take these valid concerns into account
during the legisla�ve process. The rights and freedoms guaranteed under the UDHR and Australian
cons�tu�on must be upheld.

Thank you for your �me and considera�on.

Yours sincerely,
Concerned Australian Ci�zen –
