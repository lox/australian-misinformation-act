it is absolutely vital for any Democracy to allow free speech. For everyone to be able to state their
opinion or view ON ANY SUBJECT. If my statement then proves to be not true and it did any harm to
anyone, that is my own risk, and under the law that person might be able to take me to court for
that. How can you have a group of five or six people decide what is true and what is not, there are
many things that are only presumed to be true until much later it is proven to be false. Like the socalled fact that was presented to us Australians that the Vaccine prevents Transmission. Anyone that
would have said that it does not prevent transmission would have been fined.... The truth is
something that needs to be investigated by having debates about the subject. How can you have a
debate when you only allow one side of a story ? It is our constitutional right to practise free speech,
it would be illegal to censor that by trying to blackmail social Media companies with fines. We will
find other ways to communicate the Truth, even if our Government is trying really hard to silence
opposing voices.
