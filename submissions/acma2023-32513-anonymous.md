I am writing to oppose the proposed new ACMA powers, purportedly to "combat misinformation and
disinformation".

The proposed powers are dangerous and appear to be developed for abuse, to the extent that it is
unclear how such powers could even be proposed with good intentions.

Truth does not need to be protected from robust discussion, questioning, different opinions or even
opposing views. It is only lies that require protection from discussion, questions, different opinions
and especially from opposing views. So, for a government to implement such laws indicates that the
government is not seeking to do what is good and right for the Nation, and knows it. It indicates that
the government knows that its actions and narrative cannot stand scrutiny, discussion, or questions,
and must therefore be protected from these things, for fear of being exposed.

History has numerous examples of tyrannical ‘rulers’ stamping out any dissent, discussion, or
questioning, knowing that their actions and words will not stand in the presence of these – such
people are deluded to think that they could never be wrong, even mistaken, or ill-informed. This is
invariably to the detriment of the nations where such laws or practices apply.

I challenge you to find any example in history where such laws have been, or are, used for the good of
the nation in which they apply.

The absence of such laws in Australia (until now), has almost certainly caused Australia to be the envy
of countless people, many of whom seek to make their home in Australia as they flee from regimes
that already have similar laws to what is now being proposed in Australia.
