**Submission regarding the Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**

**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and all associated Amendments to the**

**Communications Act or Other Act Pertaining to these Changes**

To Whom It May Concern,

I write to you as a self-employed, hard-working contributor to the Australian way of life to advise
that I vehemently oppose this legislation and any such amendments to legislation that pertain to the
construct suggested by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and the Minister for
Communications, The Hon. Michelle Rowland MP.

This legislation is a dangerous and improper assault on the basic human right of free speech.

No Government or ‘Independent Body’ should have the power to decide what is ‘Disinformation’ or
‘Misinformation’. Hans Bredow’s 1926 and 1932 reforms made in Germany directly relating to state
control of communication modalities should act as a portend reminder as to how quickly such
legislation can be abused, regardless of the amendment’s original intentions.

Additionally, has the Minister and ACMA stopped to consider the flow on effect to the economy? By
removing the right of those who choose to question current understandings and share those queries
publicly to develop and improve on existing knowledge and provide better outcomes into the future
for our people and our country, how will progress be achieved? It is a totalitarian approach to the
sharing of information.

Instead of sulking in the corner like the popular kid who no one suddenly wants to talk to and
producing legislation that attempts to force respect, the ACMA and Minister would be far better
placed to work productively to ensure that mainstream pathways allow the equal sharing of
information from all sides of debate in a balanced manner that allows the people of Australia to
make informed decisions and choices. The behaviour of mainstream media (and Government
Officials) during Covid 19 in attempt to create an almost heretic division amongst the people of
Australia remained unchecked by the ACMA and will always be viewed by many as a failure in its
charter to ALL Australians.  Perhaps the ACMA and Minister would not be feeling so slighted had
they actively encouraged genuine debate over the last three years instead of attempting to stifle the
rights of everyday Australians to information that was legitimate, scientifically proven, and
internationally recognised and implemented.

Should this legislation in any form be introduced, it will further damage the integrity of the current
Government and will actively encourage Australians to look deeper into the greater intentions of this
organisation and what it stands for. Stifling free speech flies in the face of Democracy, Human Rights
and the Australian Constitution and goes against the Australian Governments ‘commitment to
protecting and promoting the traditional rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, opinion,
religion, association and movement’. This legislation is NOT a reasonable infringement on these
rights and goes beyond what is considered democratic.

Again, I DO NOT support this Legislation and any Amendments associated with the proposed
changes.

Yours Faithfully,

Shontae Moran

On this 17[th] Day of August 2023


Yours Faithfully,

Shontae Moran
