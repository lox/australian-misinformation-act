Forgive me while I lol. The Albanese government has presented to the Australian public
an Orwellian Bill of legislation George would feel proud of, not only for its proposed reach
and draconian control of the proper functioning of a free, just and proud society, but for the
audacious use of arrant misinformation to shape the discourse about
misinformation. There are so many levels of misinformation the ACMA, the Labor
government and the N&MRC are basing this nonsense on it is hard to know where to
start.

But, let us dive into what the premises of this document are based on.

1. That Australians are being subjected to "unprecedented" harmful and extraordinary
levels of misinformation.
2. That the truth is always known and the known truth cannot be questioned, nor
alternative truth be allowed to pollute the citizenrys' ears.
3. That the Australian public is unable to discern for itself what is and what is not true
4. That harm follows from misunderstanding truth, and that the harm is disabling to the
proper functioning of the nation
5. That the government apparatus (which includes ACMA) in modern, nay in all of
Australia’s federated history is the font of all truth and is able to judge fairly and truly in
every instance
6. That digital platforms equally, have any better claim to be able to judge what is truth and
what is not.

That’s enough to be going on with, but in case it is not clear, I would like to make sure that
the draftees of this bill know, that I think it is irredeemable and it should be consigned to
the scrap heap, never to arise again. Now to why I think that.

_1. The premise that Australians are being subjected to "unprecedented" harmful and_
_extraordinary levels of misinformation._
Lets define just what misinformation is, because the bill does not, nor does it define a
harm. And there lies the rub. If a term cannot be quantified, and it is arbitrarily up to a
body to make the decision on the behalf of a perhaps reluctant user, perhaps one that is
politically or socially divergent to the decision making body we have a problem, a big
problem. Is it the Labor governments intention to stifle free speech, and free speech,
because that’s exactly how it appears upon reading this legislation? Is a harm not feeling
like my ears have been petted well, or perhaps that a nasty word was used or is it
something more? Just on this one point this bill must fail.
Further, just what is misinformation? Here’s the definition provided in the bill;
Misinformation is online content that is false, misleading or deceptive, that is shared or created
without an intent to deceive but can cause and contribute to serious harm.
Fair enough. But what if todays mainstream accepted information is incomplete, or
erroneous in the first place? What if others have better information even today? Are they
not to be heard and their information tested against the current paradigm? Which leads
me to point 2 and 5.

_2.That the truth is always known and the known truth cannot be questioned, nor alternative_
_truth be allowed to pollute the citizenrys' ears._
_5. That the government apparatus (which includes ACMA) in modern, nay in all of_
_Australia’s federated history is the font of all truth and is able to judge fairly and truly in_
_every instance_

Just in one edition of one weekend newspaper we have several articles pointing to the
**truth finally being allowed to emerge dusty and unwillingly, blinking into the light. Many of**
the Australian public were screaming loudly, but seemingly uselessly into the ether, trying
desperately to get the rest of the general public to at least hear our pleas for common
sense, proper scientific debate and reason to at least know that ALL of the measures being
touted by both federal and state governments against a relatively harmless disease were
at best useless, and most likely were more harmful than the disease. There was ample
evidence, with ample numbers of eminently qualified people able to talk calmly and
reasonably about that evidence. They were quietly censored, BY OUR GOVERNMENT,
aided and abetted by the social media platforms. Indeed, this is still going on. A majority
of our deluded public do not know that all cause mortality did not increase in 2020, when
apparently this most deadly disease hit our shores, nor did it rise markedly until mass
“vaccination” was practised upon an unsuspecting, uninformed and therefore non
consensual target population. Since then, all cause mortality has risen alarmingly,
hospitalisation likewise, presumably for a variety of reasons, from increased susceptibility
to respiratory diseases and more insidiously “turbo” cancers, heart disease (shockingly
high numbers of young fit people), nerve issues, the list is extensive, worrying and a horrid
indictment on the medical and government professionals who have, and still do promote
an unsafe ineffective injection.

Those of us who had well founded fears as to the safety of these injections feel somewhat
comforted now, that at least we had some chance of reaching the ears and eyes of an
unsuspecting public. The Misinformation Bill as presented would scotch all chance of that
happening, as vested interests, with big wallets would make sure all contrary information
was squashed at source, never to see the light of day, with the imprimatur of being
Government endorsed.

So to the question of the probity of the governments we have, and have had, here in
Australia. Have our various administrations always been hand on heart truthful with us,
the paying public? Well, history is a funny thing isn’t it? I’ll just reel of a few porkies,
starting with perhaps the most relevant, the Thalidomide debacle, where hundreds of
innocent children and their parents were disabled or killed because our federal
government once again was slow to react, did not listen to concerned and qualified experts
who rang the warning bells early, and continued to allow this drug to be available. They,
the government of the day effectively lied.

But what else has the government either been wrong about and covered up, or actively
lied about? Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq anyone? Or maybe Robodebt, or
maybe the Pink Batts Scheme or the White Australia Policy. All terrible policies, with awful
results, and misinformation or disinformation provided by both politicians and/or the public
service and other invested parties. My point being, there is no one font of all knowledge,
not education providers, media, or Government, that truth comes when open and
respectful debate occurs, when all parts of an argument can be shared and heard.

_3. That the Australian public is unable to discern for itself what is and what is not true_

Much of the justification for the Labor governments and ACMAs claims about the “harms”
of misinformation and disinformation stem from the University Canberra N&MRC survey
and focus group study commissioned by ACMA. The study has a number of flaws, chiefly
that the participants were very skewed towards a particular cohort of highly educated,
Canberra dwellers whose sources of information over the 2020-2021 period studied were
quite limited. The majority were sourcing much of their information from “government
approved” sources, such as ABC, government websites and Meta platforms. Lets be
honest, the government was actively encouraging, sometimes financially, the larger social
media platforms to censor non government approved viewpoints and to enhance the
government messages. Even with this severe bias, the vast majority (78%) of participants
agreed that individuals should use common sense and learn to detect false or misleading
information themselves. Information provided in a vacuum with no opposing debate does
not allow for people to determine for themselves what is truth and what is not.

_4. That harm follows from misunderstanding truth, and that the harm is disabling to the_
_proper functioning of the nation_

The draft legislation does not adequately define what a harm is. There is no quanitifcation.
Whilst motherhood statements such as:
“harm means any of the following:
8 (a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of
9 ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age,
10 religion or physical or mental disability;
11 (b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;
12 (c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of
13 Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government
14 institutions;
15 (d) harm to the health of Australians;
16 (e) harm to the Australian environment;
17 (f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian

18 economy or a sector of the Australian economy.”

None of these “harms” are quantified, leaving the interpretation open to the censors and
others. A harm could be as large as inciting mass riots, or to distributing a leaflet that one
person finds slightly disturbing. This is not how a properly operating democratic and open
society can thrive. A society that can debate wildly divergent theories in a respectful
manner, hearing all points, and mustering valid arguments to counter, is one that is
inclusive of all, diverse and stable. Conversely a nation that routinely uses censorship,
squashes debate and silences opposition is more commonly known as a totalitarian
dictatorship, not something that the vast majority of Australians have any desire to see
happen in our nation.

_6. That digital platforms equally, have any better claim to be able to judge what is truth and_
_what is not._

All humans err. Even AI errs. No one human or a committee of humans ever know the
truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. When vested interests are allowed to
intervene in the “truth telling” the truth finds itself in an even murkier lair. The Australian
public can have no faith in the faceless fact checkers employed by huge international
digital platforms. Recent revelations in the US Congress hearings re Twitter files,
revelations in Australia on a similar theme, withholding of vital information requested
through legal FOI for all manner of information re the Government Covid response give us
little comfort that this legislation is designed to help the public, and leads to a suspicion
that it is more about aiding organisations and government to cover up misfeasance and
malfeasance.

In conclusion, I ask all parliamentarians to contemplate the words of two great truth tellers:

“I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet
any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.”

Abraham Lincoln

“All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover
them.”

Galileo Galilei

and to have faith in the commonsense of the Australian public when presented with
contrarian information to discern for themselves what is truth. I urge all representatives to
vote down this attempt to silence the Australian public.
