<html><head></head><body>I oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.&nbsp;<div>The reasons for my
opposition are that:</div><div><br></div><div>It has no place in a reall democracy where freedom
of speech should be protected;</div><div><br></div><div>The arbiters of the meaning of the terms
misinformation, disinformation and harm, are the
government.</div><div><br></div><div>Resrictions on freedom of speech imposed by this bill do
not apply to the government.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The government is seeking to give
itself the power to regulate what it determines to be True.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the
type of legislation we saw in Stalinist Russia and has no place in a
democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Best wishes</div><div><br></div><div>Peter
