I am deeply concerned about the new New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation. They are 
The bill states that the AMCA is not arbiter of truth, then who is?

Who decides what is true and how?

When and where will the guidelines for truth be posted?

This bill will trample an individuals right to research and share what they believe to be true. Where
is the respect for a persons right for independent research and critical thinking.

This bill lumps misinformation and disinformation together, when by definition they are the very
different things.

Where is the independent oversight?

I equate the powers in this new bill to book burning under Totalitarian, fascist and dictator
government.

Free speech is the bedrock of democracy. Without it you have a dictatorship. I am shocked that
an Australian democracy would consider this bill. It is unAustralian.

This bill also seeks to stop sharing information about public protest, again a citizen right to protect
is fundamental to democracy. To erode the right to protest, or arrange protest is to silence a
Nations citizens.

This bill also seeks to stop harm through harmful content. The example given is the
“Misinformation that caused people to ingest or inject products to treat a viral infection. By the
bill’s own definition this example should be exempt. The suggestion was made by a government
official, in this case the President of the United States. It was broadcast by the professional news.
It was also produced in the USA, so should not apply to Australia. The fact that the bill has used
this example, shows the bill has not been thoroughly examined.

Under the definition of harm, the author of the information is considered. This should not be a
factor. The information should be independent of the the author. People are and do hold a variety
of opinions. To blacklisted authors is to erode freedom of speech, especially by independent
journalists.

If this bill is to contain information and disinformation, everyone should be equally persecuted. No
government, education institution or news source should be exempt. All have spread
misinformation and disinformation.

In this bill it says that personal message will not be targeted, yet organisations are required to
keep records of personal messages. Individuals if summonsed are required to product
information, it seems without limits.

Policing of digital platforms, content and search engines will drive the sharing of information
underground. The government will be directly responsible for this. Such severe policing may also
force services to abandon Australia.

It is plausible to think that this bill exists for people to censor themselves, a destruction of the
right of freedom of expression. The right of expression not only exists for that of the speaker, but
that of the listener.
