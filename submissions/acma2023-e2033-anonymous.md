I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law. This is an extremely dangerous proposed bill which
would lead this nation 'down the road' to totalitarianism. Freedom of Speech is the bedrock of a free, open and democratic
society, such as we have in Australua. This must be maintained and vigorously protected. Please do not support this agregious,
anti-freedom proposed bill...for the sake of the future of our nation!!!!

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a violation of
Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how unelected
bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

Please reject this bill.
