The trouble with this sort of legislation is that it is like standing in the rain trying to catch rainwater in
a sieve; you won't get the results you want, but you will get wet.

This legislation will try to turn the ACMA into the Arbiter of Truth, perhaps like George Orwell’s
“Ministry of Truth” in 1984. It will be people in ACMA who will determine what content is
true/harmless and what content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive.

But people are fallible. They have a frame of reference through which they view the world, they
have a political view, prejudices, some even have agendas, but most of all they don’t know all the
information on everything they are called to judge upon. They are fallible.

We have a few very good examples of the fallibility of people. Take for example the “Wuhan lab leak
theory”. The Wuhan lab leak theory was dismissed as disinformation for a couple of years, but now
the FBI and the US Energy Department both agree that the most likely origin of Covid-19 is a lab leak
from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

And then there are things covered up for political reasons. Take for example “Hunter Biden’s laptop”.
Yes, it is a United States issue, but the potential for that sort of thing to happen here should not be
disregarded.

Sometimes, things labelled as disinformation turns out to be the truth, but this is not my biggest
concern.

One of the first things a totalitarian regime will do, is to take control of what information is
acceptable to disseminate and what is not. This legislation has the potential to open a Pandora’s Box
of censorship. It is a way where some people can say stuff and others can be silenced; there a
specific agenda can be elevated, and another point of view can be suppressed.

I never want to see an Australia become a place where the propaganda of postmodernist political
activists are triumphant over free speech and this legislation makes this outcome considerably more
probable.
