To whom it may concern,

(Regarding the draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023. )

I am deeply concerned about this move to counter misinformation and disinformation in social
media. It gives to much opportunity to restrict freedom of speech, and to do so from the perspective
of the ruling culture or the dominant culture. Who decides what is classified as disinformation and
misinformation, especially in a divernse multicultural society? Governments and their
“independent” organisations like ACMA, should be encouraging free and open dialogue within the
social community and allow the community to engage in the struggle of ideas. We do not need a
government or any so called independent body to paternalistically decide our ideas for us. We
already have systems of law and policing that are set up to deal with practices that are overtly and
universally regarded as dangerous and highly immoral. (Child abuse, slavery, terrorism, etc.) We do
not need our ideas policed. This is not 1984. The goal of government is not to control people and
ideas, but rather assist people and encourage thoughtful and considerate dialogue on issues.

I strongly oppose any attempts to increase the ppower of ACMA in the way that this draft bill is
being expressed.

Regards
Kim Roberts
