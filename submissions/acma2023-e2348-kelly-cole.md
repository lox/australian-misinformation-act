SUBMISSION

### The proposal to censor democracy is a contradiction in terms. It is frightening that this erosion of rights is even under consideration. What is even more frightening and even totalitarian is that the government itself is exempt. That government espouses the one and only "truth" is dictatorial at least and limitless in its reach, at best. The world has historically witnessed such suppression and I am not afraid to say this proposed bill reeks of nazi-ism. Anyone who supports this move to have a small group of government selected non-entity censors dictate "truth" to Australians needs to be held to account for the part they play in destroying Australia, the country WE ALL belong to and have built, paid for and died for along with our hard working ancestors for the very freedoms now under serious threat. This bill is a shameful proposal which regresses Australians to the dark ages and treats its citizens like errant infants.
