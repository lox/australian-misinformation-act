# SECRET INFO WAR: BATTLE TO MISLEAD AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC


### In the writing of this submission it became apparent that a threat far greater in scale and intensity, than any threat articulated or implied in the legislation, was currently active in the available information space of Australians.

 The threat discovered is not the illusionary or speculative outline of a possible threat we've been presented in this legislation, it is an actual, active and admitted information war operation being conducted by the UK Ministry of Defence, its scope and doctrine articulated in the document included as an attachment to this submission and titled - Integrated Operating Concept 2021

 The document leaves no doubt as to the seriousness and resources the UK are expending in their perceived information war. The document also details the actions and responses they expect to take in order to win this conflict.

 The points of particular concern for Australia and the Australian public are;
 1. the stated goals of this information war are the advancement of the interests of the UK (and US) and the suppression of any information that threatens those interests.

 2. the inclusion of the public as adversaries, due to a perception the public has been exposed to rival influences. Requiring the public to be subjected to continual information operations designed to drown out rival influence and reinforce UK (US) interests.

 3. The self evident fact that Australia has interests of its own, which may include from time to time, interests that may conflict with the interests of our partners. For example, the interests of our partners in threatening China to the level of armed conflict or war. China being Australia's biggest export destination representing 40% of total exports. The proximal region of any armed conflict with China encompassing 4 of Australia's top 5 export destinations (China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan). Clearly Australia's interests have diverged to a large degree with our partners on the issue of China. Anyone presented these facts would conclude armed conflict with China involving our partners is likely to be catastrophic to Australia's economy and the future well being of all Australians.

 4. The high degree of influence that our much larger partners, the US and UK,


-----

### wield over the totality of the English language information space, which forms a large part of the information space available to Australians. The degree of US and UK influence is often hidden by being distributed in its original form by Australian branded outlets.

 The existence of a secret information war impacting the information space available to Australians is a serious matter and one that remains wholly absent from consideration in relation to this legislation. This submission presents many detailed arguments proving that this suppression of Australia's interests represents an existential threat to the nation and the Australian public – the largest threat since the threat of Japan and the actions of Prime Minister John Curtin re-aligning Australian interests away from those of the UK in 1942.

 Instead we are presented with this legislation which through gross incompetence or deliberate deception never acknowledges this vast misinformation/disinformation influence. Instead we are presented with an ill conceived and wholly inadequate assessment that mis-attributes the alleged threat back to a subset of the Australian public instead. The entire framework of regulatory compliance and legislation being based on policing individuals sharing content deemed misinformation and disinformation.

 The proposed legislation needs to be rejected and a re-direction of legislative efforts to protecting Australia from the threat represented by our US and US partners – their information war against Australian interests and the catastrophic consequences facing our nation should they be successful in once again ensuring Australia act against its own interests by aligning with theirs (US/UK).

 Bravery and transparent acknowledgement of fact are required to counter this existential threat to Australia's interests and hence the future prosperity and well being of the Australian public. Bravery because this will involve actions our partners will not like. Transparency because our government and our partners' are addicted to secrecy and routinely drown important issues with secrecy barriers to stop public debate.

 With these qualities being wholly absent in the advancement of this malevolent legislation, this submission will attempt to redress this by presenting facts and reasoned, logical arguments in the fervent hope that others in positions of influence can be awakened to the danger and take action to protect our future interests.

### Legislation title invokes information war, are we at war?


The title of this legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation” makes
clear that those who are invested in its' advancement and drafting see it as a
weapon in what they perceive is an information war. They are pretending that a
subset of the public and their foreign adversaries threaten harm to the Australian
public with misinformation and disinformation. In acting out this pretence they want
us to ignore the vast scale and volume of misinformation and disinformation their
partners in the Anglo American establishment are pumping into the information
space available to the Australian public.

In fact our UK partners Ministry of Defence state that they are engaged in a silent
information war already. From their description it may be silent, but it is vast and has
no boundaries. They will also stop at nothing to win.

So, all this begs a big question – Is Australia engaged in a silent info war as well?
Googling “Australia” AND “Information war” certainly brings up a lot of info from
each of our military services and their brand of IW. No publication as overt as the
MOD UK one, maybe it isn't as easily found...

Certainly in terms of the latest concepts in military thinking, various forms of non
kinetic war can include hybrid conflicts including those that act in the information
space. Therefore the concept of Australia being engaged in an information war
either now or in the future is plausible.

The concern for the Australian public is who exactly is who in this war. The UK MOD
sees everyone as an adversary. Is anyone acting in the interests of the Australian
public?

Why is there no acknowledgement, treatment or debate about this fact in
relation to the proposed legislation?

Later this submission will provide evidence that shows our partners are losing their
long standing global dominance and are in decline militarily and economically. That
the vast information operation is in all likelihood one aimed wholly to ensure these
truths are suppressed from the public. In fact, along with this legislation it appears
that our partners are increasingly targeting their own public as their global
dominance reduces.


### UK Ministry of Defence: we are at war, you the public are our adversary


Yes, the UK Ministry of Defence have really spilled the beans and exposed exactly
who is behind this legislation, who the target is and what the legislation will enable
and what we can expect to happen if this legislation passes.


-----

We can get an idea of how the Anglo American establishment views current and
future warfare via their agent the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) publication
`Integrated Operating Concept [1] - it is a real eye opener.

### Old distinctions between ‘peace’ and ‘war’, between ‘public’ and ‘private’, between ‘foreign’ and ‘domestic’ and between ‘state’ and ‘non-state’ are increasingly out of date.

Well whoever wrote this has really let the rabid dogs off the leash. Once upon a time
the military were excluded from acting in civilian life except in an actual war. This
throws that concept in the bin. Along with every other limit, exclusion or exception
on military action. Clearly our Anglo American establishment elite folks are highly
agitated and have effectively removed all restrictions from their military so they can
suppress dissent, disagreement, criticism or any other threat they may perceive.

It presents further proof that the Australian public are subjected to vast quantities of
government disinfo/misinfo 24/7 precisely because there are none of the traditional
distinctions.

Once this is understood old thought patterns such as `they would never' or `I don't
believe it would be allowed...' or `no, our taxes pay for that and...” should cease in
favour of understanding that we, the Australian public are seen as the potential
adversary at all times, unless we are subjected to massive information control and
appear to comply and align our opinions with it,

The only conclusion that can really be made by the inflammatory statements
contained in the current military posture of the nations forming or partnered with the
Anglo American establishment - The Australian public are seen as potential
adversaries requiring constant influence operations reinforcing approved
narratives and concepts that advance Anglo American establishment ideas. If
the info matrix pauses for a moment the Defence protocol assumes the
Australian public will be influenced by hostile information that acts against
those interests. We never imagined we would get a bullet in the head for
sharing memes, but here we are.

### Politics no longer off limits to military


More from the Ministry of Defence;

### Our authoritarian rivals see the strategic context as a continuous struggle in which non-military and military instruments are used unconstrained by any distinction between peace and war. These regimes believe that they are already engaged in an intense form of conflict that is predominantly political

### rather than military. Their strategy of ‘political warfare’ is designed to undermine cohesion, to erode economic, political and social resilience, and to compete for strategic advantage in key regions of the world.

Use of terms like resilience gives this document away as globalist driven Anglo
American establishment bankrolled way of justifying a lurch to authoritarian
fascism. The target is very transparently the general public...

In case you are thinking this is parody, you can find this document here;

It is telling and predictable that the MOD determines this as a continuous struggle.
Continuous struggles require ever increasing budgets and never repealed loss of
freedom and privacy for the public. No conflict of interest there.

In fact the conflict of interest is one in permanent conflict with the PUBLIC'S interest.
But as this submission will show, the public's interest is no longer of any
concern to those advancing this legislation and presumably partnered with
those responsible for the Defence publication.

Also rather shocking is the MOD's determination that their adversaries [2] are
engaged in political warfare. This of course allows the defence establishment already
off their leashes to maul political candidates. Whereas it is traditionally assumed that
Defence stayed out of politics, now it sees politics as just another battlefield upon
which to engage in combat.

Given that the Anglo American establishment has already weaponized politics,
starting in 2017 when war was declared on the unapproved candidate winning the
US Presidency. It would appear they have just formalised the fact they will eliminate
any political candidate whose policies they don't like [3].

### Beware peacemakers military sees you as existential threat


Obviously any member of the public advocating for peace, let alone political
candidate is  now, according to current military thinking, seen as an existential threat
because we are in an undeclared war without boundaries. While as yet we are unsure

_Australian public_

3 UK opposition leader and peace advocate Jeremy Corbyn was removed as part of a sophisticated and likely a joint
operation between MI6, MOD, Mossad and Swedish intel (who partnered previously to entangle Julian Assange in
trumped up allegations of non consensual sex). Corbyn was approached (set up) by a stranger in Sweden for a selfie
and obliged. Later the selfie was leaked to the press and Corbyn urged to resign due to the anti Semitic publication
and speeches of the man he was pictured with. A large number of politicians on both sides of the house had been
recruited to a UK/US security foundation, they were activated to call for Corbyn's resignation, which he did.

of the fate awaiting the dangerous peacemakers, presumably warmongers and those
thirsty for blood will be welcomed and assisted in every manner possible to win
office.

Public interest and freedoms are collateral damage The UK MOD helpfully explains
and contextualises the role of the proposed legislation in undermining our very
freedoms.

### Their goal is to win without fighting: to achieve their objectives by breaking our willpower, using attacks below the threshold that would prompt a war- fighting response. These attacks on our way of life, from assertive authoritarian rivals and extremist ideologies, are remarkably difficult to defeat without undermining the very freedoms we want to protect. We are exposed through our openness.

Our freedoms and our privacy are nothing but `collateral damage' in their struggle to
maintain UK (US) interests. How does this legislation and its narrow focus expect to
be taken seriously in light of this information?


### Paranoid Anglo American establishment has many ways to will destroy you


Dropping any pretence of civility we have this list of all the ways those deemed
threats will be subjected to, via the information space but clearly using kinetic `meat
space' acts of violence also.

In many ways, this document exposes the level of sinister threat and coercion the
Anglo American establishment has deployed covertly across the world to further
their interests. Previously such flexing of threatened capability was kept hidden from
the public and used diplomatically or whispered to leaders of smaller nations who
had ideas of sovereignty or of pursuing the best interests of their fellow country folk.
But now in 2023 unable to get their way globally, they will use it on the public
instead.

### The triumph of the narrative increasingly determines defeat or victory and hence the importance of information operations. They can be used to support conventional military operations and those utilising proxies and deniable para-military forces, military coercion, offensive cyber operations, and of course lawfare. Established techniques, such as assassination, deception, economic coercion, espionage, theft of intellectual property and subversion gain potency through the clever use of cyber, digitised information and social media. Psychological insights into how these channels can be manipulated enhance their effectiveness. 


-----

The paragraph above should confirm the level of psychopathy we are dealing with.
With our English speaking partners (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)
representing just 12.5% of the worlds population, is it any wonder the other 87.5%
are running for the BRICS exits to get as far from these people as possible?

Now that the general public are deemed adversaries until they've proven they are
brainwashed by state propaganda, it is only fair and sporting that they reveal the
type of combat they will use on us if we refuse the indoctrination. It should be noted
the MOD is fast tracking their increase of capability in info warfare.

### Britain’s first dedicated cyber regiment has been officially established as part of the Army’s response to the digital threat posed by potential adversaries. Creation of 13th Signals Regiment, part of restructuring of the British Army, known as Army 2020 Refine, includes the creation of a division conducting cyber, electronic warfare, intelligence, information operations and unconventional warfare. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the move was “a modernisation of the UK armed forces for information warfare. we must prepare to defend ourselves from all those who would do us harm, and 13th Signal Regiment is a vital addition to that defense.”
 Defense News June 5[th] 2020

Having also now cleared up any uncertainty, members of the public advocating for
peace rather than war, particularly if running for public office should expect to be
thoroughly cyber stalked by 13[th] Signal Regiment whose full spectrum surveillance
will allow relatively easy planning for assassination, subjection to economic coercion
or simply law-fared into bankruptcy (ie tied up with completely fake and unfounded
but complex and financially draining legal proceedings).

Peace activists, anti vaxxers, anti royalists or anyone holding opinions that are
counter establishment are now seen as adversaries of the Anglo American
establishment. You have been, apparently, now duly warned!.


### This legislation appears driven by this dangerous undemocratic info war mentality


This legislation is driven by a war mentality and is a weapon against the public, free
speech, open debate and the sharing of information. Because according to these
people everything is a battlefield and we are all adversaries until we exhibit
compliance with the propaganda they are swamping us with.

Frankly, the Australian public would be justified in judging the authors of the
document as dangerous paranoid psychopaths requiring urgent medical attention.

### Evidence of military manipulation in information space – disinfo on Italy and BRI

The following article [4] appeared on the ABC (Australia) News site on 8[th] August
2023. It concerns Italy and the article will have largely been lifted with minimal
editing from the Reuters foreign news stream (Reuters has a long history of being the
Anglo American establishment's international propaganda service).

The article concerns the fact that Italy
signed on with the China driven BRI belt
and road initiative in 2019. Presumably
both parties acknowledged the role of
Venice in centuries past as the end of the
old silk road and consequently Venice
became the wealthiest trading hub in
Europe for a century and a half as it took a
cut from the high demand across Europe
for the exotic goods arriving from the
orient.

It is well established and easily referenced with open source content that Italy's
relationship with China is seen as unacceptable in many establishment quarters.
Given the Anglo American establishment orientation that sees both Russia and
China as existential threats to their continued hegemony and dominance across the
globe, Italy's participation has been an irritant and an issue to which Italian
politicians have been subjected to increasing pressure to cancel.

The above article is a perfect example of purely misleading content that performs
no purpose except as propaganda. Here are the key aspects that make it so;
1. The article provides no context to its reporting
2. Nor does it offer a balanced report that discusses both for and against
arguments.

3. The article has very little actual newsworthiness
4. At its core are two quotes with no info as to where and when they were made
5. Italian Defence Minister quoted, not PM – hardly a newsworthy figure
6. Article provides one other source also critical of deal, anonymously attributed as
`critics'

The unnamed critics provide the view that the BRI is a tool to spread China's
geopolitical and economic influence.

Regardless of ones views about China and whether their BRI initiative represents the
investment in infrastructure that the Anglo American establishment had the
opportunity to do for over 200 years and failed to do, or is as the critics describe –
this article on the ABC News site provides the Australian public with only the

-----

negative.

With no balance and no context the article becomes simply propaganda. Ordinarily
the Italian Defence Minister would almost never be found newsworthy for
Australians, it's not possible to find any previous articles only quoting the Defence
Minister. A simple google compound search combining the word “Italy” AND “BRI”
reveals that the Reuters propaganda article has been carried by many media outlets
around the world. Extraordinary that a piece of non news featuring comments by not
even the head of state of a small EU nation gets this much coverage.

Obviously, with no actual source except Reuters to go on, it is only possible to
speculate. However the article has been generated as a result of the Italian Defence
Minister making certain statements, to whom or under what circumstances are not
mentioned. Given that the MOD UK are engaged in a silent info war, it is plausible if
not likely that the source of this article was the UK military, for example 77[th] Brigade
who specialise in information operations.
Being military it would be relatively easy to arrange for the Italian Defence Minister,
who is presumably warm with the MOD UK to make some pre-arranged statements
that could be then reported and spread internationally.

The purpose? To continue overt pressure on the Italian Government to end the deal
and misinform, disinform the public in many countries about the BRI and present a
one sided argument that it is an awful deal for Italy (with no details or evidence of
the deals merits or otherwise).

This is a good example of the current levels of contamination the Australian public
finds in their available information space. One sided, context free reporting of likely
staged commentary from the Italian Defence Minister as well as other evidence-free
assertions that lack any attribution apart from as `critics'.

Pure disinformation and propaganda likely generated by the MOD UK to further the
interests of the Anglo American establishment and mislead the Australian
public...one tiny component of a much larger information operation to manipulate
public opinion into supporting a war with China.

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 1 of 93**


# 1. FOREWARD TO THIS SUBMISSION


The fundamental assertion behind this proposed legislation is a series of statements
found in factsheets and online that more or less state that;

### the `issue' of misinformation and disinformation represents a threat that risks harming or can pose a risk to the health and safety of the Australian public and or cause confusion and undermine trust inour democratic institutions and government.

All suggestive of noble intentions to protect us all. However without credible
supporting evidence these assertions and allegations are of no importance or
significance at all. They can as likely be just a quorum of like minded opinion as a
meaningless string of important sounding words as some early and untested working
hypotheses or simply `wild conspiracy theories.

Certainly in the course of compiling this submission, nothing approaching credible
evidence was found in the supporting documentation for this legislation.

And so at this early stage what are we left with?
We are left with a central assertion as to the importance, urgency etc of the `issue'
(misinformation and disinformation) along with unsubstantiated serious allegations
provided by unknown sources. Yet this entire project has risen and been given priority,
funding presumably, had papers and reports written and legislation drafted.

Is this normal? Because it really does seem like an incredibly thin premise, lacking in
actual data or evidence that has been rewarded with a significant level of resources to
advance it...

After compiling over 90 pages of submission in response to this legislation, it would
appear that this document represents at least 50 times more substance and plausible
argument than what has been publicly presented in support of this legislation.

We already know there is no genuine care for the public here or serious intent in
relation to misinformation and disinformation. How? Because, without anything
approaching an adequate explanation, those parties responsible for pushing and
drafting the proposed legislation have exempted government and media from any
compliance – If they aren't in the business of creating and distributing misinformation
and disinformation - why do they need exemption?

Indeed! In fact, this submission was originally a much shorter document with a series of
easy arguments showing the legislation's framing made its real purpose far from its
stated intent. As well as taking easy aim at the ridiculously thin supporting
documentation from ACMA containing as it does, nothing more than worthless,
unsupported opinions and falsely obtained assumptions. In short both the legislation
andthesupportingmaterialareaworthlessandbin-worthyeffort.

**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 2 of 93**

### However, in compiling this submission in response to the proposed legislation, it became evident that there are powerful forces already impacting, suppressing and manipulating the information space available to the Australian public. These forces emanate from the military and intelligence areas, in the government service of our partners the US and UK. Curiously, with the resources and time ACMA spent investigating and researching this issue, the existence of this rather largest influence has either been inadvertantly or quite deliberately missed.

As the largest English language nations, it follows that content originating from the US
and UK will be highly influential in the information space available to the Australian
public. It was however most unexpected to discover that the UK and likely the US also,
have articulated in publicly available Ministry of Defence documents that they are
engaged in a full spectrum information war .

This submission has included the document as an attachment. It makes a sobering read.
It also raises many questions about this proposed legislation which really does appear
redundant if not, then extremely deceptive in its framing and intent. Has this legislation
in fact been promoted and drafted by elements connected with our defence or
intelligence establishment? Has it been promoted deceptively? Who in government
knows that our available information space is actually a battle-space where the MOD UK
and their full spectrum information war are battling for narrative supremacy?

Given the lack of information or acknowledgement of this fact this submission has
required significant expansion to explain who and what are involved, why this happening
and what the likely outcomes are –

As a result this submission now provides a horizon to horizon view of Australia's place in
the world, the real activity of our US and UK partners since the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991, why they are in an accelerating state of collapse now themselves, why
they are engaging in information warfare ostensibly against adversary states but actually
targeting their own public, how the information war is playing out right now and
affecting a huge proportion of content within our available information space and where
this headed and the likely outcomes – once again none good for Australia unless big
changes take place.

These issues go the very core of Australia's sovereignty and how Australia's interests, in
particular our economic interests have fundamentally and irrecoverably diverged from
those of our long standing US and UK partners. However with both our partners
engaged in information warfare so as to protect and advance their own interests, our
own Australian interests are in danger of suppression and being being overwhelmed. In
short any Australian interests that do not align with US and UK interests are viewed as a
threat.

The information presented in this submission is easily found and publicly available. The
information proving our interests have fundamentally diverged from our US and UK

partners will shock readers. If you are shocked, then it will seem to indicate that this
information is likely being suppressed or overwhelmed by other information that
advocates other actions that align with our US and UK partners interests instead.

### Content focusing on Australia's best interests is by their definition content that threatens the interest of the US and UK. As a result it will be targeted for suppression as part of the silent information war.

In fact the threat facing Australia right now from this information war and its goal of
propagandising and indoctrinating the Australian public together with subversion of
Australia's best interests in favour of the interests of the US and UK – is existential in
scale and likely the most serious threat to us since World War 2.

### Considering the scale and implications of the issues covered in this submission, all of which are crucially related back to the information space available to us, the proposed legislation is an inadequate, poorly framed attempt to finger foreigners and the Australian people as info criminals for sharing memes, while pretending the vast information operation being conducted on us by the US and UK military doesn't exist*

*maybe someone will go so far as to say it's a conspiracy theory, to avoid
embarrassment they should read the MOD document in attachment A.


### 1.1 Threat to Australia from a silent war on information


Australia faces an existential threat to its economic viability and the continued
living standards and well being of its people. At this time, the threat is in the form of a
silent war being conducted in the information space available to the Australian public.
The threat we face will not stay silent, there is much co-ordination and energy being
devoted to ensure we move to engage in actual armed conflict. But, at this time, the
threat to Australia is confined to the information sphere.

### Contrary to the assertions and assumptions that are driving this deeply flawed and malevolent legislation, The Australian public are being subjected to an unprecedented, vast and continuous stream of deeply manipulated and propagandised (mostly) English language information streams emanating from the UK and US.

This is part of a fully articulated information war strategy, uncovered in this submission,
currently being fought by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD UK) and presumably by the
US military also. The MOD UK document included in this submission makes clear that
the UK is devoting significant resources to winning the battle of narratives in the
information war, so as to advance the interests of the UK.

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 4 of 93**

Couched as describing the actions of `our rivals' the document implicitly outlines the
actions and strategies that will be used to engage them. For example all prior barriers
and limits placed on military intrusions on civilian peacetime activities and society at
large – are specifically removed.

Furthermore, it is implicit that the civilian public are considered adversaries, due to their
belief that we will have already been exposed to rival influence campaigns. They believe
we, the public will require continual exposure to `friendly' information that furthers US
and UK interests and that we remain adversaries until we show our indoctrination by
sharing their propagandised information.

It's all very dystopian and sadly all too real.


### 1.2 Legislation needs debate and transparency about state info war ops


The significance and relevance of a vast, systemic and militarised intervention to
manipulate and propagandise the available information space of the Australian public, is
central to any debate about the proposed legislation. Strangely for legislation that uses
such militarised language as `combatting' in its title, there is no indication or
acknowledgement of the existence of this information war.

Placed in perspective against the picture painted by the MOD document, this legislation
is the equivalent of thinking a single strip of blue tack is adequate to protect your home
from a 100 year flood. Ridiculous yes, but also ill conceived and very dangerous.

The submission provides examples of media reporting about specific Army units
assigned roles in information warfare operations and an article which looks to be the
product of such operations, including one from the ABC Australia news site, proving the
information space available to Australians is already subject to these misinformation and
propaganda operations.


### 1.3 Legislation exempts government and media from compliance – why?


The information war the UK MOD document describes is not referenced or
acknowledged in the documentation made available supporting the legislation.

While they may have missed the existence of the information war, they haven't missed
the opportunity to exempt government and media from compliance. There doesn't
appear to be any reasons given for this, although seen in the perspective provided by
this submission, there should be detailed and public explanation as to why..

This submission builds the strong case that this legislation has been advanced and
promoted by largely the same elements engaging in information warfare. This legislation
is intended as another weapon to add to their armoury. Those most likely to be the
victims of this weapon, in fact of the information war in general are the public. The intent
and aim is the suppression and elimination of information, debate, argument and
opinion that poses a threat to the interests of the US and UK.

**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 5 of 93**

This includes debate and promotion of Australia's interests, particularly where they
diverge from those of our US and UK partners. Is it normal to be advancing legislation
that will have the effect of subverting Australia's interests? Nothing is surprising these
days. No-one fears Treason Laws any more as no-one has the guts to charge anyone for
it.


### 1.4 Our leaders only pursue Australian interests if open debate shows public support


This submission goes into some detail in describing Australia's place in the world but in
relation to our long standing partnership with what is described as the `Anglo American
establishment'. This is necessary in order to show how our partners have a history of
causing Australia significant harm and damage when we pursue their  interes ts to the

exclusion of our own.

At the expense of lengthening this foreword, it is important to understand that Australia
has been forced to act in its own interests and against those of our larger partners in the
past. But it could only occur in an environment where open public debate had aired all
the arguments fore and against and so the decision was able to be confidently made
with a large degree of public support. This legislation risks eliminating that
environment permanently, it effectively allows US and UK interests to overwhelm any
debate about Australia's own interests.

### In our history, one of the most significant and bravest of actions taken in our own interests and against UK interests and forcefully made in the face of UK opposition and attempts to subvert it - was Prime Minister John Curtin's 1942 recall of Australian 7[th] and 9[th] divisions from action in support of UK and commonwealth forces in the middle east. Curtin made multiple demands for the troops recall against strong pressure from UK PM Churchill for them to remain. Curtin received a grudging acceptance only after Japanese forces took the poorly defended UK possessions of the Malay Peninsular and Singapore where 16,000 Australians were made prisoner. Even as the troop convoys sailed towards Australia, PM Churchill diverted them to protect British colonial Burma. In the midst of this dispute Curtin began direct contact with US President Roosevelt and from then on re-aligned Australian defence policy to partner with the US rather than the UK.

 The important fact to note is, Australian Prime Minister Curtin had the political will and support to make such a momentous re-alignment because the issue had been debated openly in public and through the available information space of the time, newspapers and speeches for several years prior. Australian opinion was split between royalist/loyalists who insisted on patriotism to the King and that UK interests were Australian interests and an increasing number who believed that Australia's interests should be pursued independently, particularly as the

### UK appeared unable and unwilling to project any credible deterrent to the rise of Japanese militarism.


### 1.5 Legislation will ensure our leaders are unable to pursue Australian interests


It requires brave leadership and a love of Australian people to act against our much
larger and more powerful partners in order to protect or pursue Australian interests. To
do so will result in retaliation and this submission details how a NSW premier was
destroyed for acting in the peoples interests against those of the Bank of England.

This legislation will by omitting/wilfully ignoring - the powerful influence over our public
of the US and UK militarised information war – cause our present and future leaders to
be unable to find public support for actions in Australia's interests, because any debate
that threatens our partners interests, including debate about Australian interests and
where they diverge, will be suppressed and overwhelmed in the information space
available to the Australian public.


### 1.6 US/UK pushing for military conflict with China is NOT in Australia's interest


Discussions around the concept of information can lead us into abstractions and
theoretical scenarios. However this submission is more concerned with current events
and hard fact. Our US and UK partners are both driving a policy of containment against
China and increasingly in our available information space we see a tendency to assume
armed conflict with China is inevitable and even overt promotion of war with China such
as the think tank backed Red Alert series published over a whole week by the Sydney
Morning herald..

Given the current information war posture described above, this should be seen as a
propaganda operation that aims to indoctrinate the public to accept and support armed
conflict against China. When this indoctrination operation contaminates the information
space of the Australian public, which it is already, we are in dangerous territory.

This submission details facts which should be front of mind to all Australians. On
economic numbers alone, any armed conflict with China, even one we are not involved
in, will be catastrophic to Australia's economy. With China our number one by a long
margin export destination, armed conflict with China will disrupt four of our top five
export destinations due to their proximity to the conflict zone (Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan).

But we are likely participant in armed conflict with China under current arrangements
with our US and UK partners. This will mean the permanent loss of our top exporter and
40% of our export trade that they represent. What on earth does Australia gain from
participating, to even make up the loss we will suffer? Australia lost valuable wheat
exports as a result of the Iraq invasion. Our partners who demand our involvement in
these wars simply don't care about the cost they inflict on us.

As a participant Australia also risks unprecedented damage from China's long range
missile forces. Our major cities all contain legitimate military targets. A handful of missiles

could eliminate major iron ore ports and airfields in Northern Australia and ensure our
post conflict economic recovery is delayed by years.

We are yet to see wide scale reporting or debate of these facts amid the flood of anti
Chinese and war promoting content in Australia's information space.

More importantly, given the catastrophic risk to our future prosperity, Australia should
be leading a regional peace initiative to de-escalate the dangerous rhetoric and
posturing. Instead we have a bi-partisan agreement to bet Australia's future on a
partnership that is quite happy to expend the blood of an estimated 270,000 dead
Ukrainian proxies to fight Russia on its behalf.


### 1.7 Large disinformation operation unable to hide truth about Ukraine conflict


Keen observers of world affairs noted the unprecedented and co-ordinated banning of
RT and Sputnik Russian media outlets soon after the start of the Ukraine conflict in
2022.
Hardly the government propaganda mills they were portrayed as, nevertheless they do
report events from a Russian perspective. The co-ordinated elimination of them from
the information space available to the public is indicative of a new information
authoritarianism in the Anglo American establishment.

With now a monopoly of viewpoint, we have seen the largest scale and most overt
disinformation campaign in our living history, again serving the interests of the Anglo
American establishment. For 18 months the public was told of the imminent collapse of
Russia, death of Putin from cancer, and the defeats of an incompetent Russian military
all of it lies, but serving the purpose of pulling public support for the large scale gifting
of expensive NATO/US weaponry to Ukraine. With every weapon sent creating a new
order for replacements from the mostly US/UK armaments manufacturers.

Thus far a highly profitable strategy for the Anglo American establishment, at the
expense of vast quantities of Ukrainian blood and public monies for the countries
sending weapons (Australia $610 million of taxpayer funded weapons).


### 1.8 US/UK Ukrainian miscalculation has destroyed its military credibility


This submission details how substantial miscalculations have had unexpected and
severe consequences for the Anglo American establishment. Both of these
miscalculations were widely predicted by keen observers of current affairs – first, the
long awaited spectacle of US/UK/NATO high cost weapon systems burning, obliterated
or lying forlorn and burnt out across the Ukrainian steppe. There are now thousands of
high resolution videos online showing how, these once feared US/UK/NATO hi tech
weapons systems burn just as well as soviet era hardware. That Russia has easily
disposed of these western `wonder weapons' has proven an eye opener to many.

The second miscalculation being the lack of capacity to sustain the high intensity peer


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 8 of 93**

to peer modern war being fought. The US/UK and NATO simply do not have the large
industrial capacity to be able to expand weapons and munition production to anywhere
near the amount being consumed daily. Munitions stocks built up over decades are
being shipped in and used up in a few weeks.

Together this has caused a general realisation that the US/UK and NATO have no real
capacity for fighting high intensity modern warfare. Despite all their posturing, threats
and coercion against smaller nations, Russia has shown the world that the Anglo
American establishment are no longer the dominant global power that cannot be
resisted. Keen observers may have noticed the group of small west African nations
running to the exits before the rush begins.


### 1.9 Australia's partners are in decline and will take us down with them.


The unfortunate truth is, the US and UK (who have dominated the globe since the Soviet
Union collapsed in 1991) have hit the wall. A number of factors have conspired and what
would have been a slow decline economically, diplomatically, financially and militarily
has instead suffered a catastrophic loss of credibility.

This will act to accelerate the global dumping of the US dollar as the currency of
international trade which will signal the collapse proper. It may not be immediately
obvious but many experts have studied empire collapse and there is a consensus that
the collapse begins without anyone noticing. But once started it appears to be
exponentially accelerating

This submission provides further details about how in all likelihood a significant reason
for the information war posture and the shift to viewing their own public as adversaries is
in response to the Anglo American establishment decline and loss of international power
projection.

Having no ability to coerce compliance by threatening military force to other nations and
finding their global influence shrinking fast, they intend to use these powers against the
citizens of their own nations. Both to suppress any dissent and to eliminate critics and
truth tellers. Given the propagandising of their public via information war, at some stage
the lies about their prosperity and power will presumably no longer be believable. They
intend to keep their public misinformed for as long as possible.


### 1.10 Australia needs change – this legislation ensures the status quo


With the Anglo American establishment key partners US, UK, Australia, Canada and New
Zealand representing only 12.5% of the world population, we have been seeing a
growing number of nations moving towards the alternative BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India
China and South Africa). It is conceivable that most of the remaining 87.5% will join the
grouping.

All the longer range economic forecasters have factored in our decline. Australia drops
many places in GDP ranking to be below South Africa and above Argentina by 2040.


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 9 of 93**

However this submission holds the view that the Anglo American establishment
collapse will come much faster than forecasters are predicting.

Chained as we are to our US and UK partners, their fast collapsing global dominance
assures our near future decline also.

### The only way out of the mess we've been led into is to ensure Australia has the ability to have loud, uncomfortable, annoying, angry and critical public debate. The issues must be thoroughly aired until support starts to coalesce around articulated positions and proposed future directions.

 This open public debate, that talks about Australia's own selfish interests is already at risk of complete suppression. It is not in the interests of the UK and US that we even discuss a future viewed independent from their influence.

This legislation needs to be thrown in dustbin with severe prejudice. It has been foisted
on us to further the interests of the US and UK and to eliminate the thought of, let alone
the debate about Australia's interests.

WE need brave leaders in the mould of John Curtin, emboldened and supported by
robust public debate, to extract Australia from this oppressive and dangerous
partnership. With the US declining and withdrawing from its global projection of power,
our current position is untenable. Australia needs to chart its own course, re-brand
ourselves away from the US deputy sheriff role.

### It is also clearly in all Australians best interests that our leaders stop indulging in war rhetoric and instead advocate and promote peace. A re- branded Australia can be a leader in the peaceful settlement of conflict – a role we can all be proud of and one future generations can aspire to be involved in.

Peace is not an area the Anglo American establishment sees profit in, the opposite has
been true – war is a huge profit maker. Since they control the available information
space for all Australians, war is all we will hear. We need legislation that removes their
influence not cements it for perpetuity as this legislation will.

### On the subject of peace, the one subject you will never see or hear much about when under the influence of the Anglo American information space... would it not be fitting for Australia – one of the few continents on the planet to not have suffered war, one of the few nations to have gained independence not with weapons but with steady tenacious advocacy, debate, compromise and tolerance, a nation that has made mistakes - beginning with the mistreatment of those here before us, signing on for other peoples wars and witnessing the loss and damage,

# 2. TERMINOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS


### 2.1 Use of term “issue”


Throughout this Submission wherever the term “issue” or “this issue” is used it refers to –

“the issue of so called misinformation and/or disinformation in the various forms defined by
ACMA and certain allegations made by unspecified sources that this sub category of information
is a threat to individuals because it may cause unspecified harms, as well as a threat to the
integrity and credibility of Australia's democracy, elections and other institutions”


### 2.2 Author's usage of term does not indicate agreement with term


Throughout this submission, the use of the term issue or this issue does not imply the author agrees in any
way with the issue as defined by ACMA or as explained in the above paragraph. In fact the author does
not agree that the issue, as it has been described, is a threat as alleged. Nor does it cause unspecified
harm to individuals.

The author believes a number of surveys across several years proves that Australians are concerned by
many issues but the issue of misinformation and disinformation is NOT one of them.

As a result the issue does not require the legislation and regulatory apparatus that is being assembled.

In the event legislation and a regulatory compliance framework was enacted for the issue of misinformation
and disinformation it will need to specify and target Government misinformation, disinformation and
omissions along with state generated propaganda as these are the primary threats to the Australian public.


### 2.3 Where the submission states material is absent it means it could not be found.


In this submission, the author has listed a number of specific criticisms of ACMA's approach to their
submissions in relation to this issue. In instances where the author claims an absence of material it should
be assumed that the item was unable to be found despite a specific search for it. If ACMA contradicts
existence or availability of an item it should be assumed that public access to the item is difficult to find or
unclear.


### 2.4 Explanation of terms commonly used in submission


**2.4.i) Anglo American establishment**

This phrase has been chosen to describe a very small group of elite families and individuals who mostly
have extreme wealth but also powerful influence networks or valuable monopoly control of sought after
resources. They act as cartel wielding their combined influence and power to control and expand in
areas of shared interest and they do so at a level above the governments of sovereign nations.

These people are never spoken of nor is their cartel like operation ever referred to in media reporting,
hence the difficulty in giving their very real power and influence a name. However there have been a
number of credible and respected academics and authors who have written of their existence and
activity over a number of decades. These include; Carroll Quigley, Anthony C. Sutton, C. Wright Mills
and G. Edward Griffin.


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 11 of 93**

At some point, likely around 1913, UK elites consisting of the City of London bankers and remnant
families with wealth amassed across three centuries of British empire ascendancy had realised control of
the UK government and had initiated a scheme for training a huge cadre of future leaders, bureaucrats
and functionaries to maintain that control (Rhodes Scholars,the Round Table, Chatham House etc).

At around the same time, through family and business connections there began increasing outreach
and networking with the beneficiaries of US industrialisation, the monopolist families who amassed
extreme wealth through oil, mining, manufacturing and infrastructure. With many mutual interests and a
mutual understanding that they represented a common racial and language heritage which they
believed was naturally dominant, these groups transcended their national borders becoming the
nascent globalist elite.

The term and definition should not be taken to represent a monolithic group, there are many factions
that make up the whole, each with their own set of interests. The Anglo American establishment as far
as the term is used refers to their agreed and common interests and the power and influence they can
wield collectively in pursuit of those interests or in facing barriers or competitors.

This submission presents a plausible case that the Anglo American establishment has gained sufficient
control over the two party democratic apparatus in the US, UK and Australia to ensure elections are of
no real consequence because they have ensured candidates who pose no threat are running both sides.
This has been pursued with overt ruthlessness since 2016 when a loss of control resulted in Brexit and a
Trump presidency. As a data point, one only need research the murky circumstances surrounding the
removal of Jeremy Corbyn as UK opposition leader and known peace advocate. With Labour assured of
winning the next election, the preferred choice of Sir Keir Starmer was installed and will result in no
substantive change to UK policies.

A key indicator of Anglo American establishment control over a two party democracy is where key
policies remain unchanged after a change of government. For example in Australia defence and foreign
policy have largely remained unchanged despite the change of government from Morrison liberal to
Albanese labor.

**2.4.ii) Government**

In the context of this submission government refers to the elected government, the permanent
bureaucracy and departments, the national security apparatus including all defence services and the
domestic and internationally focused intelligence departments .

**2.4.iii) Hegemon**

Hegemon is defined as ; the actor, group, class, or state that exercises hegemonic power or that is
responsible for the dissemination of hegemonic ideas. Hegemony derives from the Greek term
hgemonia (“dominance over”), which was used to describe relations between city-states.ē

**2.4.iv) Information operation IO**

The integrated employment, during military operations, of information-related capabilities in concert
with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries
and potential adversaries while protecting our own. Also called IO.

Currently, IO activities are grouped by the Department of Defence (DOD) into five core capabilities: (1)
Psychological Operations, (2) Military Deception, (3) Operational Security, (4) Computer Network
Operations, and (5) Electronic Warfare.

**2.4.v) Information warfare IW**

Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's
awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one
conducting information warfare.

# 3. GASLIGHTING: ONGOING ABUSE OF AUSTRALIA


### 3.1 Australians suffer the abuse of Britain and now the US


When reviewing the extent of our history it's hard to conclude other than Australians
have existed in abusive relationships with our `so called' partners from before we were
even a nation. This submission outlines some examples of the abuse we have suffered at
the hands of the US and our purported `mother country' the UK.

In fact the abusive relationship has become normalised, being the small nation we are,
with an unelected foreigner as our head of state by birthright. Smaller nations are not
always exploited in an abusive manner, it is just the stock in trade and long held norm of
the Anglo American establishment to conduct their affairs in their own interests
exclusively. Other nations, partners, dominions it does not matter, the smaller nation will
be exploited against their interests if at all possible in order to weaken them and increase
their dependence.

The founding fathers of the American revolution spoke to the exploitation of man by
kings and structured their new nation to be founded on their citizens god given right to
exist unmolested by tyrants. Of course American's freedom was won by force of arms.
Australian's gained our nation in a process of gradual concessions by London who
ensured no such God given rights to exist unmolested by tyrant's were offered to
Australians.


# 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE OF `GAS-LIGHTING'


Like any abusive relationship we are subjected to a constant barrage of lies, omissions,
half truths and of course the psychopath's favourite form of abuse - `gas-lighting'

### Gas-lighting: a form of psychological abuse in which a person or group causes someone to question their own sanity, memories, or perception of reality. Victims may feel confused, anxious, or that they cannot trust themselves.


### 4.1 This legislation is gas-lighting the Australian public


This legislation is the ultimate `gas-lighting' of the Australian public. It forces us to agree
there is no such thing as government misinformation or disinformation, none produced
by intelligence agencies nor for national security, counterintelligence, influence
operations and definitely not by mainstream legacy media. We are being gas-lit by the
fact this legislation ignores and actually exempts government and legacy media from
compliance. It forces us to question the self evident facts that government and media are
the biggest source of disinfo and misinfo...


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 17 of 93**

### The question is - If they don't deal in misinformation and disinformation, why they are specifically exempt from compliance?

Once you remove government and media, there is insignificant misinfo and disinfo left
to legislate against. This is a pretty good indication that the legislation is not what it
pretends to be. In truth it targets the Australian public while ignoring and allowing free
rein to the various militarised info ops indoctrinating the Australian public to comply
with the interests of the UK and US.

Yet those advancing this legislation, those `gas-lighting' the Australian public for fun and
profit will state with a straight face that certain individuals, a small subset of the
Australian public threaten us with great harm due to their sharing of disinfo in the form
of memes generated by Russia. It is sad that the elements pushing this legislation
believe this kind of nonsense and tragic that they think the Australian public will believe
it also.


## 5. THE ANGLO AMERICAN ESTABLISHMENT


This `issue' of misinformation and disinformation has not arisen from the Australian
public as something of concern, it has never rated for them. Given the fact that the
same issue is being pushed in multiple nations and displays similarities that indicate a
certain level of co-ordination it's worth questioning what or who would be behind such
a legislative push that is clearly extant of public interest.

This submission assumes the well evidenced existence 1 of a power and influence cartel

that operates above elected government and shares characteristics across the English
speaking nations – termed the Anglo American establishment 2 .

A clear understanding of the nature, history and future decline of the Anglo American
establishment is vital and central in the understanding of the significance of the
proposed legislation.

**5.1** **The true history hidden by state misinfo/disinfo and propaganda.**

### each murdered a great many people. the British, aside from the genocide inflicted on the Irish and Scottish, mostly in foreign lands far removed, occupied by coloured folk, the Americans likewise, along with the  genocide of their own native American Indians.

 Now they've visited war upon a generally white Christian State - Russia, by expending the population of another white Christian State - The Ukraine, one could say that whatever the London and Washington Elites are guilty of, racial discrimination is not one of them. In that sense, everyone is expendable and everyone can be used - as their footstool or better yet as a proxy for waging war.

Central to understanding Australia and our place in the world, is understanding the
Anglo American establishment. There are many books and research papers available that
identify and acknowledge the existence of such hidden cartel interests, sometimes
referred to under different names such as the rules based international order RBIO. No
matter how they are described, these are not government or institutional, they are super
rich/resourced/influential groups, families and individuals that collectively pursue
common interests and collectively wield influence and political power and by way of that
wield military force.

### Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, The Anglo American establishment found themselves as the sole super-power, the global hegemon. Effectively they could not be challenged. But they wielded this power very cautiously at first. Then undertook two very thinly warranted but UN approved armed conflicts – the controlled break up of the very large and powerful Yugoslavia into it's ethnic components and the first Iraqi invasion.

 Seeing no real push back over increasingly immoral international behaviour (US sec of State Madelaine Albright in 1996 stating “...the price is worth it” when asked about half a million dead Iraqi kids as a result of economic sanctions) the Anglo American establishment became ever more ruthless and less concerned about the consequences of obtaining what they wanted, by force if necessary. .

 The truth is that the partners we are aligned and enmeshed with became increasingly immoral, unethical and blatantly criminal in their activities globally. The Anglo American establishment whilst unchallenged hegemon spent the last 35 years in exploitation of smaller nations around the world. It routinely used threat, coercion or violence to control and exploit other nations while forcing them to allow their natural resources to be exploited by their global partner corporations.

None of this is new or novel. Later in this submission, there is quote from General
Smedley Butler and a reference to his 1933 book “War is a Racket” describing his
distinguished US military service as acting as `muscle' for US corporate interests.

By understanding the dynamics of the Anglo American establishment and their
ascendancy to become globally dominant after 1991 and now 33 years later their
decline which is proceeding ever more rapidly – we can understand the source and true
purpose of the proposed legislation;


### 5.2 Withdrawal of investment capital from west to industrialise China


### Over the last two decades it became more and more evident, that our western, English speaking nations were seeing a common phenomenon. That of once great industrial and manufacturing centres falling into decline until abandoned and rusting. As the associated workforce was laid off, the media and economists would describe the time as a transition period as we moved into a more service based economy.

 At the time it seemed false if thought through logically. How can a large number of jobs that `make stuff' be turned into jobs providing a `service'? There has to be a productive part of the economy to pay for services. The narrative was that if it didn't make sense don't worry you don't understand the economy is in transition.

 In Australia's case, this didn't really matter because our productive sector was and is mining – the extraction of raw, high grade mineralised earth from the interior, railroading it in bulk to the coast, shipping it overseas in bulk where it would be refined into steel, aluminium etc We have so much at very grades that it has kept our economy from too much trouble.

 As our manufacturing and industry disappeared the mining dollars have managed to maintain a large proportion of these relatively unproductive service economy jobs. Unlike the US and UK where once thriving regions are still 40 years later left to rot. In the UK they joke that some towns in the north that were booming manufacturing centres but de-industrialised through the 1970's like Preston 'the last person employed there, took his first pay and bought the latest model black and white TV.”

 So what happened?

 And so, as global hegemon, The Anglo American establishment made the decision, on purely business grounds, to cease investing in their own western nations and instead take up the offer from the Chinese to exploit

### their vast pool of almost `no cost' labour and enjoy blanket exemptions on costly environmental, labour and corporate governance laws, allowing them unprecedented returns on their investment. The result over the next decade was more and more companies chasing profits by re-locating their manufacturing plant to China. After 15 years rather than the norm, only the exceptions retained production in high labour cost countries. Pure greed on one hand and a genuine desire by China to lift a billion people out of extreme poverty. What could possibly go wrong?

That the Anglo American establishment were motivated by greed in their dealings,
would have been known to the Chinese. Important to realise that China was ruthlessly
exploited by every major European power, the UK and also the US as recently as the
early 1900's. The UK deliberately traded tea for opium in China and when large scale
opium addiction resulted and Chinese leaders tried to stop the trade, the UK used their
gunboats to force compliance with this warped interpretation of `free trade'. In seeking
to teach a lesson and punish Chinese leaders for non compliance, the UK even went so
far as to demolish, destroy and loot the centuries old antiques and artefacts collected in
the Chinese Dowager Empress's Summer Palace in Beijing. Today this is remembered
and taught in China as the `century of humiliation'.

Viewed in this frame, with greed motivating the capitalists and a desire to lift a billion
people from extreme poverty being the motivation from the Chinese Communist Party, it
would seem as if the arrangement could continue successfully until such time as the
Chinese Communist party, by some measure, determined their goal had been met.


### 5.3 Establishment Lies and misinfo/disinfo to hide their capital withdrawal as “economics”


### This vast 30 year re-alignment of capital and investment needed to remain hidden from the public in the west. One must credit the David Rockefeller generation for their absolute skill in being able to completely mislead the public for decades, while removing hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and re-routing them to China. Compliant politicians and bureaucrats were armed with carefully crafted statements backed up by fabricated economic theory advanced by fully funded academic institutions to explain the expected economic and social decline in the west. If aspects of their vast capital investments in China were exposed, they were explained more or less as `bringing democracy to China by creating greed'. Put simply the Anglo American Establishment perpetuated a 30 year fraud on the people of the west in pursuit of greed.

Explanations like `transitioning to a service economy', `structural reform', `removal of
barriers to allow free trade', `liquidity crisis' were all advanced to explain intractable
issues like interest rates that kept rising, high inflation and high unemployment. When
the real cause was that investment capital followed the lure of massive returns on
investment in the China industrialisation project. Most importantly the public in the US,
UK and Australia took the bogus explanations in good faith and believed them.

**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 21 of 93**

When viewed from this perspective, the economic instability and resultant financial
ups and downs we have all experienced over the decades is at root, the result of the
vast and systemic withdrawal of capital investment from Australia's productive assets manufacturing and industry, and it's re-deployment to China. Interest rates in the late
1980's, 1990's and early 2000's rose to very high levels due to scarcity of available
loan capital.

In effect, the Anglo American establishment has manipulated the economies of
the world and rashly and greedily gambled all of our futures in order to obtain
super profits from their Chinese investments.


### 5.4 Current generation of Elites: incompetent, greedy, impatient and doomed


### But, those making up the Anglo American establishment are a different generation to those now deceased from the David Rockefeller era, who carefully and skilfully went about their activities while managing information, governments and bureaucracy to ensure it was completed in total secrecy from the public.

 The inheritors, the successors now leading the Anglo American elite are a generation who have only known the power of global full spectrum dominance, not the carefully played long game that was required to amass that power. They appear greedy, impatient, incompetent and fundamentally unable to change their methods of operation. Their predictable reaction is to double down when faced with opposition and to ultimately rely on their military dominance to obtain the expected compliance. Because they can and will concoct any excuse to bomb, invade or even sponsor terror groups inside non compliant nations.

In fact even now it appears that they have over relied on military power, believed their
propaganda about unmatched capability and tech and network dominance in warfighting. In engineering terms: this system of operation could be termed as - critical
reliance on a component with no redundancy.


### 5.5 Falling out with China: over a more equitable profit share


Reasoned speculation leads to the conclusion that by some measure The Chinese
Communist Party believes it has met its goal for elevating a billion people from extreme
poverty. From that point it seems obvious that they would require a more equitable
sharing of the vast profits and return on investment. Or want to pay out what is to them
foreign investment.

Based on prior behaviour, the Anglo American establishment have no experience in
sharingorequitablearrangementsWhenanationwouldnotcomplyorbackdown


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 22 of 93**

they are ever reliant on their global military dominance to ensure continued compliance.
In April 2022 it was announced that 800 million had been elevated from poverty, it may
be that over 1 billion have been elevated from the lower measure termed `extreme
poverty'. If so, achieving it will have coincided very closely with the calls for a war with
China coming from politicians and media.

The underlying reasons for conflict have also been somewhat obvious once the Chinese
Industrialisation project was identified as being at the expense of western development.

### In recent years, it has become very apparent that the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Anglo American establishment has soured. China is suddenly listed as the number one adversary and existential threat. The Anglo American Establishment quickly transitioned from relative silence about China, to using all their compliant channels to argue the case for containment if not war with China.


### 5.6 Calls for a war they have no capacity to fight with China


There is plenty of evidence throughout history showing very powerful, militarily
unmatched empires suddenly and unexpectedly collapsing. Almost like a critical
component of empire failed and there was no redundancy.

### The Anglo American Establishment who inherited the full spectrum global dominance, where not the same generation that carefully amassed that power. Whether by cruel twist of fate or, God designed human inbuilt safety feature – ultimate power, when inherited by those who did not amass it, is wielded with increasing hubris and decreasing competence. The seed of downfall growing inside every empire.

Herein we find the fundamental problem now faced by the Anglo American
establishment. Having over relied on their own military supremacy in order to force
compliance from every other nation on earth, while possessing a high degree of hubris
about their infallibility and superiority to all before them – has caused a pile up of
failures, eyes taken off the ball, flawed assumptions, over confidence in their ability to fix
emerging problems later and collecting more and more advisers who confirm their
bosses biases, indulge their worst excesses, impatience and intemperance.

The result has been a cascade of publicly visible failures and then in response, more and
more overt reactions which eventually lead to overreach. The resulting public spectacle
of things not going in the Anglo American's favour is a novel experience. This would
never have happened in David Rockefeller's era.

The first catastrophic failure facing the Anglo American establishment is the complete
collapse of competence in their military planning and logistics. This is precisely what is
happening in the Ukraine.

### It's one thing to carry a big stick, use threatening rhetoric and adopt

### aggressive postures. But, if you do not have the capability to conduct the war you threaten to bring on others, clearly your days at the top are numbered.

The Russia Ukraine conflict has offered a bloody preview of what a proper peer matched
high intensity modern conflict looks like. This also is novel. Since 1991 when the
hegemon began its two UN backed armed conflicts in Iraq and former Yugoslavia we
saw a US/UK over-match against an outdated low tech adversary with no aviation to
speak of. In Iraq war 2.0 as detailed later in this submission, prior to the invasion, the
CIA paid Iraqi generals millions of dollars not to fight. The US hardly fired a shot in that
one.

A future non nuclear peer matched conflict involves extreme high intensity use of
artillery, guided munitions, drones, drone munitions and rocketry. Simply put, the US/UK
and NATO have absolutely no clue and no experience in this realm. They have all
woefully miscalculated required stocks of each munition in order to maintain a high level
of intensity for the required duration of conflict. The vast amounts of existing
ammunition and munitions stock shipped to Ukraine have taken two decades (since Iraq
2.0) to build. They will run out of ammunition and drones by early 2024. Reason being –
lack of industrial, chemical and manufacturing capacity.

Ukraine: Destroyed NATO vehicles and video from a kamikaze drone before impact

### The US, UK, NATO and allies have no actual realistic capacity to wage modern war because they lack the capacity to provide the required volume of munitions to sustain one. In order to change this situation it will costs many hundreds of billions of dollars and up to a decade to do so.

Believing their global dominance to be permanent has been a fatal assumption for the
Anglo American establishment. It seems they have held the belief that they could safely
re-locate the vast majority of global manufacturing and industrial capacity to China – in
order to receive that unmatched return on investment.

BEFORE AND AFTER: $4 million US Bradley fighting vehicle in Ukraine

But in doing this they have stripped the west not only of the obvious industrial and
manufacturing hardware, they have stripped the west's people of any incentive to train
in engineering, science or hi tech. Why do it if there are no jobs? Yes they can import
trained people from India as they have done to a large degree to staff silicon valley. But
sitting a tech person in front of a workstation is easy compared to staffing a new
industrial, chemical or manufacturing facility. Productive output will take years to become
significant or profitable.

### The Anglo American establishment has in recent decades over relied on their military dominance to enforce their will, enable looting of resources or as a threat to gain compliance...The Ukraine Russia conflict has exposed to the entire world in hi resolution detail that their high tech weaponry burns just as well as lesser, cheaper versions and that they and their NATO partners have no industrial, chemical or manufacturing capacity to produce the large volume of munitions required to sustain a high intensity modern war. Russia kept their manufacturing & industrial base at a high capacity and with the capability to quickly expand if needed..

 5.7 No capacity to change, will turn on public dissent before economic collapse


Unfortunately our future as Australian's being partnered with a declining former globally
dominant bully is not a bright one. Our English speaking block dominated by the Anglo
American establishment - US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand represents only 12.5%
of the worlds population.

Former US ambassador and respected member of the realist school of international
affairs Chas Freeman recently articulated his lack of optimism about capacity for change
from the US side 3 but this applies equally to the Anglo American establishment;

### The operative question is whether the United States, with our current

### ‘you’re with us or against us’ mentality and obsession with “great power rivalry,” could muster the flexibility to help put in place a framework that would serve more than our own selfish interests. It is hard to be optimistic about this.

And he acknowledges the problems faced as a result of past behaviours again, his US
focus is equally applicable to the Anglo American establishment;

### Washington must adjust to the new reality that its...client states... will no longer...defer to interests of the United States they cannot be persuaded to see as their own. Such persuasion would require a level of respectful American diplomatic engagement with them, not seen in decades...America will not succeed by focusing on preventing them from accepting such benefits from China or other great power competitors while offering no attractive alternatives.

Our partners have behaved so poorly that unlike times past, it appears that the 87.5%
of the world population will likely gravitate away and towards the BRICS nations and in
doing so take the opportunity to shun us. The result for Australia will be rapid economic
decline.

### With no capacity nor desire to engage with other nations in a mutually beneficial manner and with the fast decreasing credibility of its military power it uses for compliance, the Anglo American establishment faces a far from bright future. Almost certain to be shunned by the 87.5% of global population gravitating towards the BRICS nations, it seems most likely they will turn inwards. The misinfo/disinfo laws that have popped up in the UK, Canada and Australia look to be the first sign of a coming crackdown on free speech and dissenting views in media. The Anglo American establishment's dominance in world affairs is slowly falling apart and they need to keep that news from their public.


### 5.8 This legislation is a tool to control public debate/dissent


The Australian public, along with the public in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand
have been systematically lied to and abused for decades. The Anglo American
establishment has found themselves exposed to the world as being incapable of
waging a modern high intensity conflict, because they have no capacity to produce the
high volumes of munitions required to sustain one.

### The effect being the same whichever way you look at it – their long history of using or threatening to use their military dominance to force compliance – is over, because they can no longer do so credibly.

There are many ways that this this new reality could be managed towards a positive
outcome for everyone in the world. However the sad fact is, the Anglo American


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 26 of 93**

establishment has no history, no ability and no desire to reach mutually agreeable
solutions.

Therefore the most likely outcome is international isolation and economic decline.
However based on their very nature it is highly likely that unable to threaten other
nations they will turn on their public and use violent measures to suppress dissent.

There will be a lot of dissent created as economies go into decline and the reason
for this becomes widely known. Hence this legislation should be seen as part of a
weaponisation of information and language aimed at the public and in the interests
of the establishment elites.


### 5.9 Australia and the Anglo American Establishment


Australia has since the early 1940's aligned its interests with those of the US while
retaining close cultural and historic links to the UK as well as maintaining the Crown as
head of state. This grouping of US and UK interests is often called the Anglo American
establishment.

There is no question that Australia through it's close ties and enmeshment with the
Anglo American establishment is fully committed to its membership of the so called
RBIO. The Australian public has for many decades been subjected to misinformation and
disinformation from our government and legacy media that misleads us as to the real
nature and decline into criminal actions of the Anglo American establishment.

Despite the fairy tale we have been indoctrinated with – we are not the good guys. We
are partners with a criminal cartel as bad as the worst in history, already responsible for
the violent deaths of millions of people. – our so called partners are immoral and beyond
redemption, the rest of the world was in fear but now they are learning that the power is
in decline. There will be cascade of coups, as there has been in Africa, as smaller nations
depose the Anglo American puppets who they had managed to gain control.

Australia faces real danger. We are being subjected to an unprecedented volume of
propaganda and disinformation from the Anglo American establishment. If our
government thinks there is bare public support they may succumb to pressure to
participate in military escalation or actual force projection against China. The result
will be disastrous for the Australian economy, we may not be able to recover to the
current level for decades. - Meanwhile we are gas-lit with legislation that will help
them shut down dissent or opposition.


# 6. AUSTRALIANS DO NOT TRUST GOVERNMENT NOR MEDIA


### 6.1 Open source public surveys prove decreasing trust.


There are multiple polls that show the consistent decrease in the Australian public's trust
and faith that our Government and our media are acting in our best interests.


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 27 of 93**

Trust in Government and media honesty is consistently in decline, Australians are
increasingly of the opinion Government and media create a more divisive society. More
specifically, over 60% of Australians are now overwhelmingly of the opinion that we are
being lied to by media, Government and societal leaders4.

### 6.2 No attempt to re-build public trust – just laws to suppress growing public distrust


The surveys showing the public's decreasing trust have been trending this way for
many years, they come as no surprise. Yet, by taking no action to mitigate these
negatives, Australia's political class and media have shown the Australian public that
they simply don't care to redress the issue.

In an environment where over 60% of Australians believe strongly that their
Government is purposefully lying and/or trying to mislead them with false or gross
exaggerations and where the numbers are increasing by 3% per year, it's easy to see
the proposed legislation as an attempt to suppress and censor the growing resentment,
anger and dis-satisfaction with Australia's political class,


### 6.3 This legislation proves government bad faith – Australians beware!

The fact that this legislation has been proposed at this time rather than a concerted,
good faith attempt by Government and media to rebuild trust with the Australian
public represents the biggest failure of responsible governance in recent history.

Having no desire and no ideas for rebuilding trust with the Australian public,
our politician and media have instead allowed sinister elements to present this
legislation in the hope of controlling the information space available to a population
that no longer trusts them and no longer believes them.

All in all the Australian public should be congratulated for their razor sharp
perception of a lying, misleading and grossly exaggerating Government and
media.

However this legislation is proof that the government response is not in attempts
to rebuild the broken trust, it is responding by weaponizing legislation against
what it perceives is a hostile public, an effective declaration of war and an
intention to use state propaganda to pacify and indoctrinate the public that
distrusts them.

# 7. PROBLEMS, QUESTIONS & ISSUES RAISED BY THIS LEGISLATION


### 7.1 No public mandate, no transparency about who is behind it


The issue of misinformation and disinformation appears to have emerged from unknown
sources (likely Defence/intel) and advanced through Australia's federal government,
evolving eventually into the draft legislation that is open for public submission and
comment.

The legislation has no public mandate because multiple surveys show
misinformation and disinformation have never rated as issues of concern to the
Australian public. As a result there needs to be clear and accessible information to
allow public understanding about the source, origin and evolution of this issue as it
became legislation. At present there is no access or no ability to find information
that would allow that understanding


### 7.2 Criticisms: ACMA presentation of info, info access, methodology,


This submission makes a number of criticisms about the lack of transparency, poor
presentation and apparent lack of public access to information. It certainly appears that
the information provided by the Department and ACMA has been a box ticking exercise
that meets bare compliance with little thought or care about facilitating better public
understanding of the issue and the context it has arisen from.

This submission also criticises the methodology (or lack thereof) that has
underpinned ACMA's papers and submissions regarding the issue. From the
information publicly accessible, ACMA's work lacks rigour and precision and as a
result the issue suffers from overly broad descriptions, poorly defined key terms
and no available paper trail to determine who contributed and how decisions were
made. Finally ACMA has no credible model to allow ongoing performance of their
compliance framework nor have they arrived at credible key measurable s that
would allow success criteria to be determined.


### 7.3 Deliberate framing of issue to misattribute cause and culprits


Significantly, this issue of misinformation and disinformation appears to have been
deliberately framed in order to allow causes and culprits to be intentionally
misattributed. Why this would be done? I can't answer. However it likely can be
answered by a full explanation about why government and legacy media was exempted
from the legislation and regulatory compliance framework.

Removing government and legacy media results in the two largest, most prolific and
endemic generators of misinformation and disinformation to be out of scope
(government you say? Yes, think intelligence agencies and national security. CIA
and MI6 finance and run enormous multi channel multi subject disinfo operations).


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 29 of 93**


### 7.4 Gas-lighting the public about source of misinfo/disinfo


Of course, those advancing this legislation appear to be comfortable gas-lighting the
Australian public by pretending the tiny volume of misinfo/disinfo remaining is
significant and troubling, poses a threat, risks harm and requires the full glare of
legislation and ACMA's regulatory compliance framework. Like any good gas-lighting
the Australian public end up as not only the victim of misinfo/disinfo but blamed for
sharing it (at least a subset of the public is).

The manner that this issue will now misattribute the cause and culprit to the usual
tropes that are blamed for so many of polite societies ills, while exempting the real
ones, will lead to the inevitable result that targets a subset of the Australian public
for sharing banned info and then pretends that the resulting censorship and
additional control over the Australian public's available information is necessary to
keep us safe – sure seems like a repeat of the now thoroughly discredited, `war on
terror'. Surely not!


### 7.5 Unanswered questions about origin and source of issue


There needs to be a whole lot more transparency about this legislation and this
submission lists a number of specific questions that really need to be answered to allow
public understanding of the context surrounding the issue.


### 7.6 Condemning Australia to decline because disinfo is misleading public


Australia is partnered with exactly 12.5% of the world population. The remaining 87.5%
of the worlds population have more or less decided they no longer want to be
dominated, patronised and threatened by our partners. Could it be worse? Yes our
partners are in economic decline the G7 nations have declined over the last 20 years
from 65% of global GDP to 44%.. By 2040 the G7 nations will represent half of the GDP
of the BRICS nations.
If Australia maintains the status quo of it's alignment and current partners,by 2040 we
can expect to fall from 19[th] largest GDP to 28[th], below South Africa and above
Argentina.
Future generations of Australians will be less wealthy and have less options to earn a
living and remain solvent.


### 7.7 Cost to future Australians of state propaganda lies today


The future generations of Australians are going to look at the leadership and
bureaucracy of today and wonder why nobody was able to stop the slide and re-orient
us to prosperity. Particularly when so many other nations, like Indonesia will have
become so successful and their populations wealthy and prosperous. By contrast
without taking bold and brave steps to change, Australia will have followed the US and
UK in economic and geopolitical decline. Our children and grandchildren will likely find
that they have limited opportunities in Australia and so be forced to leave, becoming
domestic staff for the upper middle class of Asia. How tables turn.

### 7.8 Threat of Extreme dangers from state disinfo misleading public


The sad reality is, the straight faced pretending, the lack of transparency, the targeting of
the wrong culprits, the exemption of the real ones, the over simplification of the subject
and the refusal to accept and acknowledge the vast 24/7 state run misinfo/disinfo assault
currently contaminating the information space of the Australian public...will ensure the
Australian public are misled instead of warned about the looming and very real dangers
facing Australia.

The two biggest dangers are the use of propaganda to assist in bringing public opinion
around to support war with China and the misleading of the public about the decline
economically and geopolitically of our so called partners – the US and UK.

### Time is of the essence. There is still an opportunity to change direction and be transparent and honest with the Australian people, identify and acknowledge the massive amounts of state propaganda that influences the information space of Australians. Frame the problem honestly. Find a way that stops disinfo by omission which is the most common way Australians are misled.


### 7.9 Threat of extreme danger of state propaganda leading us to war with China


There is an obvious and relentless contamination of the Australian public's available
information space with state created propaganda. One of the endemic themes of this
propaganda is the criticism, in fact demonisation of China and its Government. Much of
this propaganda takes the form of framing war as inevitable.

Former Ambassador Chas Freeman, US State Department veteran and a foreign and
international affairs expert from the realist school of diplomacy is very concerned;

### In 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to contend with us for global hegemony and collapsed, leaving us without an obvious enemy. China has now become our cure for enemy-deprivation syndrome. In its case, we have abandoned diplomacy as an instrument of national defence and foreign relations. The casus belli between us is Taiwan’s separation from the rest of China,...We no longer even
 pretend to comply with the basic agreements that we later worked out with Beijing to enable it to set the Taiwan issue aside for future peaceful resolution. Now, all the talk is about how to fight a war to determine Taiwan’s status.

And right now, the Anglo American Establishment are engaged in a high volume,
relentless information operation to poison the minds of Australian's to view Chinese as
enemies who are hell bent on expansion, so China requires military encirclement and
constraint.

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 31 of 93**

The most idiotic aspect of this entire operation is that you will notice a state generated
propaganda piece which tries to breed distrust, fear and hatred towards China. Often in
close proximity will be articles about Australian trade, mining or economic numbers.

It is truly stunning to see such bi polar or schizophrenic coverage in the media. Because
even a quick scan will reveal the enormous degree to which the Australian economy is
dependant on China. The numbers are staggering

China accounts for about 40% of Australia's total exports, the vast majority being Iron
Ore, then Gas and Gold. Australia has a trade surplus with China of between $8bn and
$11bn per month, up a whopping 70% from last year.

Chas Freeman continues;

### Both sides must know that such a war would be catastrophic for Taiwan, disastrous for both the United States and China, and severely damaging to any country that joined either us or the Chinese in the fight. But no one in Washington is attempting to find either solutions or a temporising modus vivendi for managing Sino-American differences over Taiwan, as the Nixon administration did fifty years ago.

Chas is most distressed that US now acts in an arbitrary manner and unilaterally breaks
long standing Agreements between the US and China. As mentioned earlier in this
submission, the Anglo American establishment have increasingly made a mockery of
their so called Rules Based International Order. Every nation can see that they enact
rules, exempt themselves, enforce the rules for adversaries and non compliant nations
while ensuring no enforcement ever takes place against partners. Treaties are
unilaterally broken more and more as well. In recent years, many nations no longer have
any trust in dealings with the RBIO.

So to reiterate;

### our partners, the Anglo American Establishment are in some kind of conflict with China. Most likely China is refusing to comply with their demands. Threats are being publicly made and a vast info and propaganda operation is underway beating the drums of war. As Junior partner Australia is expected to be part of any action against China.

 However, conflict with China is NOT in Australia's best interests. China is Australia's number one trade partner, in fact four out of the top five trade partners would be in the combat zone in any conflict with China...this would wipe out Australia's trade surplus of $150bn - $180 bn per year and send the balance of trade into deficit. Analysts predict the Australian dollar would drop a minimum of 20% in relation to the USD. Australia's economy would be in free fall from the moment the first shot was fired.

It's natural for people to fall into a satisfying belief that war could not really happen. But
the situation is far more serious. The Anglo American establishment have already


-----

**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 32 of 93**

commenced the first stage of conflict.

The first stage is the large scale, multi channel information operation that is currently
underway,in which the Australian public is subjected to continual and relentless
contamination of their available information space. The aim being to influence and
propagandise the Australian people with misinfo/disinfo so that they see China as the
enemy, in other words prepare the public for war. The disinfo/misinfo is state generated
likely by the UK MOD and distributed via English speaking news channels etc.

Based on Australia's current posture, which is complete subservience to partners, then
from the first shot fired Australia's economy will go into free fall. Exports would drop 55%
and that's around $10bn in income per month gone. But it gets worse.
Our number 2,3 and 5 trading partners are Japan (trade surplus $32bn/yr), South Korea
(trade surplus $20bn/yr) and Taiwan (trade surplus $8bn/yr) . Any conflict with China will
disrupt or blockade trade with all three nations, due to their proximity.

Australia would immediately lose 4 of its top 5 trading partners,

As well our shipments to our number 4 top trading partner of India would be vulnerable
to attack by Chinese submarines patrolling the Northern Indian Ocean. More vulnerable
still will be our supply chain coming from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and
Hong Kong. Which will severely limit access to technology goods.

Finally Australia's infrastructure is unprotected, in a shooting war we can expect China to
use long range missiles to attack port facilities on our northern coast, many of which are
specifically set up to provide export of bulk commodities like iron ore. Which means our
post conflict recovery will be delayed until the ports are operational. Post conflict it will
be unlikely our number 1 trade partner continues to do business with us.

It is clear that the Anglo American establishment sees China as an existential threat to
their continued global hegemony. As a result, the elite establishment view is that China
must be reduced via armed conflict. The overt strategy, available as open source reading
from any number of sources is to inflict sufficient damage on China from all avenues –
kinetic, political, information, diplomatic and economic that it remains off balance and
unable to exert dominance in any field. One imagines the Anglo Americans would
simultaneously stir up trouble with China's various ethnic groups and even arm an
insurgency to conduct terrorism on Chinese territory.

Like all wars instigated by the Anglo American establishment including the first and
second world wars, a great deal of resources are spent in using propaganda to bring
public opinion around to viewing the target nations as enemies such that when armed
conflict does begin the war has majority public support.


### 7.10 Australian cities will be targets for missile strikes in China war


The Anglo American establishment has openly admitted it seeks war with China and is
engaged in propaganda and influence operations to gain public support.


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 33 of 93**

Should the war with China proceed, make no mistake Australian cities will be among the
first targets of China's long range missiles. Every Australian city contains military
installations and these are legitimate targets, despite the proximity of civilian homes.
For example Garden Island in Potts Point Sydney, Victoria Barracks on St Kilda Road
Melbourne and its extensive bunker command facilities, Pine Gap at Alice Springs etc
etc. Edinburgh Air Force base in Adelaide.

There is simply no debate about the threats, risks of harm and dangers Australia faces
should the Anglo American establishment get their war with China. For example in the
likely event that Australia is subjected to a partial naval blockade, what can we expect
to see shortages of? What will happen with air travel from Australia to overseas, a
significant proportion uses Asian routes?

These are the real threats and actual harms risked by the misinfo/disinfo operation
pushing propaganda to influence public support for war with China. This
legislation and the inadequacy of all parties involved (in its promotion and
advancement) to deal honestly and realistically with this rather than the imaginary
ones presented is a dereliction of their duty in protecting the Australian public.


# 8. TRUE SOURCES OF DISINFO/MISINFO ARE EXEMPTED.


### 8.1 Governments, intel, national security & legacy media are the biggest culprits


The most fundamental problem with the framing of this issue and legislation, is the
pretence of all involved in ignoring the true sources and proliferators of misinformation
and disinformation both in Australia and globally – Governments, in particular the
intelligence and national security state apparatus. Following close behind because they
operate so closely with those just mentioned is the mainstream legacy media.

From time to time there are exposures 5 that prove how close media and even

individual journalists are to Government, via law enforcement, intelligence and national
security.

Observant members of the public can see the proliferation of online articles or even
twitter posts from particular journalists or publications that echo Government
messaging. While there is no evidence of Government influence or financial inducement
to effectively become Government propaganda agents, it is worth noting the massive
proliferation of content which aligns Government messaging or policy since the start of
the Ukraine conflict.

Obviously the UK and US Governments have vastly more resources to spread and
amplify their content or propaganda, but it's important to remember that the information
space of the Australian public likely encounters significant amounts of Government
influenced content via US and UK sources.

Image 1. Richard Kemp: Government aligned content by coincidence or by

inducement?

### 8.2 No transparency: existing censorship agreements affecting Australians' information


### Governments in the US, UK and Australia have many existing mechanisms to censor. control and manipulate the information and media available to their public. To think they are not used on a daily basis is naive and from time to time they are exposed doing so.

The manner this issue has been framed, along with the proposed legislation and the
regulatory compliance are in themselves good examples of how the Government
misleads the Australian public with pretence and lack of transparency

This lack of transparency obscures the fact that this legislation operates as part of a wider
and secretive matrix of laws, regulation and other compliance measures designed to
ensure the ongoing if not permanent control of the information space in order to mislead
the Australian public about important issues that affect their interests.

Some recent disclosures allow us a partial view of tools and measures used by the UK
and US Governments to control the information flowing to both their own and the
Australian public..

It was revealed and now openly admitted that the UK uses the Defence Security Media
Advisory (DSMA) committee 6 to control what is and what is not publicly disclosed by

media in the UK. This committee is very active in warning publishers and suppressing any
disclosure deemed `not in the national interest', regardless of importance in terms of
public interest..DSMA is effectively state propaganda and censorship and it's
enforcement powers are severe enough to ensure voluntary compliance. DSMA acts to
chill and suppress debate about any issue that is deemed as containing national security

interests.

Recent Congressional hearings 7 exposed vast information suppression and

manipulation by the silicon valley cartel and their global social media monopolies. More
troubling, the hearings and other information releases exposed highly partisan bias
during an election as well the active involvement of law enforcement, intelligence
agencies and the national security apparatus in choosing particular content and users to
suppress.

Other recent exposures have implicated the same social media monopolies in active
promotion of partisan issues and creation of fake users to push those issues into
prominence.

Shockingly, there is ample evidence proving social media companies have collaborated
with US intelligence in overseas election interference and fomenting of regime change
operations in the form of so called colour revolutions 8.

When it comes to Australia we simply do not know what similar agreements or
structures are in place to control information flow to the Australian public.
However there is circumstantial evidence to suggest there are such tools already
operating 9.

### 8.3 The mystery of bipartisan foreign and defence policies or simply secret info controls


This is further highlighted by what seems to be inexplicable bi partisanship on foreign
policy from both political parties. Australia's foreign policy remains the same regardless
of elections and momentous changes of Government. Even our current foreign minister
is silent and compliant about inheriting an aggressive policy of confronting China,
AUKUS and nuclear submarines. All of which she is on the record as opposing.

What is it that overrides our democratic processes and is powerful and persuasive
enough to make political opponents take on prior foreign and defence policy that they
criticised while in opposition? It sure feels to the Australian public like secret forces have
more influence than their vote. It certainly seems as if foreign influence is at work, given
that Australia's foreign and defence policy always aligns with and works in the best
interests of the Anglo American establishment.

To be transparent is to reveal secrets, in revealing secrets governments expose
that they make mistakes. A culture of state secrecy therefore trends towards
becoming self perpetuating.

### 8.4 Recent media stories showing information control/manipulation


Recently, the destruction of the Nordstream gas pipeline was widely first reported in a
nonsensical manner that attributed blame to Russia, when the asset itself belonged to
Russia. Soon after the event, acclaimed and respected US investigative journalist
Seymour Hersh published several articles with alleged insider knowledge that the
pipeline was destroyed by US special forces in a secret operation approved by the US
President. Yet this story was not run on any mainstream legacy media or news platforms.
The story did however receive wide coverage on independent and citizen journalist sites.
Our mainstream media ignored the story leaving their only reporting as either a mystery,
a nonsensical clear falsehood that Russia blew up its own pipeline or avoids speculation

completely.

**Here, the public discovers that social media platform**
**Twitter's Head of Editorial in Europe was also an Army**

Was the widespread suppression of the Seymour Hersh stories in mainstream legacy
media a directive from the US Government? Did our Government take steps to suppress
it domestically? Regardless it is circumstantially indicative that there is active suppression
in existence that controls the information flow to the Australian public.

This legislation is being advanced and debated without a complete, open and
honest disclosure by our Government of the existing agreements and/or
mechanisms whereby the flow of information available to the Australian public is
already subject to filtering, restriction, suppression or manipulation either by our
government or by the UK or US government.


# 9. EVIDENCE PROVING VAST STATE RUN DISINFO/MISINFO OPERATION


### 9.1 Australians fed disinformation & propaganda about Ukraine Russia war


### ...Unlike previous Western conflicts such as Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ukrainian Proxy War has been attended by the largest and most pervasive state driven media propaganda campaigns observed thus far in the contemporary Western experience...


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 37 of 93**

Once more the proposed misinfo/disinfo legislation and regulatory/compliance
structure will do nothing to address the shameful and unhealthy contamination of the
information space available to the Australian public regarding the Ukraine Russia
conflict.

Australian's are subjected to a 24/7 monopoly of state based propaganda, lies,
misleading omissions and racist vilification of the Russian nation, the Russian people
and their elected leadership. Along with blatant falsifications about Russia's imminent
collapse, Ukraine's military successes and general misrepresentation of the truth about
the military situation.

In order to create this monopoly it was necessary to eliminate alternative reporting.
An example of this is the egregious censorship and perversion of free speech shown in
the blanket termination of the Russian news services RT and Sputnik in early 2022
following the start of the Ukraine/Russia conflict. Predictably the reason given was
misinformation and disinformation. This in itself provides a crystal clear view of the
abuse of process surrounding the issue and the disaster that awaits Australia should this
legislation be enacted.

### The real reason for the suppression of RT and Sputnik is the Anglo American establishment's determination to control the flow of information to its citizens, provide a monopoly of state run propaganda and suppress opposing or dissenting viewpoints. The aim being to create public support for the Ukraine side of the conflict and for the increasing escalation of the conflict by provision of US, UK and NATO weapons 10.

The Anglo American establishment, who monopolise Australian's available information
space and other members of NATO are losing in the Ukraine by multiple measures. The
Ukrainian Government is no longer democratic, has ceased elections and eliminated
any information dissenting with Government propaganda. NATO weaponry supplied to
Ukraine is being destroyed very quickly and efficiently by the Russians. Furthermore the
much awaited Ukraine counter offensive has achieved nothing of lasting value and been
at the cost of tens of thousands of Ukrainian dead and hundreds of NATO supplied
vehicles.

However, each and every one of these facts is considered as misinfo or disinfo under
the perversion of truth that the Australian public is force fed on a 24/7 basis and
expected not only to swallow but to also endorse and believe.

### Even in World War 2 there was a level of reality allowed in the Australian information space that helped in giving PM Curtin the ability to fundamentally alter Australia's orientation from UK aligned to the US.


10 By suppressing dissenting viewpoints the Anglo American establishment is able to present state run

propaganda and disinformation such as; Russian intent to rig mines to destroy Europe's largest nuclear
power station - debunked by IAEA; Rejection of Russian claims of bio weapon labs – debunked by Victoria
Nuland admitting their existence in congressional testimony; several instances alleging Russia's targeting of
ci ilians each instance deb nked hen pro en strike as from Ukrainian air defence missiles


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 38 of 93**

### This space to implement radical new solutions to benefit the Australian public is simply not possible under the current misinfo/disinfo operation affecting all Australians. Only status quo opinions or policies are authorised.

In this environment it is a dangerous dereliction of responsibility and duty to allow
Australian's to be thoroughly misled and propagandised by state based misinfo and
disinfo.

The barrage of 24/7 lies Australian's are subjected to, leaves no room for anything
but status quo policy and maintaining our role as the least powerful partner in the
abusive Anglo – American establishment.


### 9.2 “Narrative error” exposes control matrix over Australian public's available info.


As is the usual case where Government, intelligence agencies and national security use
secrecy to hide their activities from their own citizens, we only learn of the extent of
control and influence in isolated cases which escape (temporarily) the multi layered, multi
vectored secret control matrix extended over the information space available to the
Australian public.

**9.2.i) CASE STUDY: SHOCK! SCANDAL, NZ JOURNALIST ADDS CONTEXT**

Consider the following very recent example of the extent of insidious control over
language and the authoritarian reaction when context and truth slips through the control
matrix and is broadcast to the public. Radio New Zealand, the Government owned
national broadcaster in June 2023 made headlines over the the following;

### A journalist was accused of `inappropriate editing' of the incoming Reuters news feed, apparently committing the cardinal sin of inserting context in order to present, in that journalists judgement, more balanced reporting. Over several months the journalist wrote 16 articles covering the Ukrainian conflict and Radio New Zealand broadcast those stories as written before discovery.

 The journalist added the word `coup' to describe the Maidan revolution, changed the description of Ukraine's former `pro Russian president' to read instead `pro Russian elected government'.

 Over several articles the journalist had added `pro western' to describe the installed post coup Ukrainian Government, and added that they had `suppressed ethnic Russians'. In several instances the journalist had added references to `Russian concerns about neo Nazi elements' in Ukraine's government'.


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 39 of 93**

### In one particular article, the journalist added a paragraph that read `The Kremlin also said its invasion was sparked by a failure to implement the Minsk agreement  peace accords, designed to give Russian speakers autonomy and protection, as  well as the rise of neo-Nazi elements in Ukraine since a coup ousted a Russia- friendly government in 2014'

It is worth reflecting for a moment, that every single insertion the journalist has made
thus far is irrefutable fact. However fact is clearly unauthorised and must be stripped out
to be compliant.

The result of this `glitch in the information control matrix' was grovelling apologies by
the head of Radio NZ to the unseen hands that had enabled his appointment as
trusted guardian of approved narratives. The responsible minister assuring the public
this unauthorised outbreak of truth was being taken seriously and steps taken to ensure
it wasn't repeated.

Radio New Zealand is not some extremist privately owned fiefdom. It is the
Government owned broadcaster of our neighbour and fellow vassal of the Anglo
American establishment. Radio New Zealand represents the same basic operation as
our ABC and SBS. Any suggestion that this example is unique to NZ and not reflective
of Australia's information space lacks credibility.

This example is instructive in many ways. It proves that information fed to the
Australian and New Zealand public is purposefully stripped of any context or
balance in order to promote those interests aligned with one side of a story.
Further, any attempt to re-insert context and balance is considered a serious
incident that itself receives headline coverage and termination of the journalist
involved.


# 10. OMISSION IS OMITTED, AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC MISLED BY OMISSION.


### 10.1 Strangely Misinfo/Disinfo by omission ignored:


The co-ordinated sprouting of this issue of misinfo/disinfo was accompanied by much
hand wringing and pearl clutching in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Strangely however, none the measures responding to the `so called' misinfo/disinfo
issue has ever approached the subject of `omission'.

Omission can cause deception or be misleading which can lead to harm such as fraud.
Certainly acts of deception and fraud by omission have been long established as threats
to society and individuals and are well established planks of the Australian legal system.
The concept of lying by omission is also well known and generally understood in society


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 40 of 93**

at large to be at minimum dishonest, sneaky, unethical or at worst fraud or
misappropriation..

The ACCC in their consumer protection framework acknowledges that `silence can be
misleading' such as when important details relevant to a consumers decision are not
mentioned. With misleading conduct penalties being a key part of the ACCC consumer
protection tools.

### Therefore it is surprising that the proposed legislation and supporting material simply ignores omission as if it bares no relationship to misinformation/disinformation. Omission of key information can cause risks of harm and can threaten democracy in the same way as misinfo and disinfo.

This could be due to oversight, or provide additional evidence of poor methodology in
ACMA's supporting research and papers. It could also be intentionally avoided. It may
have been deemed too complex.


### 10.2 Omission: the most widely used method to mislead the Australian public


A compelling political reason for ignoring omission is that historically it is the most
common method of information control that is used to intentionally mislead the
Australian public.

There is some anecdotal evidence that;

### in recent years in all mainstream legacy news media there appears to be a blanket ban on open debate, detailed criticism, dissenting viewpoints but most importantly alternative policy pathways surrounding Australia's foreign policy.

While the reasons are unclear, it may be that Australia's intelligence or national security
interests discourage such debate. It may be that the discouragement comes from the US
Government or on their behalf.

The omission of important information, in this case open debate of opinions on
Australian foreign policy options, leads to a situation of stasis, an environment where the
status quo or established policy is allowed to continue unchallenged.

An example of a valuable, necessary open debate regarding Australia's foreign policy
and looking at alternatives, involves weighing benefits and costs of Australia's UK/US
alignment versus adopting a neutral foreign policy or a policy of independence whereby
Australia will get involved in multiple alignments if they benefit the interests of the
Australian public. For example applying to join BRICS as Saudi Arabia and Indonesia
have done recently. Sadly a debate or even a viewpoint that contained arguments like
this will never be permitted on our already tightly controlled mainstream channels.

In our example of foreign policy; omission of open debate or omission of arguments that


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 41 of 93**

challenge status quo policy leads to a very dangerous and unhealthy situation for a
sovereign nation. In effect the omission of alternative viewpoints and absence of lively
debate about Australia's foreign policy on mainstream channels, misleads the Australian
public that there is unanimity on the status quo policy or that there are no alternative
policies that exist.

No, here the Australian people are misled by omission, that our US/UK alignment is
above politics, unanimous and is without criticism. This is done because it advances
various interests to continue to mislead the Australian public – eg: US & UK
Governments, Foreign policy establishment, defence establishment and intelligence
establishment who are used to working with each other and US military suppliers who
provides our over priced national security hardware.

### The truth is in our foreign policy example, that the omission of information does not involve just a single category. The Australian public are misled because anything detrimental to or proposing an alternative path to Australia's close involvement and alignment with US and UK interests is omitted from mainstream channels. It is not open for debate.

In fact later in this submission we will show that nations that do attempt to go their
own way are relentlessly punished by the psychopaths running enforcement for the
Anglo American establishment.


### 10.3 Omission: Australian public fed disinformation about our US/UK partners for 25 years


Contrary to the misleading narrative that fills the information space of the Australian
public,

### The Anglo American establishment that we are aligned and enmeshed with became increasingly immoral, unethical and blatantly criminal in its activities globally. The Anglo American establishment whilst unchallenged hegemon spent the last 35 years in exploitation of smaller nations around the world. It routinely used threat, coercion or violence to control and exploit other nations while forcing them to allow their natural resources to be exploited by global partner corporations.

Most importantly it uses these methods to forcefully open up national economies to
allow entry of aligned and partnered global corporations, forces the elimination of trade
barriers that protect domestic industries and insists on banking and finance
restructuring to allow exfiltration of investments without restriction. Taken together
these measures result in the looting of a smaller nations wealth and resources along
with the destruction of their industrial and manufacturing base, making these countries
reliant on imports of finished goods from trusted partners of the RBIO.

Worse still is the second phase whereby a looted de-industrialised nation requires loans
to stimulate its devastated economy. Here, the Anglo American establishment has
ensured the creation of a system of global `assistance' via the IMF and World Bank.
Loans are provided on condition that nations privatise their state owned enterprises and


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 42 of 93**

assets and the financial aid is strictly to be used to pay debt not invest in infrastructure.

Thereby the aligned and partnered corporations have the opportunity to buy that
nations railways, ports, airports, roads, energy systems and even their public health
assets for next to nothing and run them as commercial ventures. Nations are rarely able
to rebuild after such parasitic attack.

These truths are far from the narratives sold to the UK, US and Australian public.
However, Increasing numbers of the public in the US, UK and Australia are beginning to
understand why most of Africa, South America and parts of Asia are still living in
intractable poverty and starvation despite trillions of dollars of `assistance' provided to
them over decades. More and more members of the public can see that these nations
were never meant to succeed, they were to be broken and exploited, their wealth and
resources exfiltrated via the City of London and Wall Street and into the establishments
top elites accounts..

### Anyone doubting the Anglo American establishment are simply a criminal cartel perhaps isn't aware that Joe Biden stole $7.5 billion in Afghani gold on deposit in the US. at the time of the US withdrawal. We are told it is pay victims from 911 families. This will never happen, it's complete lies, it has never been in the news for over 12 months. The gold is likely already divided between leaders in the Anglo American establishment. This perfectly illustrates the fraud of the RBIO...

Most Australians know intuitively that many of the `facts' they are presented with via
the media or other information channel make no sense. They know that `something
else is going on' that causes the vast and never solved economic and social
problems in many nations around the world. However most Australians would also
be shocked at the depths of greed, immorality and criminality that our partners in
the Anglo American establishment have engaged in for profit11.

### 10.4 Omission=Disinfo Australian public misled about exploitation of developing nations


Meanwhile the nations at the sharp end of the rapacious and exploitative behaviour of
the Anglo American establishment fared much worse. Their people eventually
discovered the system imposed on them by the RBIO was designed to assist those
exploiting and exfiltrating their nations resources. Following the so called rules left only
lost hope for a brighter future.

The predictable result being a large reservoir of resentment building among the people
of the developing nations. The RBIO they were sold into and engaged with in good faith
was nothing more than a facade of fairness erected more for the exploiting nations own


11 One of many examples; West Papua was denied nationhood in the 1950's and 60's due to it having `no


economic viability'. Instead Indonesia was allowed to annex it. In fact as has been revealed in documents West
Papua has vast oil reserves discovered by the US in the 1940's and the information suppressed until a
compliant regime was installed in Jakarta allowing Standard Oil to exploit oil including one well that produces
26,000 barrels of pure high grade oil per day and Freeport Mining to exploit the worlds richest gold mine
again in West Papua. Denied nationhood, lied into annexation and then looted by US companies. This is how
the Anglo American establishment operates its RBIO


-----

public. Behind the RBIO facade was nothing more than a criminal scam enforced by
military expeditionary forces ostensibly in the region to fight the never ending `war on
terror'. But really in place to protect the interests of Anglo American establishment
elites and their `investments' 12

### 10.5 Info War: Misinfo in media on French ex colonies in Africa ending ties.


France, part of the EU and a long time colonial master of vast swathes of Africa
represents an interesting case study in modern exploitation techniques.

### Even when granted independence, 14 African nations have remained indebted to France since liberation in the 1960's. Part of the debt is the reimbursement to France for colonial infrastructure. Further, each nation was expected to sign an agreement which allowed trade with France, the `protection' of the French security state and required use of a French backed currency pegged to the Euro. However the banking Agreement was pure exploitation - each nation was required to store a massive 50%
 - 65% of its total currency in the French central bank. Access was only allowed to 15% of their own reserves in any given year, if more was required it was only available as a loan (from their own reserves) with commercial interest rates paid to the French Central Bank. As well, they can only have a loan (from their own reserves) which totals 20% of their public revenue of the prior year.

The information above is fact, but it also provides important context. If we know the
facts we can judge events related to those facts. If we do not know those facts we have
no context to judge actions involving France and its ex colonies in Africa. A good
example is the way the so called Libyan uprising was reported and the large scale
disinformation operation that ensured there was no context except the lies that justified
the removal and murder of Libya's much loved leader President Gadaffi

### The global disinformation operation fed to Australians through 2010 and 2011 repeatedly lied that Gadaffi was killing his own citizens and this was why France led military operations to remove him. The fact is, Libya was Africa's richest nation from it's oil reserves and was in the advanced stages of releasing a gold backed currency - the Dinar to allow African nations to free themselves from the oppressive French central bank rules that controlled their currency. Had Gadaffi proceeded, the impact on the French central bank would have been significant. Former French President Chirac had already stated “We have to be honest, and acknowledge that a big part of the money in our banks come precisely from the exploitation of the African continent.” Clearly it was enough of a threat to green light military attack.

Important to note that even today Libya is engaged in a civil war, is no longer Africa's
richest nation, its gold and oil reserves long ago looted. Slave markets operate openly
and human trafficking provides income to the war lords fighting in the civil war.
Protecting the French Central Bank and its currency reserves was judged by the RBIO
worth millions of lives and the destruction of Libya.

NEWS UPDATE: Niger military has removed the French aligned political leadership and
declared that gold and Uranium exports to France are forthwith banned. Which may
pose a significant problem since France is almost totally reliant on nuclear energy and
sources almost 25% of its Uranium from Niger. Also Mali, Burkino Faso and Nigeria, all
recently rid of France themselves have pledged joint military protection of Niger.

### 10.6 INFO WAR: Disinfo and misinfo around African geopolitical re-alignments


The sudden unexpected series of coups in west Africa removing French aligned
governments and the military transitional leaders taking serious steps to remove French
influence, language and further exploitation are evidence of momentous geopolitical
shifts.

Given the vast disinfo campaign the Anglo American establishment maintains over the
Australian public such tectonic shifts are shocking because the public have no real
context to judge them in. The reasons why 4 west African nations have taken a radical
step to remove French influence is because of the extreme exploitation of their
resources. Also that the military forces of these nations feel emboldened to act because
they have seen Russia stand up to the threats and weapons of NATO in the Ukraine.
Increasingly the Anglo American establishment is being seen for the paper tiger it is.

Sadly the Australian public will continue to be misled by the vast misinformation
and disinformation operation in place by government (read intel and national
security) that ensures the available information space reinforces the lie of the RBIO
and other falsehoods hiding the real reasons for continuing poverty in Africa.

Given the level of vitriol and demonisation of Russia by state propaganda, it has
proven challenging for the Anglo American establishment to provide credible
explanation for the sudden appearance of Russian flags, Russian colours used in
fashion statements and a general adoration in Africa of President Putin. Recently
`liberated from French colonialism' nations also invited Wagner PMC to assist in
their security and in eliminating the various wholly owned by western intel Islamist terror groups that threaten their stability.

Is it any coincidence that the appearance of Islamic terror groups have often resulted in
French and US military intervention in the region? These nations watched how the terror
groups spread through Syria despite US military intervention, until Russia intervened
and their military forces along with Wagner PMC displayed a ruthless efficiency in
subduing the terror. People are right to sceptical about the US military motivation and
capability to solve insurgencies. They have proven to be ineffective in Iraq, Syria and
Afghanistan.

Again, these perspectives, these actual events and legitimate reasoned
conclusions are missing from the Anglo American establishment's vast cloud of
disinfo contaminating the Australian public's information space.


### 10.7 Public can access truth only by wading through cesspool of state lies & omissions


How effective is the disinformation and misinformation operation that misleads the
Australian public? A good example is the suppression of dissenting views, like for
example General Smedley Butler, a highly respected US Army General who wrote and

broadcast extensively in the 1930's as a warning to the public;

### “I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”13

Sure you can find his books and broadcasts if you search online. However very few
Australians will know of him. Even fewer will know of his message and warnings, which
are as true today as when he wrote them. The difference is there will be no 2023
Smedley Butler. Such dissenting information, completely at odds with the misinfo/disinfo
narrative of lies fed to the Australian public 24/7 is simply omitted. It is suppressed,
never seen or heard.

### 10.8 Omission=disinfo Australians misled about the decline of our US/UK partners


The Australian public is materially misled, mostly by omission,and are unlikely to see
reporting that our Anglo American partners and the colonial empire nations of the EU
are now beginning to face the consequences for treating much of the world with
patronising contempt while exfiltrating their wealth and resources, not to invest in their
own nations, but flowing into Wall Street and City of London accounts of a tiny subset of
elite super shareholders.

Former US Ambassador and respected foreign policy expert Chas Freeman, who
represents the Realist school of international affairs recently stated this about the lawless
behaviour of the US 14;

### De-dollarization is part of this evolution. It remains a work in progress but has been accelerated by apprehensions generated by the U.S. and European confiscation of Iran’s, Venezuela’s, [Afghanistan's] and Russia’s
 dollar and gold reserves. These seizures made a mockery of the fiduciary responsibilities of central banks. They underscored the reality that the United States and its Western allies now make and break the rules of the post-World War II international order as they see fit. They raise serious doubts about the extent to which dollar deposits will remain reliable

### stores of value.

The wholesale looting by the Anglo American establishment and EU cronies, for the
exclusive benefit of a tiny minority of elite insiders, combined with the refusal to invest
significantly in their own higher wage nations, has resulted in a classic parasite/host
result. Yet the information space of the Australian public will not reflect in any
meaningful way, the dire future we face unless major changes are made to our
geopolitical alignment and economic policies.

Chas Freeman also very efficiently explained the petro dollar agreement that underpins
the Anglo American establishment military and economic power. However, he has
understated or perhaps has not observed the rapid rate that nations are dropping US
dollars and reverting to more convenient currencies for bi lateral trade.

### Still, despite the increased risk attached to holding dollars, for now the petrodollar agreement of 1973 remains in force. This agreement enabled the dollar – having just become a fiat currency no longer backed by gold – to continue as the universal medium of transactions in commodity markets, like energy and raw materials. Under it, the Saudis – and by extension, other members of OPEC – agreed to maintain their currency reserves in dollars and to reinvest any dollars they received for their oil in the United States. The resulting ability of the United States to print money rather than export goods and services that balance its imports is both unique and the basis of American global primacy. But the indefinite perpetuation of the “exorbitant privilege” conferred on America by such monetary hegemony can no longer be taken for granted.

Against this background of major geopolitical change, the English speaking public, the
Australian public included, is not only controlled politically by the declining power but
subjected to it's vast disinfo and propaganda operation.

The implication is that any attempt to forge a more independent future free from the
dead end policies of our rulers will need to happen in an environment whereby the
Anglo American establishment will undertake a full spectrum of measures to stop the
changes and use their existing disinfo operation to smear and discredit any government
and leadership attempting such changes. Bravery is required and there is no evidence
that this exists in our political leaders and not in our bureaucracy. Instead we have
infiltration of elite servitors, acting against the best interests of Australians in the hope
of gaining some international sinecure or promotion opportunity.

Australia is literally handcuffed to a declining criminal cartel - RBIO, Anglo
American establishment, G7 – the name is not important. The activities of that
racket has benefited a tiny elite, however their activities have predictably resulted
in the vast majority of people in the world, the remaining 87.5%, now turning their
back on us.

### 10.9  The numbers show the economic decline of Australia and our partners


### Over the past 20 years, the share of the G7 nations in the world economy (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Great Britain and the USA) has decreased from 65% to 44%.

In that 20 years, a handful of nations (called by some the E7) have taken up the G7's
decline in GDP to become the economic powerhouses of the near future. According to
PwC 15 by 2040 the G7 share of the world economy will be half that of the so called E7

(China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Mexico and Turkey).

### For Australia, hitched as it currently is to a declining hegemon, our future looks bleak. The same report expects Australia to fall from 19[th] largest GDP to 28[th], below South Africa and above Argentina.


# 11. AUSTRALIANS: GASLIT & MISLED ABOUT OUR ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.


### 11.1 Australia's history as victim of imperial abuse.

Australia has always been the the junior, abused partner in our relations with the UK and
US. The vast government and media control over the information space available to
Australians ensures this type of story is kept to a minimum, is told within strict
parameters and never has any follow up or resolution. It is in the interests of the Anglo
American establishment to keep the relationship below the threshold of anger. At this
point in time, precisely because a an increasing number of nations are looking to
distance themselves and move closer to the developing nations bloc – called BRICS
(Brazil, Russia, India and China).The Anglo American establishment will not allow
Australia to also do so. The optics of a an 83 years long ally walking away would be too
damaging.

So Australians can expect that any narrative or info that would likely damage the public
opinion of the alliance definitely will be suppressed. Historical stories of abuse, because
they are like folklore, are harder to manage. While the narrative is less likely to be overtly
suppressed there may be other manipulation such as making it hard to share such
content or covertly suppressing reach and number of views.

Also, our available information space, tends to present controversial Australian historical
content with most of the context removed. This goes for our education on Australian
history also. It is purposefully distilled down to a series of historical snapshots which tell a
safe uncontroversial two dimensional story, Our history reduced to set of archetypes and
tropes

The vast government disinfo machine ensures only the approved narrative is heard. The
detail is generally suppressed.

Therefore this submission now provides the important context surrounding some
historic events that fundamentally shaped and acted to suppress Australia's
economy and wealth. When context is provided it allows proper conclusions to be
made about whether our relationship has been healthy and beneficial or an
abusive one.


### 11.2 Australia, loyal but abused subject: sacrificed its youth, cheated on wool and wheat


Australia went to war in 1914 for King and country, lost 60,000 out of a population of
3.5 million (the highest per capita loss of any nation). In part due to our troops being
led by British Commanders, who attained rank by way of family title rather than ability
or experience. In such a class conscious military it was normal to display an arrogant and
callous disregard for the working class foot soldiers and worse for colonials they led. In
the senior ranks and those planning and leading war operations incompetence was only
matched by refusal to take sound advice. For example, First Lord of the Admiralty
Churchill's vanity, carelessness and disregarding of expert advice and detailed
intelligence reports reporting the futility of an attack on the Dardanelles, did so anyway,
resulted in 27,000 dead and wounded Australians at Gallipoli alone. For no military,
strategic or political benefit whatsoever.

The fact that Australians were likely killed unnecessarily as a result of the Incompetence,
hubris, inbreeding and general psychopathy of the British elites infesting the command
structure of the British Imperial and expeditionary Forces was tragic. But simultaneously
Whitehall bureaucrats and politicians secretly cheated and profited at Australia's
expense while knowing the huge cost in blood and money colonial loyalty to empire
was costing our very young nation.

The UK bought in advance the entirety of Australia's annual wool clip and wheat harvest
for the years 1915 and 1916 locked in at the much lower pre war 1914 prices. They then
proceeded to on sell them to the US at the much higher market price, making a
substantial profit. At this time, in order to provide the level of military assistance being
demanded by the UK, Australia was required to take out a series of massive loans, in
order to equip and ship our army to France. These loans were made at the height of
war and came with very high interest rates.


### 11.3 The Niemeyer plan to ensure debt repayment and de-industrialisation


After the war despite ongoing negotiation, the UK refused to provide any relief on the
high interest rate the war loans were set at. By the time the Great Depression was
beginning to hit Australia with collapsing commodity prices, there was open talk of and
debates in state parliaments about the urgent need to stop the war loan repayments or
at minimum postpone the repayment of interest on the war loans. Unemployment was
skyrocketing and vast numbers of Australians were being evicted from their homes,
living in shanty towns and reliant on hand outs to feed their families.

the federal government. Niemeyer conducted a several months

economic position was greatly worsened by the co-ordinated press campaign leading up

to Niemeyer's arrival. This view, valid or otherwise was obviously suppressed in the
dominant media of the day...

### The effect of this deliberate and unpatriotic propaganda upon public credit and private enterprise was deplorable. Confidence in the future of the country was badly shaken, the share market, already depressed...almost collapsed. The press campaign did incalculable harm.

And of Sir Otto Niemeyer himself and the interests he represented;

### The heads of the governments of Australia  seemed to have been overwhelmed at the honour of sitting at his feet...When he spoke to them as a school master talks to children – telling them, the elected representatives of the people of Australia how they ought to govern the country, they sat in respectful silence.

 If Sir Otto had represented the British government the position would have been different. But Sir Otto represents a private bank. He represents not
 the people of England but great financial interests...the Bank of England

Nowhere was it reported across any of that vast campaign of press articles, that Sir
Otto was the consultant of private bankers. Nowhere was it mentioned that the Bank of
England was a wholly privately owned entity. Everyone had been misled to believe the
so called `old lady of Threadneedle street' was an institution of British government
equivalent to the department of treasury. All reporting on the Bank of England, was
designed to give that view. However the truth was, up until the post world war two
Atlee government, the Bank of England, which held such tight control over the finance
of the colonies and afterwards of Australia was a privately owned, for profit, trading
bank.

### When understood in this context, with omitted facts revealed, the Australian public is able to understand better the reality facing them, the reasons why events have proceeded as they have and most importantly, with all the information available to them, make reasoned and intelligent decisions about how to best proceed in the future.

In 1930, the private bankers, the elite interests of the Anglo American establishment
were using the Great Depression as an opportunity to take control of Australia's
economy - ending investment in manufacturing, industry and infrastructure so Australia
would be unable to make its own products and instead forced to continue importing
expensive British finished goods. Their aim was for Australia to be a low cost supplier of
crops and mined resources – the raw materials Britain would use to create finished
goods.

Of course the plan was for Australia, like African nations in later decades, to be forever
trapped in debt, paying for those finished goods as imports, working longer and harder
and thus driving the price of the raw materials ever cheaper.

### Sir Otto wants us to scrap our policy of building up Australian industry  and to confine ourselves to producing raw materials. And in order to do this... [...profitably, because commodity prices had collapsed and Sir Otto warned they were unlikely to ever return to their previous prices] which he tells us is our only economic salvation, we must reduce our standard of living.

 [Sir Otto, the representative of private bank interests intends...] we are to produce the raw materials for Britain's industry – and in order that Britain may be able to compete in the markets of the world, we must produce them cheaply - the cheaper the better...This is Sir Otto's policy in a nutshell...reduce our standard of living and work harder so that we may produce more raw materials at lower prices –

The Australian public were misled by the reporting on the Niemeyer plan, it was
misinformation and disinformation. Instead it was reported that by accepting 5 to 10
years of lower standard of living and higher output, our economy would begin to turn
around because we will have lowered our debt.

Our State and federal governments agreed to adopt part of the plan only. In order to
continue to honour Australia's war loans and make repayments, they enacted policies to
reduce Australians overall standard of living and increase productivity. Given the high
and increasing unemployment the Great depression was inflicting (over 25%), Australians
suffered to ensure the war debts were paid on time. However, thankfully our government
continued to develop an Australian industrial base so when the depression began to
lessen, economic recovery was able to meet increasing demand for goods with
domestically produced goods rather than the more expensive British made imports.

have recovered. Instead the renewed demand for goods would have resulted in the
nations meagre income flowing back to Britain in payment for imported products.


### 11.4 Jack Lang Premier of NSW fought the bankers and was removed


NSW Premier Jack Lang was the only politician to ignore Niemeyer and place his
citizens interests above the interests of the Bank of England. Lang refused to pay
interest on the war loans, sending the principal amount only. The federal government
caved in to pressure and paid the NSW interest amount. In the political deadlock that
followed, a shadowy fascist street gang emerged called the new guard and with threats
of violence and civil disobedience greatly assisted the interests of the Bank of England
by creating an air of lawlessness and chaos in Sydney which in turn gave cover and
justification for the NSW Governor to terminate Premier Lang's royal commission to
lead the NSW Government.

The big fella 1.93 metre Premier Jack Lang and NSW Governor Sir Phillip Game who
removed him.

Premier Jack Lang was sacked, despite being legally elected and hugely popular. By
the time of the new election, the NSW public had been subjected to months of
misinfo/disinfo and smear campaigns aimed at Lang and published relentlessly in the
daily press. By election time the volume of lies aimed at Lang did their job and he was
defeated.

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”

Huge crowds came to hear Jack Lang in Sydney's Moore Park

Two examples of the disinfo campaign run by Anglo American establishment
interests to smear Jack Lang, falsely discredit his policies and ensure he was never
again elected. Professionally designed advertisements and expensively printed
“starvation debentures' valued at `one Lang'

Australia honoured it's loans and the Australian people suffered terribly from 1930 to
1935 There are strong arguments that vast regional areas across Australia never
recovered and never became viable as a result. The investment of human and financial
capital in those hundreds of settlements wasted and allowed to fall to ruin.

Some may argue the treatment of the Australian public was legitimate and required.
However the fact remains that they were subject to misinfo and disinfo, propaganda and
omission used to remove important context.

Is all of this an example of the abusive relationship Australia had with the Anglo
American establishment? Well, consider what transpired soon after the events just
described...

The UK did not honour its own war loans to the US and in one of the greatest acts
of hypocrisy we never are told, stopped making repayments in 1932, only
commencing again due to great pressure in the 1960's


# 12. WHY NOW? THIS ISSUE IS NOT A NEW ONE.


### 12.1 Legislation and regulatory framework pretend issue is new


So called misinformation and disinformation are not some new phenomenon created
and made real by the digital network age. They have existed since humans began
civilisation. In Australian terms one only need to make a few hours study in
trove.nla.gov.au of our newspapers throughout our colonial and early federation period
to see the proliferation of doubtful and completely false reporting.

It therefore comes as no great surprise that ACMA elected to narrow the frame and
boldly state that “...online misinformation and disinformation are relatively novel and
dynamic phenomenon...as if the issues of misinformation and disinformation have never
existed, never been widely published or broadcast and have emerged without warning
or precedent on the digital network.

ACMA then takes pains to wrestle with this never seen before issue admitting
that :...there is no established consensus on the definition of either term...”. As if there
ever could be a consensus because one persons disinformation is another persons
secret Government program. Only the passage of time and multiple FOIA applications
will decide the truth.

ACMA came close to exposing the real aim of the laws when it stated in its code of
practice document that disinformation and misinformation are activities which;
“... propagate information that threatens to undermine established democratic
processes...”

### In fact the laws and the urgency behind them are to protect established interests by suppressing any information that conflicts, argues against or threatens those established interests.

Despite false exhortations describing the current digital age as unique in terms of the
threat and spread of misinformation and disinformation, in the days prior to radio, TV
and the digital net, the actual numbers of people engaging in newspapers, the number
of and widely disparate view points of those newspapers, the fact that Australians had
no other source of information about current events and the relatively low population of

Arguably much more than any particular channel of information via the internet.

Any suggestion that the internet makes the issue of misinformation and disinformation
any more urgent, threatening or dangerous than at other periods of Australian history is
frankly risible and unworthy of serious merit 16

This entire project has deliberately over-simplified a very complex, and nuanced
subject that is not new and never uniquely sprouted from the internet. It has existed
in different forms and become part of Australian history and folklore (think gold
rushes, newspapers, fake gold deposits and investment opportunities see trove
newspapers via NLA.gov.au).


# 13. POLITICISING COVID TO BE NEW 9-11


It is predictable that those advancing this legislation have used the opportunity that
COVID provided to further the interests that benefit from even greater control over our
information space. These people, after all, are not imaginary or visionary, they are simply
servitors following orders and they pay no regard to whether they are working against
the best interests of the Australian public.

### "The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, re imagine, and reset our world" - Klaus Schwab,
 World Economic Forum.


### 13.1 COVID and the strict information control has divided Australian society


Aside from the pandemic as a public health issue, it has created an unbridgeable divide
in Australian society with one side aligning with the public health bureaucracy and the
other with fundamental rights and freedoms.

Those who side with the public health bureaucracy over COVID19 often find it difficult to
understand how any rational person could oppose the assumed authority and science
bolstering those bureaucrats. Well here are some reasons why public health bureaucrats
did themselves no favours and lost the trust of a significant proportion of the Australian
public.

### Billions were spent over decades to protect us from pandemics, it failed and there has been zero criticism, apology or accountability for that failure...why?

 Public health officials adopted a tone that spoke down to the Australian


16 In the 1930's radio was the dominant medium for information in the US. This was displayed in 1939 when

Orson Welles added an innovative element to add drama and realism to his War of the Worlds” radio play. The
dramatic reading was inter-cut with fake live news breaks describing the martian invasion. Vast numbers of
people believed the news reports and there was reports of widespread panic in communities right across
America. This event proved the power and reach of radio at that time. Digital networks are simply too
dispersed and cons mers to cann to e er ha e a repeat

### public and to many people they appeared to enjoy the added powers and media spotlight the health emergency gave them.

 Public health officials immediately adopted an authoritarian, mocking tone over ordinary Australians' researching treatments in good faith, remembering that for 9+ months public health had nothing to offer for early treatment of COVID19. They had nothing and the public reacted to the information vacuum by going online. The behaviour of politicians and public health in castigating the Australian public was not only counter- productive it was a shameful and divisive act that has never been addressed.

 Public Health officials did not credibly address why there was a blanket ban on early treatment therapeutics when it became public that MRNA vaccines could only receive an emergency use approval if there were no existing treatments. This information was obfuscated and lied about, in many cases public health officials and bureaucrats amplified non existent disinfo and misinfo whenever the emergency use approval facts threatened to be exposed. .

 Public Health officials did themselves no favours by continuing to push for additional doses of vaccine when it was generally known that doing so provided no protection from infection. Many had by this stage lost all trust in public health as it was simply acting irresponsibly in order to try and use up the massive number of vaccine doses our Government had bought.

Sadly, but unsurprisingly COVID19 has been politicised by malevolent politicians
and bureaucrats and used to accumulate power and wealth 17 These activities have

been largely enabled by a compliant legacy media and social media

### 13.2 COVID and 9-11: opportunities to restrict freedom.


The campaign pushing for this legislation will seem familiar to anyone 45 years and
over. It is basically the same playbook as 9-11. A terrible event, an unspecified culprit.
Public must be protected from harm, freedom must be traded for safety, privacy must
be traded for security. Freedom and privacy are never restored, even after the `so called
threat' is long passed.

COVID19 is regularly cited as proving the need for control of the information space due
to allegations of potential harm threatened by COVID19 related info/disinfo...ACMA has
clung to COVID19, in its supporting papers and cited COVID19 in a case study.

The people advancing this legislation and the interests they act for are nothing if not
predictable. They appear to have a limited ability to plan and execute complex
operations and so simply repeat the same plan using different components

The Australian public is right to be wary of and cynical towards public officials using
COVID19 as justification for enacting restrictions on our freedoms.

### Whereby `the terror threat' was used over and over to justify intrusive surveillance and inconvenient security measures at airports etc. Every single erosion of freedom and privacy was executed and justified as necessary to protect us from the threat of harm. The justification for misinfo/disinfo laws are to protect us from the threat of harm.

 After the threat subsides there is never any debate about withdrawing or removing the measures. There is a general expectation that these intrusions and restrictions on our freedom will remain permanently.


### 13.3 The truth about COVID not set in stone, will continue to be revealed


Contrary to the misguided belief of a good many people, the story of the COVID19
pandemic is not set in stone, it represents an ongoing fight for transparency, truth and
fact. Many of these were in short supply during the pandemic with public interest in
them dismissed. The public instead ordered to accept as faith whatever information the
government provided. Which is an unacceptable manner to approach democracy and
governance.

### Those still critical of members of the public who question government actions and decisions, railed against arbitrary and authoritarian restrictions and are sceptical of government generally, need to reflect on the fact that their own inaction is viewed as no better than those who stood by in silence in Nazi Germany as freedoms were taken away and eventually over time became atrocities.

Given the fact that in the depths of COVID NSW's premier was in fact later determined
to have made potentially corrupt decisions. That in many many instances long after the
fact, we will discover maladministration, corruption, incompetence or inappropriate
behaviour. It is far more prudent for the public to be sceptical and questioning, than
blindly showing unquestioning obedience.

vast databases that can link the efficacy of existing, even long discontinued medications
and provide a fast shortlist of potential treatments to new or novel infections and
diseases. Yet this entire apparatus apparently became `the dog that did not bark' at the
beginnings of COVID19. - why? Never answered as yet.

### 13.5 Waiving usual 10-15 year vaccine trials – Emergency usage approval


The solution that was eventually provided 9-12 months later was an experimental
vaccine MRNA, using new technology that had not gone through the usual trials
process that lasts 10-15 years before approval. There was also no manufacturing
facilities to produce the new vaccines at the scale public health officials wanted, which
was global. A massive investment was required to quickly build multiple large scale
plants, however the return on that investment would be massive, in the order of a
tenfold profit within 2 years. - This process and those behind it has lacked transparency


### 13.6 Emergency usage approval: dependant on no existing treatment available

A significant legal/regulatory barrier for allowing the experimental MRNA vaccine to fast
track and thereby avoid the decade of trials, was that there cannot be an effective
existing treatment. If an existing treatment is effective or even has positive results the
experimental vaccine would require the standard 10-15 years of trials.

### The exact details of the who and how are still unknown, but they will become known before too long. What we do know is that simultaneously, doctors and researchers began to post online about success they were having locally with certain existing medications and ordinary people found hope and spread the information. However a decision was made to fast track MRNA vaccines and this required a massive investment in manufacturing facilities to be part of the global roll out. From that moment any effective existing treatment had be suppressed.


### 13.7 Corruption around massive investment in vaccine and suppression of treatments

A global information (in fact misinformation/disinformation is more accurate) operation
swung into action to protect the massive investment in MRNA vaccine manufacturing.
The operation was tasked with the global control and manipulation of the information
space available to the public worldwide. Those advocating particular therapeutics
showing success against COVID had to be discredited 18 and smeared, the therapeutic

had to have its credibility destroyed by authority figures or by `designed to fail' trials or
studies 19

omissions that have filled the information space in the interests of protecting the massive
investments in MRNA vaccine mass production. Each exposure adds more evidence
proving the misinfo/disinfo that threatens the public with harm is the opposite of that

cited. It is those promoting lies in order to protect elite MRNA investment interests.


### 13.8 Political usage of COVID to allege misinfo/disinfo is ill advised.


While the legislation lovers have collated and filled tables with all kinds of examples of
alleged COVID19 mis and dis information, which stretch from the sublime to the
ridiculous. Caution should be exercised. It is likely that their allegations of
disinfo/misinfo are themselves the misinfo/disinfo..

The entirety of facts and truths are not as yet released or available. It is premature to be
making final judgements on COVID related info.

It is worth noting that the NIH (US National Institute of Health) has transitioned
several times in their online advice for an anti malarial treatment that a large
number of doctors has stated was effective in reducing early COVID symptoms.
Over 2 years they have changed from a strong categorically negative advice. To
today, which is lengthy review of a considerable quantity of clinical data,
acknowledgement of trend showing it as effective in early treatment. But ends
without a yes or no but a strong maybe yes and awaiting further data and trial
results. By any metric this would have received a misinformation designation, when
the likelihood is it will in the near future be found effective.


# 14. INFORMATION IS FLUID & NON BINARY


## There are no facts, only interpretations. Friedrich Nietzsche


### 14.1 ACMA inappropriate body to investigate and issue finding on this subject


ACMA not appropriate body to investigate such broad issue.

### ACMA is not an institution devoted to philosophy so it lacks the intellectual or academic credibility required to adequately investigate and respond to a subject as vast, complex and nuanced as `information'.

Particularly in relation to evidence of harmful interactions from a societal standpoint of
designated information subsets; `misinformation and `disinformation'.

The predictable result of commissioning a regulatory authority to investigate and report
on such a vast, complex and nuanced subject as `information' was the resultant report
and recommendations;

### An ill defined issue described in overly simplistic terms, allowing the actual cause and real culprits to be misattributed back to the general public and

### the actual culprits given exemption.

 14.2 Legislation flawed: assumes information is binary and static rather than fluid over time

Putting aside the fact that ACMA chose to ignore government and media as the source
for the vast majority of so called misinfo and disinfo, ACMA did not have the capability
to produce a credible conceptual framework from its investigation and this has resulted
in a fundamental flaw in the basis of the project and this flaw has flowed on to the
proposed legislation.

The basic premise of the legislation and the regulatory framework

### has the flawed assumptions that; information is a binary object that can be categorically determined as true or false...

 and a second flawed assumption that; once determined as true/false the information remains so and not subject to other information that may necessarily lead to this determination changing. In other words, it assumes information has a static rather than fluid and dynamic property.

The assumptions that operate around this legislation support an information space
whereby truth and fact become binary issues and their determination as such is frozen
in time based on information available at the time of determination.

This is however a very simplistic way for a society to deal with a complex and nuanced
issue.

### Information can have multiple degrees of validity depending on who is interpreting the information and their environment, exposure to previous information and context the information is provided in.


### 14.3 Qualifiers: Information can be either true/false with important `but for' qualifiers


Most importantly a binary true or false designation discounts any nuanced or deductive
thought process. For example information can be true or false but for...which indicates
that qualifiers can override an initial binary designation.

### Eg: The statement “...without grape vines, there would be no wine” is
 true, but for the ability to make a kind of wine from other sources for sample by fermenting fruit or rice.

 Anti malarial medication as a therapeutic treatment for early COVID symptoms is misinformation, is true, but for Lancet retracting a study disproving efficacy, a number of papers claiming efficacy in process of peer review and awaiting publication and an

### extensive report from NIH which does not state it has no efficacy states it cannot endorse until more data is available 21.

 14.4 COVID: Rushing to determine info as true/false will be proven fallacious over time


For example, today's alleged COVID19 misinformation could well be proven as true
by a peer reviewed paper tomorrow afternoon.

While facts relating to some issues may be self evident and unchanging, in many, many
cases facts may only be determined on available information.

### Given the scale and proliferation of Government and intelligence agency isinformation and disinformation, in many cases vital information is suppressed, made secret or otherwise withheld from FOIA release and does not become available for many years.

The risk in this legislation is that counter arguments to Government disinformation
will itself be labelled as misinformation until relevant information becomes public.
The exposure of such information at a later time will not only discredit the
Government but undermine the legislation and determination framework. Obviously
this creates added motivation by Governments' to suppress and withhold important
information from the public for longer.


# 15. LEGISLATION FORMALISES FOREIGN CENSORSHIP


### 15.1 Allows & encourages ad hoc censorship by foreign social media monopolies


In effect this legislation subcontracts censorship to the silicon valley cartel and it's social
media monopoly.

### FACT:Almost every successful venture launched from silicon valley has been financed by InQTel a venture capital fund wholly owned by the CIA. Indeed knowing which companies will succeed is a sure fire way insiders profit from risky tech ventures.

The social media giants that this legislation will grant power to and encourage to censor
the Australian information space are an important component of the Anglo American
establishment and its narrative control mechanism. The recent Twitter release has
exposed how these social media giants collaborate and collude with US intelligence and
FBI to suppress information and opinion that does not align with establishment interests.

**G. St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 63 of 93**

### 15.2 Social media is censoring and suppressing on behalf of US government


Even worse, recent public disclosures have revealed a veritable network of US agencies
and non profits engaged in multiple projects aimed at censoring information deemed
to be against the interests of the US. Government agencies and non profits have been
exposed as actively suppressing debate and content in favour of one political candidate
and to the detriment of the unwanted candidate. Effectively using
misinformation/disinformation programs to interfere in political debate in the months
before an election 22.

Clearly any Australian legislation that enables the information space available to
the Australian people to be controlled, censored, suppressed or manipulated by
US interests is at the very least completely against the best interests of Australia
and the Australian public.


# 16. NO CREDIBLE AVENUE FOR APPEAL OR REPEAL


### 16.1 Legislation and regulatory framework will not protect public from wrongful censoring

There is no proven nor effective way that Australian legislation or regulatory compliance
framework will protect Australians from being wrongfully censored or their content from
being wrongfully or erroneously labelled and misinfo/disinfo.

All of the tech giants have proven their lack of engagement with the public by under
resourcing their front facing access points for correcting errors or attending to
complaints. Even in terms of business and dealing with advertising, the tech giants AI
will often arbitrarily flag content as not meeting guidelines when it does. However the
process of trying to get a human to review and respond is time consuming.


### 16.2 AI will increase wrongful censoring

The increasing use of automatic systems driven by AI and the deliberate lack of human
contact points will exacerbate this issue.

Because this proposed legislation provides no credible and detailed mechanism for
appeal against wrongful labelling as mis/disinformation it shows that the stakeholders
promoting and drafting it have no interest in safeguarding and protecting truth and fact.
This legislation is and always has been about censorship, suppression and control of
inconvenient truths and permanent control over the information available to the
Australian public.

Any credible good faith drafting of legislation such as this would contain multiple

safeguards and protection against mistaken, wrongful and corrupt use of the
powers the legislation confers. This bill exposes those responsible for it as enemies
of free speech and working against the interests of the Australian public.


# 17. LEGISLATION DRAFTED WITHOUT AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT


### 17.1 No evidence this issue was researched in Australian context.


ACMA has also failed to investigate and then provide any Australian context to the issue
or its relationship in Australian society. Why is this important? Because very few
Australians live in a huge country and they have always dealt with the isolation by
engaging with information. From yarns around the water tank to newspapers and then
magazines and now online, Australians have always been one of the top information
consumers worldwide.


### 17.2 Australia has long history of living with disinfo/misinfo


Australians have also been dealing with widely published misinfo and disinfo long before
federation. A review of Trove online archival database via the National Library of
Australia site, gives a good sense of how gold rushes through the 1890's and early
1900's caused a proliferation of mis info and disinfo, all widely published and often
causing harm. The newspapers of gold rush regions at the time are filled with speculative
venture offers that seem to good to be true and probably were.

This issue of misinfo and disinfo is not novel, not somehow worse due to digital networks
and not as harmful as the campaigning around this legislation alleges. The threat to
Australian democracy is the same as the disinfo and rumours that swept Australia about
racial issues or big power colonisation in our neighbourhood in the early 1900's.


### 17.3 Australians can tell lies from truth – if not subjected to 24/7 info operation


Australians do not require government whom they no longer trust, to pretend to protect
them from disinfo and misinfo. Australians are quite capable of determining truth from
lies when shown both. When bombarded by lies which they are now and which this
legislation will legitimise Australians are deliberately misled.

While certain politicians and bureaucrats show more allegiance to the globalist
mindset promoted by the think tanks and supranational bodies they are members
of, we are still a unique sovereign nation. ACMA failed to provide any research or
information about how disinfo and misinfo interacts in Australia society and the
unique challenges around the issue here. Such research would show that Australians
throughout history tend to be sceptical and cynical and rather less likely to believe
misinfo and disinfo than those pushing the legislation like to suggest.

### 17.4 Australia's Historical and Geopolitical Context.


Australia has a long history of vibrant and diverse public debate on issues both trivial
and vital to the Australian nation and Australian people. There has never before been
such a sinister, unwanted, unnecessary resort to censor public debate on the scale of
this proposed legislation. As a result, there has never been a more insidious and
perfidious threat to the free flow of information and public communication available to
the Australian public as this proposed legislation.

In the most threatening of times, when passions ran high and the public were divided in
opinion, open and free expression of divergent opinions was not only a sign of a
healthy and advanced democracy, it was a ready way for politicians and bureaucrats to
sense the mood of the Australian public 23. The very public they are meant to serve.


### 17.5 Australians want many things from government BUT NOT THIS


The Australian people want a Bill of Rights, the Australian people want the nations
public debt reduced, the Australian people want investment in infrastructure that will
benefit future generations. The Australian people never asked for misinformation
legislation, yet this is what we get. Each elected Government performs the same tired
routine of ignoring the issues important to the Australian people while instead foisting
unwanted and unneeded legislation like this upon us.

The entire issue of so called misinformation and disinformation is yet another example
of elected federal Government and Canberra bureaucracy pursuing policy and
legislation for largely unexplained reasons and where there is no actual public demand
for such intervention.

This issue and the proposed legislation, along with others issues like the digital ID are
policies being driven and imposed on the Australian people not because they are
wanted, needed or have been clearly mandated by their being central to any political
parties platform. These issues are originating externally and are being driven by
bureaucrats and strangely they tend to find bi-partisan support.

Observant Australians are already questioning where such policy agendas come from.
The so called misinformation disinformation issue may have been mentioned in
electioneering along with a myriad of other issues and promises. It certainly was not a
central plank upon which any Government was elected. It is not a pressing issue for the
vast majority of Australians. No mandate has ever existed for this legislation.

In fact part and parcel with a loss of trust in Government, many Australians are
concluding that unneeded and unasked for bi-partisan policy agenda such as the so
called misinformation, disinformation legislation are most likely originating from and

23 In 1938/39 The Waterside workers Federation of Australia refused to load crude or `pig iron' onto Japanese

vessels in protest against Japanese militarism and their war in China. When an English vessel appeared and
it became known it was transporting the iron to Japan, further boycotts and a great public debate flourished.

affairs P blic o tcr and nicknaming Men ies `Pig iron Bob' res lted in a Go ernment ban on iron e ports

being driven by intense lobbying and pressure from domestic or international interests.
In the case of this legislation it is part of a co-ordinated push across the Anglo American,
G7 and EU nations for similar laws.

**The vast majority of Australians neither want nor see the need for any Government**
**intervention in relation to so called misinformation or disinformation. Given the co-ordinated**
**push for similar laws across the G7 and EU, this legislation shows the extent our democracy is**
**policy captured by unelected and most likely international interest groups consisting of various**
**think tanks, global corporations and intelligence agencies. For example the WEF.**


# 18. THE INFO PLAYING FIELD IS NOT EVEN


### 18.1 Public at big disadvantage, documents & evidence withheld


Having waded into the area of information, allegedly to protect the Australian public
from so called misinfo and disinfo, yet another major issue left ignored is the massive
imbalance in power and access there is between government and public.

In any situation where the public challenges government, the public is already at a
significant advantage. All the evidence is usually in the governments possession. Even
honest governments fight tooth and nail to block public access.

In the new info world created by the legislation and regulatory compliance framework,
whereby decisions are made to suppress, censor and remove whole threads or argument
from the public view after they are deemed disinfo, There is no additional mechanisms
available to the public to access evidence that may refute the designation of particular
info being disinfo.

The playing field is already far from level, yet absolutely no consideration or mention is
made of this in relation to new information, misinfo and disinfo rules and protocols.

Put simply the proposed legislation is simply more weapons directed at the public,
against these weapons the public has no chance to prove its case because the
existing information rules favour the government and are barriers to public
transparency.

# 20. RUSSIA AFRICA SUMMIT: CONTROLLED. ANTI PUTIN, MINIMISED


What are the chances that 3 purportedly
independent, separately owned
publications all choose to run a headline
alleging low attendance at the Africa
Summit, denigrating Putin, pushing the
impression Russia is isolated, minimising
the impact and importance of the event?

In the MOD's undeclared, silent info war,
media coverage of anything Russia related
will be tightly controlled and run by `desk'
or special task force. An event as important
as the Africa Summit hosted by Russia in St

Petersburg, will attract the highest priority include many more stakeholders.

The angle, framing and language will have received intense attention and be overseen
by cabinet ministers, senior bureaucrats, other stakeholders from all over Whitehall,
along with the military hierarchy with a unit like 77[th] Brigade and involving input and
approvals from senior roles in all the services along with UK intelligence. Once the first
article is approved, the subsequent ones will be written up in the style of its publication
using agreed minor variations in language or order of facts. However, it is quite clear that
MOD's info war footing means a story like this is too important to leave to chance, it is
centrally controlled information.

# 21. RUSSIA AFRICA SUMMIT: COVERAGE vs FACTS


### 21.1 Co-ordinated headlines allege low attendance (false)


Summit 2023 site states 27 heads of state attended with 48 out of 54 represented.

Summit 2019 site states 45 heads of state attended with all 54 represented

In reality, it was true that less leaders attended, but clearly sending the second highest
leader is equivalent so in effect 27 countries attended with top leadership and an
additional 21 nations officially attended with low ranking representatives.

In fact it is hardly the dismal failure reported. Russia is in an armed conflict it is natural
that a number of heads of state stayed away. However their nation was still officially
represented so there was no snub, no diplomatic cut.

Economist alleges just 17 African leaders attended down from 43 in 2019
Guardian alleges just 17 African leaders attended, far fewer than 2019
Time alleges only 16 African leaders attend, less than half the number who attended in
2019


### 21.2 Why the need to feed disinfo to the public (Australians included)?


The western media had an agenda to minimise the importance of the event as well as
continue to create the impression (false) that Russia is isolated (false) and leaders are
reluctant to come (false) and the chosen spin was to report the lower total of leaders in
attendance and imply the summit was a failure..

The fact that this same angle was co-ordinated and run across many media channels
shows the importance of maintaining certain disinfo narratives regarding Russia and
ensuring these are broadcast on many channels in order to become the dominant
message that the UK, US and Australian public will find in their information space.

In this case the disinfo narrative is that Russia and Putin are isolated. When in fact the
opposite is true. The reason such importance is attached to portraying Russia as
isolated is that a multitude of economic sanctions were placed on Russia in early 2022.
While the intended effect was to cause significant damage to the Russian economy to
cause a slowdown, recession, goods shortages and huge loss of income. There was a
number of poorly thought through effects which caused blow back on the economies of
the west (including Australia) but particularly the EU economies.

Because Russia exports huge quantities of oil and gas, cutting off Russia from export
markets resulted in big price increases globally for energy which remain high even
today.
Secondly, supply chains which were still recovering from the COVID disruption were
againdisruptedwithRussiabeingblockedfromexportingandimporting.Therewere


-----

# SUBMISSION: Proposed legislation “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
**Gregory St. James Ferguson** **1[st] August 2023** **Page 70 of 93**

shortages of many items leading to price increases and combined this has caused a big
surge in inflation across western economies and as a result central banks were forced into
a series of interest rate rises through 2022 and 2023.

All western economies have suffered from shortages, big increases in energy costs, high
inflation and a big jump in interest rates which are due to the large scale economic
sanctions placed on Russia.

Our friends who believe they are in a silent info war believe it is crucial to feed lies and
disinfo to the public (Australia's included) to mislead them about Russia being isolated so
that the sanctions they have suffered from at least have been effective,

They do not want and will at all times suppress info that shows Russia is far from isolated
and enjoys trade and diplomatic relations with many nations, in this case 46 African
nations.

They (MOD) believe if the public discover the true ineffectiveness of the sanctions, it will
mean the financial pain that has been inflicted on them is for nothing. And that the
public will likely find reason to despise government even more than they do now (true).

Of course these elites with their inbred incompetence are so pig headed they could
never face admitting their error and removing the most damaging sanctions to their
own public.


## 22. STATE MIS/DISINFORMATION – LIES YOU BELIEVE ARE TRUE


We will look at some ways the Australian public have been fed government falsehoods
and disinformation with the result being that we hold false beliefs. In each case,
government created disinfo was distributed widely in order to present a false impression
or fake narrative explaining particular events in a manner that advanced the interests of
the Anglo American establishment

It is only later, assisted by whistle blower admissions, public release of documents or
leaking of them to media that facts are exposed leading to the discovery of lies.

The government holds all the cards in this game. They can continue to peddle lies and
suppress evidence that would allow them to be discovered. Only time and fortuitous luck
allows that evidence of government malfeasance appears in the public domain.


### 22.1 Common disinformation we believe is true


## That the second Gulf War in 2003 and US invasion of Iraq proved US military ascendancy and weapon system superiority over a much larger conventional army with outdated operational doctrines and previous generation weaponry.
In fact it proved nothing of the sort. The CIA & special forces had

conducted an operation prior to the invasion and bribed key Iraqi generals
not to fight The result was that US forces were met with large numbers of
surrendering Iraqi's before any shot was fired. There are only rare examples
of actual combat.

## With both major parties in Australia supporting mandatory offshore detention for Illegals entering Australia by boat, this divisive issue is now resolved.

## Recently The Brereton Report found credible information of 23 potential killings that may constitute war crimes carried out by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The killings are alleged to have been carried out by non commissioned ranks and the report specifically cleared all levels of command of having any knowledge of the war crimes. Both the ADF Commander and Minister for Defence stated that criminal charges may be brought against those responsible, that the actions of a few should not tarnish the work of the many who served to protect us against terrorism and assisting the Afghan people to maintain freedom and democracy.
**_As usual, all blame is laid at the feet of individuals, which allows corrupted and_**
**_compromised politicians and military commanders to escape without accountability..._**
**_However, there are a large number of veterans and legal experts arguing that this_**
**_attempt to scapegoat lower ranks is legally wrong and immoral and cowardly._**

These are three isolated and reasonably recent examples. What should be taken away
from these examples is;

1.Both Australian major parties lie to the Australian public.
2.The US military has no experience in modern peer combat operations
3.Australia's top military commanders are incompetent moral cowards
4.The Australian public is subject to state created disinfo in order to mislead

us

In any discussion about misinformation and disinformation there must be an
acknowledgement and discussion about government being a very important source in
proliferating misinformation and disinformation to the public. The fact that legislation has
been presented without even an acknowledgement of this fact, is an unacceptable
misuse if not fraudulent use of government funding to then mislead and deceive the
government in its submissions..
