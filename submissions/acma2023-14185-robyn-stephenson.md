**My submission** **_against the “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting_**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.”**

I think it is ridiculous that the federal government is wasting taxpayer’s time and money on
this bill. How Orwellian to have a Ministry of Truth! I thought Australia voted in politicians who
live in the real world, not some sort of dystopia…? Because if this Bill is passed, then we will
most definitely be living in a dystopia!

Surely the last 3+ years have already determined that the government got it VERY wrong with
covid, as plenty of excess deaths and scientific papers will attest to? To allow the federal
government, especially the tyrant government headed by Albanese (where he got the
Governor General (GG) to swear him in with but 20% of the vote counted, so he could fly off
to that Quadrilateral meeting in Japan), to try to determine the truth for this country, when
truth, honesty and integrity are not even ON their list of credentials, is ludicrous.

We have a Referendum coming up later this year and it should be pointed out that the
government ONLY wants us to vote YES and doesn’t want to give us the other side of the story!
But that is not the government’s job. They need to give us pros and cons for it and let we the
people decide. Otherwise we’re living in a tyranny (which could be closer than you think when
one looks at how Albanese took the Prime Ministership: he & the GG didn’t think they needed
to worry about what 80% of the voters thought!). Even for the Republic referendum years ago,
we were at least given the same number of pages each of pro vs con for that one.

So, after 2-3 years of the governments saying ‘safe and effective’ for a ‘vaccine’ that is
evidently not that at all, illegally taking the reins of the prime-ministership, actively trying to
stop anyone speaking out about The Voice (and denigrating them if they do), we now come
to this interesting bill titled “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.”

Do I think a bill like this is going to miraculously make people speak the truth? No.

Do I think the government should have such wide powers based on the wording in this Bill?
No.

Do I think that an almost $7 million fine is appropriate for having something posted wrong?
No.

Do I think the government should be going after the digital platforms rather than the
individuals/companies who have written certain news articles etc? No.

BUT, do I think this Bill will bring much fear? Yes.

Do I think the word “truth” will start to mean “truth as the government determines it to be at
the time”? Yes.

Do I think this is one of the most stupid and dangerous Bills ever to come out of a government?
Yes.

To allow the government to shut down ANY digital platform means Australia could turn into
China, where the government can determine what we do – and don’t – have access to. How
are people going to learn anything if they’re kept in the dark? How are going to thrive as a
country? We won’t. We can’t. We’ll be thrust back to the Dark Ages!

Already it’s hard enough to learn how to be a decent health professional, because Universities
have been ripping pages out of lecturer’s notes for years, but it’s getting very difficult to speak
the truth to your patients as a health professional, because places like AHPRA have been taken
over by paper-pushing bureaucrats who have no idea how the real world works, and wish to
limit us so we say only what THEY want us to say. Now we have the federal government
wanting to drag us further into darkness with this new Bill. There is too much darkness in
Australia to stand idly by and let Bills like these be passed!

This Bill is not merely a waste of space and a waste of money. It has been specifically designed
to demand adherence to whatever the government wants and is a truly chilling bill. It has
NOTHING to do with the truth, or even combatting ‘misinformation’ – just things the
government doesn’t want us discussing! And anyway, whatever happened to open
discussions?! Why must things be outlawed instead of discussed?! What’s wrong with
agreeing to disagree?

This is NOT the sort of Bill that deserves a place in a democracy. I am sick and tired – even
angry – of all this power-grabbing. What about focussing on legislation that the people really
need right now, like how to address their health issues or their financial problems? People
don’t need Bills like the “Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.” No-one does. Only a Totalitarian society needs
a Bill like this, and that is exactly what we will become if this is passed. This Bill MUST be
stopped.
