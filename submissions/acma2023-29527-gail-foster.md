Misinformation Bill August 6, 2023

This proposed bill is an excellent example of both misinformation and disinformation. The terms
‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ are grouped together without delineating the definitions of
either.
The term ‘serious harm’ is not defined and can therefore mean anything that ACMA and the
government of the day decide. In 1930s and 40s Germany, pointing out that Jewish people had
human rights would have been seen as disinformation.
What about the serious harm which will occur to those who are discriminated against because they
disagree with the acceptable narrative?
How have you decided to enforce discrimination against anyone with a different view to the current
acceptable government story line?
Please explain how we will have any freedom of speech which is necessary for democracy if only
government propaganda is allowed?
Please explain how 5 members of the ACMA authority have the right to tell every other Australian
what they can and cannot say?
Please explain how government, ACMA and other bureaucrats, public schools and universities and
the ABC and allowed media sites will be allowed to say what they like while the rest of the
Australian population will be silenced?
What will be next, censorship of the written word, books, speech in our own homes?
The proposed fines are obscene!
How will this proposed legislation guarantee religious freedom? Anyone who does not believe in
abortion, transgenderism, gay marriage will be a target.
I note that ACMA authority members have experience in media, economics and law. How do these
backgrounds fit them to make decisions in such areas as sexuality, climate and vaccinations all of
which have been censored over the last four years?
Australian adults do not want or need our views dictated to us. We are not children and we will look
after our own safety!
How will any Australian have a say on ‘the voice’ in the proposed referendum if they are
effectively silenced through the proposed misinformation legislation?
How will indigenous people have ‘the voice’ if their voice contradicts the government narrative
(story/lie)? Warren Mundine and Jacinta Price have already discovered bullying and vilification for
daring to have a different view on ‘the voice’.
This draconian attempt to silence and intimidate the Australian people is bullying! We have laws
against that but apparently it is okay for the government to bully to get their way. Government
members and bureaucrats are public servants not public dictators!
