Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Committee Members,

### My name is and I am a male who isEyears of age. I am happily married to my wife ofdyears, and we
have-amazing and very loved children.

### I have lived all my life in this beautiful Nation of Australia, and I appreciate the freedoms that I have been able to enjoy
throughout my life. These freedoms have been challenged in the past, on global stages, and people of all ages and
sexes have paid the ultimate price in the fight to maintain them. It is for this reason that I am submitting this email. We
have come close to losing those freedoms in the past and it would appear that throughout the world there is currently
a battle going on in many nations over this very thing ... Freedom.

### I am a Christian, and part of what Jesus the Christ told us to do is to love all people, even those who are against us. In
fact, the book of Romans, chapter 12 verses 9 to 21, written by the Apostle Paul to the Roman christians, comprise
instructions for how we are to conduct our lives, in love. It includes: "love must be without hypocrisy"; "abhor what is
evil, cling to what is good"; "bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse"; "live in harmony with one
another"; and "do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good", as well as much more.

### Do christians get it right all the time. Unfortunately no, however this is the Standard we are to aim for. Our battle
should never be against other people; rather against the forces that influence people to do what they do. As
christians, we are told to love, and that is why you (should) never hear of a person who calls themselves a follower of
Christ, attacking someone who is of a different religion or belief system to themselves. Now, what we are called to do
is to stand up and fight for righteousness. This is not just a biblical or christian 'theme', but one recognised by all those
who live in a democracy:

"Democracy implies that the man must take the responsibility for choosing his rulers and representatives, and for the
maintenance of his own 'rights' against the possible and probable encroachments of the government which he has
sanctioned to act for him in public matters". [Ezra Pound, "ABC of Economics," 1933]

The rest of this email submission is a template, provided by the people at Canberra Declaration, after much research
into the components of this proposed Bill. The last sentence though, before my name and address, is not just a wild
statement, but a well recognised issue under a communistic regime. I am currently reading a book called "Auschwitz
the Nazis and the 'Final Solution" by Laurence Rees, and a comment he made on page 64 of this book caught my
attention.

The officer Hoess, who was instructed by Himmler to construct and operate the camp, had a whinge to Himmler that it
was difficult as they were short of everything. Rees says, "What is significant about this exchange is not so much
Himmler's response to Hoess's grumbling, but more that Hoess felt able to talk to the head of the SS in this way at all.
In the Soviet system anyone who talked to Stalin or Beria (head of the NKVD secret police and Himmler's nearest
equivalent in Moscow) in such a manner risked their life. Strange as it may seem at first sight, the Nazi leadership
tolerated much more internal criticism from its supporters than did the Stalinist system. And this is one reason why the
Third Reich was the more dynamic of the two political regimes, with functionaries lower down the chain of command
free to use their initiative and voice their views".

In no way am I comparing the current, or any past, Australian government(s) with either the Nazi or Communist
regimes, however the freedom to air your views, even if they are not popular or accepted, is a right that all people
should enjoy. It is just not an available freedom though under a communist style regime.

Therefore, this proposed bill to combat "misinformation and disinformation" must be wholly rejected.

### If the last three years during the pandemic have taught us anything, it's that top-down, heavy-handed approaches by
governments ultimately do not promote trust in our institutions but degrade it. Public trust in our governments and
media outlets is low, evidenced by the decreased primary vote for the two major political parties and slumping media
ratings.

This bill will achieve the opposite effect of its intended purpose. Its authoritarian approach will decrease trust in our
governments. This will prove disastrous for our country and will foster disunity.

One very concerning aspect of the bill is that content authorised by the government would be exempt. It is incredible
that a government would be willing to make a law and exempt itself from that law. This bill proposes one rule for the
government and a different rule for everyone else. Such contempt for the Australian people the government is
