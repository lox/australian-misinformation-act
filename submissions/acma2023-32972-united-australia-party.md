# WHO WILL BE THE ARIBTER OF TRUTH ?


-----

## Who will be the arbiters of truth ?

Under the proposed legislation, which individual or individuals will be all knowing and wise enough to
operate without scrutiny or criticism, that possess special powers to be the sole arbiter’s of truth,
uncoloured and undistorted by their own passions and interests -with the wisdom to deem what is and
what isn’t “misinformation” ?

Alternatively rather than search for such omnipotent individual, maybe it is best to take heed of the advice
of leaders from the past …..

_“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies,_
_and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an_
**_open market is a nation that is afraid of its people." – John F. Kennedy_**

_Now, why is this freedom [of speech] of real importance to humanity? The answer is that what appears to_
_be today’s truth is frequently tomorrow’s error. There is nothing absolute about the truth. It is elusive. In_
_the old phrase, “it lies at the bottom of a deep well”. It is hard to come at. So few of us have objective minds_

_- detached minds - and what we conceive to be the truth is very often coloured or distorted by our own_
_passions or interests or prejudices. Hence, if truth is to emerge and in the long run be triumphant, the_
**_process of free debate - the untrammelled clash of opinion - must go on. – Sir Robert Menzies_**
