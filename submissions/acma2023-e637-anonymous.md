## Submission:

Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission on this ACMA proposed legislation. It is
probably a statistic of significance that I have never before written to the government, or a
member of parliament, before in my years of life. This demonstrates the level of

importance I place on my submission, and the need to convey clearly my objections to the
legislation, because of the risks and threats it poses.

Firstly, there must be some agreement on common foundation principles, for without such
commonality in societal organisation, and the governance of society based on them, we
cannot function as a free, open, liberal and democratic society. (Of course, oppressive
regimes can force into existence anti-liberty and anti-democratic dystopian society. Stalinist
Soviet Union and Mao Communist China are historical examples that oversaw four million
Ukrainians perish in the Great Famine and tens of millions who died in the Great Leap
Forward.) A liberal democracy needs to be based on a set of rules designed to ensure that
government rests on the consent of the governed. It does not inherently dictate what
policies should emerge from government, or what social arrangements should be tolerated
or prohibited. There are many principles, such as the concept of natural justice – that a
person has the right to a fair representation of their defence, and be allowed to counter
accusations against them; and for example, in legal matters, a fair trial, the presumption of
innocence until proven guilty, the right to face their accusers; and so on. Many books have
and will be written on the topic of what is at the foundation of a free and open liberal
democracy. Justice to this topic cannot be expounded upon here, but the point is that there
must be a foundation of principles adhered to by society, if it is to remain free, open and
democratic.

In the opening lines of the Infrastructure Department’s website calling for submission on the
proposed ACMA legislation, it is claimed: “misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to
the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”
This threat may be real, but the proposed ACMA legislation is an even greater threat, with


-----

many risks, to our democracy and society (and as a secondary effect, the economy, because
there has never in history been a failing open-liberal-democratic-society with a successful
economy). (As an aside, oppressive societies, such as the Roman Empire, can flourish
economically, but you have to allow for unjust institutions, such as slavery, for that to occur.)

Leaving till later an alternative means to treat the problem from misinformation and
disinformation; first addressed is how the proposed counter to mis- and disinformation is a
greater threat is shown. It is a simple proposition:

1. No one has ever, in the history of the world, had a monopoly on the truth.
2. To legislate about, and implement policy for misinformation or disinformation,

requires an assumption that the truth can be known. The legislation defines
misinformation or disinformation to be “content that is false, misleading or deceptive”,
along with other criteria. And there it is – it is impossible to deny the logic – the
implementation of the legislation will require a determination of what is “false” (and
thus what is “true” must also be known).

3. It is impossible to deny the logic – that no one can have omnipotent knowledge (or a

monopoly) of the “truth”, and therefore the regulation of information based on a
government determination of the “truth” is not implementable, and therefore cannot
achieve the intended outcomes.

The intended outcome is the “regulation of untruth”; but because “truth” and the “government
endorsement of the truth” may not be the same thing, then the only logical conclusion is
there is a risk that the outcomes becomes an Orwellian 1984 “Ministry of Truth” scenario. It
is a clear argument that the government, elite, professional expert, scientist, king, ruler,
priest, or whatever authority, declaring something to be true, which is actually false, will
never make it true, and visa-versa. The implementation of the principle of “government
endorsed truth”, detached from actual truth, is embodied in the dystopian society of the book
1984, with the Ministry of the Truth deciding yesterday’s falsehood to be today’s truth. Likely
many submissions will link this legislation to Orwell’s book, 1984; such that it need not be
elaborated further here.

One can recall that at one point in recent Australian history, Lindy Chamberlin was found
guilty of killing her own baby, based on forensic expert opinion; only to later be overturned,
because that forensic evidence was actually incorrect – or false. Once it was considered
true that the Earth was flat; and the Sun revolved around the Earth. These historical and
incontrovertible – without controversy – examples demonstrate the deductive logical fact that
any total or monopolistic claims on the “truth” are potentially problematic. And to be clear,
the legislation must put ACMA (the government) in the position of being the arbitrators of
what is true, and what is false.

Under a liberal democracy, legislation makes no claims on “truth”. It is Australian law that we
drive on the left side of the road; but it is not true that driving on the right side of the road is
wrong – many countries successful legislate contrary road rules about which side to drive
on. The side of the road we drive on is not a “truth”, it is a rule. The outcome is an
organised society. To some degree, citizens forgo a freedom (in this case, the freedom to
drive on the right side of the road) to achieve a valued outcome (we all don’t die horribly in
regular head-on collisions). There is no “truth” about speed limits. Driving regulations for
speed limits are a compromise of costs and benefits. A political party in government that
decided to reduce road deaths (the benefit) by limiting all road speeds to a maximum of 10
km/hr (an exaggerated cost for the purposes of demonstration) would likely be removed at


-----

the next election in a democratic society. The cost to society of this regulation would be
more than the democratic constituency could accept. But note, there is no right or wrong
side of the road to drive on, and no “true” speed limit. The best a government could do
would be to use statistics to derive evidence of the optimum trade-off between speed and
road fatalities; and note that if circumstances changed (e.g., driverless cars proved safer) the
evidentiary statistics, and the road rules, would need to evolve with the changes.

The ACMA legislation in question is on an entirely different philosophical level. It is not
saying we think this is “best” based on the evidence, and therefore we will impose this
regulation. It is saying we thing this is “true”, and the regulation we will impose is to limit the
ability for counter-opinions to be openly discussed. This is clearly a direct attack on a
citizen’s freedom to dispute the position of the government. Going back to the example of
the 10km/hr speed limit, if the government said “10 km/hr is the right and true answer to
society’s ills”, and no citizen is then allowed to express an opinion counter to that view, then
exactly how will there be a free and open election resulting in a demonstrably bad
government being thrown out of office? (Again, the example is an exaggeration for the
purposes of demonstration.)

Examples of “flat Earth” and “10km/hr road speed limits” are intended to demonstrate what is
the tip of an iceberg. More recently, there have been many controversies over medical
advice and government’s restrictions and policies from the COVID pandemic situation of
2020-2023; or climate change science and policies; or regulations about trans-women
competing in women’s sports. It would be difficult to use these as examples, due to their
contemporary, contested and controversial situation; however, these are the types of topics
the government may move to regulate – and indeed recent examples of claims that
government interventions against mis- and disinformation have already occurred, are being
made in the newspapers at the moment. As clearly demonstrated by my 10km/hr speed limit
example, government regulation of the freedom of speech and thought, are clearly antidemocratic. Even if “misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and
wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy”; its regulation
proposed through this legislation is a much greater threat.

Now to come back to the problem the legislation intends on treating: “misinformation and
disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our
democracy, society and economy”. There is no argument that this is not the case. An open
and free democratic society depends upon the elite experts to contest ideas in the public, so
that the society can adjudicate and elect representatives who will make policies, or the
society freely makes its social arrangements (with or without government intervention), over
what is tolerated or prohibited, according to the will of the people. Having bad actors inject
false information is going to disrupt the operation of the contest of ideas. Emergent
properties from “big tech’s” social media platforms can also disrupt the process. In a sense,
even the legacy media in Lindy Chamberlin’s case acted as a positive feedback mechanism,
such that opinion polls were used to gauge the court of public opinion (in this case, an early
majority agreeing on her guilt, solely on the basis of the lady’s composure and speech). So,
the problem has existed for a long time – and some anarchists and Marxists might argue is
the reason to not have democracy; for democracy is just the election of the politic
representatives based on public opinions that may be misled, or false, or irrational, or
illogical, etc. The only feasible cure for the problem is the freedom to disagree, to argue the
counter-point, and persuade the electorate of the better way. This is generally termed
freedom of speech, and the freedom to elect the representative that best agrees with the


-----

public opinion. In addition, it is well known from counter-terrorism and other citizenship
studies, that education is a counter to opposing information.

Note here the carefully avoidance of the term “false” information. As already shown, the
proposition of true and false needs to be contested freely – unless we wish to go down the
Orwellian 1894 road. Generally, in politics the arguments are not factual, but are competing
on a values basis. If one values freedom and a democratic society, one will be against this
legislation; but a person can hold the opinion (and obviously the ACMA proponents and the
government do) that it is a better value to fight the scourge of mis- and disinformation, even
if it risks instigating an authoritarian “Big Brother – Ministry of the Truth” outcome. I argue
that the value of freedom, free speech, and a better functional democracy, is more important
than the problem and cure proposed by the legislation. The other side might argue (if I
imagine their philosophical position) that my analysis of the deleterious and inevitable
consequences towards a 1984, dystopian, authoritarian, and anti-democratic government is
wrong. My opponent might presently argue all they like! But imagine if government
legislation forbad then from entering into the argument, that the government endorsed my
opinion as “true”, and if they enunciated their arguments (now classified as mis- or
disinformation), then they would face legal or criminal penalties. I can only think that the
proponents of this legislation support it because they hold to the fallacy of believing in their
own infallibility – they cannot imagine that the legislation can (and it will) be turned against
them. (The same mistake befell many leaders of the French Revolution, who later lost their
heads to the guillotine. 15,000 to 17,000 were guillotined across France under the Reign of
Terror.)

Citizen’s education for children, immigrants, and adult Australians, can be designed to offer
what is philosophically “western enlightenment”. Agreed that such education policy holds the
risk of a bad government using it as a propaganda tool – which means once again the
government falsely propagandising what is “true”. But a proper classical, liberal, education –
maybe like the multicultural education programs by the governments in the 1970s to 1990s
addressed tolerance to counter racism against immigrants – can instruct on the civic duty of
the citizens to engage and discern the arguments in the market place of political ideas. To
demonstrate the idea, if criminals were scamming citizens out of their money, a government
education program would highlight the issue – be that cyber security awareness, or whatever
the con. If bad political actors are scamming with bad political arguments, governments and
the oppositions might collectively lift the standard of the national conversation and provide a
more mature and honest competition of ideas, in contrast to what is found in the “gutters” (as
they are called) of social media. (This might be why by convention referendums are
accompanied by a formal “Yes” and “No” case, facilitated by the government of the day.)

In conclusion, because mis- and disinformation required the discernment of truthhoods and
falsehoods, and as no one has a monopoly on the truth, the proposed legislation is
fundamentally flawed. It is arguable that parallels are found between the legislation putting
the government in the position of regulating what is true, and George Orwell’s book, 1984. A
government deciding on what is true and false is the greater threat to democracy, not the
availability of contested competing ideas. And even as mis- and disinformation can be
harmful, the problem it is better treated through civic education – although that is not without
the risk of a government using education to propagandise for its own political or corrupt
gains. However, at least the public will be allowed to contest those ideas through freedom of
speech, protest against the government, and remove them from office at the next democratic
election, but only if we maintain and protect our free, open, liberal and democratic society.
