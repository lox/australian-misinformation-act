I believe the saying that goes,
"He governs best who governs least".

I believe that in a free democratic society like Australia, we should respect people's right to
seek and find answers to the questions they have. What works for one person does not
necessarily work for another. This is certainly true in parenting, but often also true in
education, health and many other areas of our life.

We don't need the government or other deputed organisations, to be deciding what
information we may have access to except in the most exceptional circumstances. We
certainly don't want these agencies deciding and filtering what is "true" or misinformation
or disinformation. There's often more than one way to approach things or to do things or to
get educated or to get well- let us as adults decide for ourselves please.

I believe it would be best if the government had fact sheets and links to further information
on the current understanding and best practice and left it at that. Government would be
fulfilling their duty of care by providing the best understanding of whatever situation for
people to be informed. The fact that sometimes other people find a different way should
not be confronting. If we had no innovation we would have no inventions. Sometimes
thinking outside the box is appropriate. Some people or situations or groups of people
prefer a different approach.

Also, what actually is best practice or best treatment changes over time. So what could be
regarded as misinformation now could be regarded as truth in time to come and vice
versa. As humans we are growing in our knowledge and experience and our experts
sometimes agree and sometimes differ on best approach. So there is not just one "truth"
and all else is misinformation. If something is not true it will eventually be obvious.

Please treat us as thinking adults rather than children who need external filters on
information. Disallow this bill and please see your duty of care fulfilled in education rather
than legislation for important topics, but leave us free.
Thankyou
