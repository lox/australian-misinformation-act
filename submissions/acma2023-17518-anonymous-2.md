1. There is only one commonwealth and that's the commonwealth of Great Britain of which Australia is a part. It has a
prime minister that is supposed to be put forward by Parliament to be approved by the governor general, the
representative of the crown. This means that Australia under the governance of one system and cannot create its own
commonwealth.

2. The royal prerogative to deny assent was removed in 1688 by Parliament through the creation of the bill of rights
therefore Queen Victoria did not hold the authority of the people to grant assent to any commonwealth nation having
their own constitution as she was a treasonous monarch. So under the correct governing monarchy structure all fake
constitutions are null and void.

3. The Magna Carta 1215 is a democratic common law constitution that recognizes the people as the supreme judiciary
and legislature meaning the people govern themselves through the independence of the jury the judge and annul
government legislation.

4. The 1688 bill of rights took away jury independence so that a government dictatorship could be established..
Colonization began 100 years later therefore the colonies were established on the principles of dictatorship.

5. The 1901 was written by British parliament (a dictatorship) that set up Australia’s parliament as the supreme judiciary
see chapter 71 judicature act. Any system that gives government the power to judge the legitimacy of it’s own legislation
and the power to punish people into compliance is by definition a dictatorship.

6.Australia was setup as for profit outdoor prison whose largest revenue raiser was crime and prisons because
administered by Parliament considering it gave itself the power to write and enforce legislation the interfered with peoples
natural born rights.

7. Back in 1901 the people were ignorant and still are as to the meaning of democracy. They were led to believe democracy
was voting for two wings of the same bird with one agenda. By then voting in elections for a political party was well
established therefore what the people accepted as democracy. Consensus does not change the truth but it does become
what is accepted as truth.politcal parties only began to form prior to the creation of the bill of rights which signaled the
shift of power away from the last governmental failsafe mechanism of the monarch (takes an oath to protect the rights of
the people from government intrusion) denying assent to any legislation that infringes on the people’s rights.

8. Government has the capacity to become criminal in nature by being influenced by private interests and the only
mechanisms that prevent criminal government (royal prerogative and jury independence were removed in 1688.

9. By upholding the 1901 dictatorship people are saying they are bound to the ignorance of their forefathers to
remain a prison colony under government dicta10. The word democracy means the people rule not the people
vote for which flavour of slave master they want to be whipped by. Without jury independence the people are
enslaved. The 1901 is the antithesis of democracy and it's time for Australians to mature by understanding the sins
of the past so they can stop repeating them.

11. Magna Carta 1215 is a restatement of the democratic common law constitution that formed the construction of a
nation state which was sealed in perpetuity making it the sole constitution for the entire British Commonwealth realm
because a legitimate constitution imposes limits on what government can do not the people, so we need to take
responsibility and use the standards government knows it's bound to assert our natural born freedoms therefore liberating
ourselves from government dictatorship. Understanding the principles of democracy contained in the MC1215 is the only
solution to getting government get out of our way and back to its intended purpose of keeping the power on and emptying
the bins.

# Article 61: the full translated text

## “Since, moreover, for God and the amendment of our kingdom and for the better allaying of the quarrel that has arisen between us and our barons, we have granted all these concessions, desirous that they should enjoy them in complete and firm endurance forever, we give and grant to them the underwritten security, namely, that the barons choose five and twenty barons of the kingdom, whomsoever they will, who shall be bound with all their might, to observe and hold, and cause to be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted and confirmed to them by this our present Charter, so that if we, or our justiciar, or our bailiffs or any one of our officers, shall in anything be at fault towards anyone, or shall have broken any one of the articles of this peace or of this security, and the offense be notified to four barons of the foresaid five and twenty, the said four barons shall repair to us (or our justiciar, if we are out of the realm) and, laying the transgression before us, petition to have that transgression redressed without delay.         And if we shall not have corrected the transgression (or, in the event of our being out of the realm, if our justiciar shall not have corrected it) within forty days, reckoning from the time it has been intimated to us (or to our justiciar, if we should be out of the realm), the four barons aforesaid shall refer that matter to the rest of the five and twenty barons, and those five and twenty barons shall, together with the community of the whole realm, distrain and distress us in all possible ways, namely, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, and in any other way they can, until redress has been obtained as they deem fit, saving harmless our own person, and the persons of our queen and children; and when redress has been obtained, they shall resume their old relations towards us. And let whoever in the country desires it, swear to obey the orders of the said five and twenty barons for the execution of all the aforesaid matters, and along with them, to molest us to the utmost of his power; and we publicly and freely grant leave to everyone who wishes to swear, and we shall never forbid anyone to swear. All those, moreover, in the land who of themselves and of their own accord are unwilling to swear to the twenty five to help them in constraining and molesting us, we shall by our command compel the same to swear to the effect aforesaid.

 And if any one of the five and twenty barons shall have died or departed from the land, or be incapacitated in any other manner which would prevent the aforesaid provisions being carried out, those of the said twenty five barons who are left shall choose another in his place according to their own judgement, and he shall be sworn in the same way as the others. Further, in all matters, the execution of which is entrusted, to these twenty five barons, if perchance these twenty five are present and disagree about anything, or if some of them, after being summoned, are unwilling or unable to be present, that which the majority of those present ordain or command shall be held as fixed and established, exactly as if the whole twenty five had concurred in this; and the said twenty five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all that is aforesaid, and cause it to be observed with all their might. And we shall procure nothing from anyone, directly or indirectly, whereby any part of these concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if any such things has been procured, let it be void and null, and we shall never use it personally or by another."
