## Submission in opposition to the 

# Communications Legislation Ammendment

 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
 Bill


-----

This communication is to respectfully register my objections to the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023 (The Document).

My overall objection is that The Document is little more than a collection of vague catchall
statements and phrases each open to a significant number of interpretations as a result of
an almost complete absence of specificity in key areas. This is amply demonstrated in
Section 2 Definitions where neither misinformation nor disinformation is defined.

SOME CONCERNS
The Document is very clear in specifying the responsibility of media platforms to identify
and censor any material that could be construed, or misconstrued, to be misinformation
but does not go as far as to specify what constitutes actual breaches.

The definitions, or lack thereof, of misinformation and disinformation in conjunction with
that of truth are, or should be, at the heart of this proposed amendment but only
generalised "meanings" have been provided. For the purposes of The Document the
"meanings" (not definitions) of misinformation and disinformation are to be found in
subclauses 7(1) and 7(2) but sadly any relationship to a definition is sadly lacking in both
cases (conveniently perhaps) and that of truth is completely absent.

Subclause 7(1)
_(1) "For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is_
**_misinformation on the digital service if :_**
_(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive"_

This part of the "meaning" rests solely on the understanding of the word "false" which is
inextricably linked with that of "truth". As stated previously the authors of this amendment
failed to include a definition of the word "truth" as it would apply to The Document or make
any reference as to who or what body does or will have divine access to all that is "true". It
is entirely consistent then that the word "truth" is not mentioned once (0) in The
Document. This strongly suggests that the proposed amendment is not about truth but
control. The word "false" on the other hand is mentioned fifteen (15) times. Surely this
begs the question "If truth is of no importance why bother creating this amendment
because it protects no one?"

_(b) The content is not excluded content for misinformation purposes_

In order to get a sense of what this point is describing it is necessary to go back to the
Definitions section.

In Section 2 Definitions Line 11 excluded content for misinformation purposes all
exclusions except those covered by the first point relate to content provided by the
government or bodies either accredited or licensed by a level of government or reliant on
funding from the state or federal governments. An obvious conclusion is that there exists
a conflict of interest on the part of media entities preventing them from presenting anything
other than government approved or supported content. Nevertheless all information from
these sources is not to be questioned only that originating from other sources is to be
checked.


-----

Line 30 in the exclusions raises an interesting question.

_"content authorised by :_

_(i)  the Commonwealth; or_

_(ii) a State; or_

_(iii) a territory; or_

_(iv) a local government_

This amendment defines neither misinformation nor disinformation and the words truth and
true (except for a mention on page 30 regarding a "true copy") have been omitted but the
exclusions identified above suggest someone knows that what may be said in the future by
any and all branches of government is to be relied upon as being true (trust us, we are the
government) as is information from dependent media and educational sources as well as
platforms approved by the minister.

The first point (a) is the exception alluded to previously :
_content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire;_

This point returns once more to generality open to interpretation. Given that the audience
judging all content are all media organisations and not a court of law how they are to
determine intent is not mentioned.

There does not appear to be any mechanism or process to determine whether or not
content is "Produced in good faith". No mention of consultation with the source of the
content or a review process. Will there be a mechanism for appeal? As for the specifying
of ". . . for the purposes of entertainment parody or satire" this suggests that any content
produced in good faith (no ulterior motive) for the purposes of educating, informing,
stimulating debate or thought would be censored. Only "fluff" pieces containing nothing to
contradict or question the government narrative would be acceptable.

_(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in_

_Australia; and_

My understanding is that this "meaning" is related to the scope of the process of
distribution and not to a definition.

_(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause or_

_contribute to serious harm_

This point is in keeping with The Document's apparent intent in that it is loaded. It requires
the reader to interpret the meanings of "reasonably likely" and "contribute". As with the
previous two points, this is unrelated to the word definition. Not only is it wide open to
interpretation it requires interpretation / misinterpretation, surmise and a crystal ball rather
than providing a clear basis on which a "reasonable" decision can be made. Thankfully ". .
**. reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm" is covered in 7(3) or so it is**
intended to appear. I will leave it to the honourable members to decide.


-----

Subclause 7(2)
This subclause intended to define the word "disinformation" is a repetition of the definition
provided for misinformation save the addition of an extra condition 7(2)e.

"For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a digital service is
**disinformation on the digital service if :**
_(e) the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the content intends_

_that the content deceive another person._

Once again "intends that the content deceive" requires at least some degree of
omniscience to know if the intention was to deceive. This is especially true given that no
checking process is mentioned. Perhaps the unstated "intention" is that the platforms
concerned work out the details.

[The word "deceive" is defined the Cambridge Dictionary as " to persuade someone that](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/persuade)
[something false is the truth; trick or fool:" Here again the words "true" and "false" are](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/false)
pivotal. That troublesome word "truth" has raised its ugly head yet again and as stated on
other occasions no mention of the word is made in The Document. Without truth as the
deciding factor and by association falsehood, how is deception to be judged?

Please consider this scenario. A person with impeccable credentials, acknowledged by
the world as an expert makes statements relating to their area of expertise. The statement
is supported by irrefutable facts but that person is then accused of deception because a
particular media platforms or governments finds the statements to be inconvenient. Under
this proposal would the person be judged guilty of misinformation?

Such scenarios were common during the recent pandemic and we relied on fact checkers
to inform us of the truth only for it to be admitted later by a social media mogul that what
was claimed to be true by these people was in actuality only their opinion not fact. Will this
proposal lead us down the same path?

POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS

When it comes to truth, the proposed changes are at best vague, ignore truth, the elephant
in the room and fail to address how and by whom (the unmentionable) truth is identified or
decided, but surprisingly clear on what will be considered to be true (or acceptable), what
platforms will be considered "trusted" and the penalties that could / will be applied for
breaches (failure to censor unauthorised truths) by media platforms. It can only be
inferred from The Document that the government department made responsible for
identifying dangerous content may not know for what to look but that they will know it when
they see it.

It is unimaginable that media platforms will be able to interpret the government's
"accredited truth" without additional information not included in this document or access to
omniscience. It appears that one of the document's intentions is to allow an unelected
government (not to be confused with parliament) to set the "rules" but to then distance
itself from the execution of those rules by making the media platforms responsible for
wielding the hammer, thus avoiding any public responsibility for its role. When the many
grey areas are identified by the media platforms they will of course err on the side of
caution and censor the content to avoid the possibility of incurring a fine.


-----

Businesses such as X (Twitter, which prides itself on no censorship) would appear to
currently not comply with this document and so face the difficult decision to censor or
exclude Australians from participating.

CONCLUSION
This amendment is clearly intended to establish the censorship of all information that may
result in the population of Australia questioning the many government narratives
expressed through our parliament. The suggestion that it is intended to protect an
innocent public, incapable of coming to the governmentally approved views without yet
more government assistance, is not only an admission of the failure of our education
system but suggests a much darker motivation.

The very few points raised in this objection represent a small part of my overall opposition
to this document. I am aware that censorship laws like this proposal are on the agendas
of many other foreign governments including new Zealand but if it is allowed to proceed
then it signals the end of Australia as we have known it. The negative effect of the COVID
response on the Australian population was very significant but if this amendment proceeds
the result will be disastrous.

I hope that the expected tide of other submissions expressing equal concern comes to
fruition and that reason will prevail.
