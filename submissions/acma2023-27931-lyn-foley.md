Submission regarding new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

While I understand the concern about the content of some messages in the social media sphere, I
feel that government censorship is an extreme measure which could be detrimental to the freedom
of speech for which we as Australians are renowned. It has been our privilege to express and debate
ideas in the public arena. This has helped us to hone our thinking and understand other points of
view.

Any legislation that places control of free flow of information in the hands of a small minority must
raise serious alarm in the minds of citizens of a democracy such as ours. There is no safeguard about
who that minority will be either in the short or long term. Controlling what is called true and false
information by censorship and silencing is not at all consistent with the principles of democracy
upon which our nation is founded, and on which the health and vigour of our public life depend.

I certainly feel more than concerned. I feel alarmed, and so do many of my friends.
Please abandon this unprecedented move,

Yours sincerely,
Lyn Foley
