I have read the exposure draft of the bill and find it utterly repugnant to me as an
ordinary person living in a country which has a fine tradition of democratic
representative government based on freedom of speech for the people.

I ask that the bill be withdrawn. It is not possible to rehabilitate this odious document
with any kind of amendment.

The problems in my view can be understood as operating at two levels.

**The first level is ideological and conceptual.**

I acknowledge that the spectacular rise in popularity and power of digital platform
services and social media brings with it a responsibility upon governments to
establish a framework within which these platform services can operate to the benefit
of ordinary citizens in Australia.

However the Disinformation bill as proposed is not capable of forming a useful part
of that framework. We already have laws about hate speech, discrimination and
defamation. These apply to any kind of publication.

The simplified outline of the schedule on pages 3 and 4 of the exposure draft
indicates that the purpose of the bill is to …”provide adequate protection for the
_community from misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services.”_

I contend that attempting to “protect” the community from misinformation and
disinformation is neither possible nor desirable.

In order to determine what is or is not “disinformation” somebody somewhere has to
make a judgement call about this. In the mediaeval era this was in the hands of the
high priests who ran a religiously dominated society in which correct thoughts and
beliefs were defined by the prevailing doctrine and woe betide any one who
challenged this.

The reality is that the prevailing wisdom about anything is always subject to revision
as new information comes to light. For this to happen we need a society in which the
expression of new information is encouraged. That means opening the public space
to free expression and debate about views which challenge whatever happens to be
the orthodoxy of the time. In due course the view based on best evidence will prevail
but only if challenge, discussion and debate about that evidence is encouraged in
the public domain.

Consider a current issue:

Are battery electric cars better for the environment than those which burn petrol ?
The current Australian government and governments of other countries want us to
believe the answer to that question is yes but there are many dissenting expert views
with supporting evidence for their position. The only way to resolve the issue is by
ongoing debate in the public arena into which evidence can be brought and
discussed. If we have some bureaucratic high priest who has the power to decide
that one or other of these views is “misinformation” or “disinformation” then we have
abandoned one of the fundamental bases on which democratic society can flourish.

**The second level is the detailed content of the draft exposure bill as published.**

There are so many serious problems with the content of the bill I could not deal with
them all in this short submission. So I will just mention two of them.

If as an ordinary citizen I publish something on a digital platform which the high
priests of correctness, whoever they might be, deem to be “misinformation” I could
be held in breach of the law and fined. But if the government or a government
agency or incredibly, someone producing content in good faith (whatever that
means) for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire should publish the very
same thing then under the bizarre provisions of this draft bill that would be quite
acceptable.

The definitions of harm are so subject to interpretation, again one assumes by the
high priests of correctness, that they are for practical purposes useless or worse,
subject to the whim of the government of the day. For instance what is “disruption of
public order or society in Australia”. This opens the way to the kind of administrative
tyranny seen in countries run by totalitarian powers and is totally unacceptable in
Australia.

**If the disinformation bill is not the way forward, what is ?**

Let us consider publications in the pre-internet era. If a newspaper reporter thought
she had a hot story, she would take it to the editorial meeting where she would have
to make the case that her sources are sound and believable based on evidence
produced and that the story is not defamatory or likely to incite riot or insurrection. If
the editor needs further assurance of the story’s fitness for publication it goes to the
legal division who make a determination. Thus by the time an article appears in a
reputable newspaper it has been tested in several ways as to fitness for publication.


-----

Now in the internet and social media era I can publish on Facebook or other platform
that my mate Johnny Smith ran in one day from Lukla to Everest base camp then up
Mount Everest and back again then all the way back to Lukla for an ice cream. Who
is responsible for this nonsense ? Facebook ? How could they be ? No, I am the
one responsible for what I publish. But there is very little restraint on what I publish
and nothing like the editorial oversight which is embedded in the tradition of
newspapers.

So my proposition is that the person or entity publishing material is the one
responsible for the content of it. How then can the person or entity be held to
account ?

By requiring all publications to be authorised by a specific individual person who
must prove their identity before being able to post on social media.

I propose that the person be required to prove photo identity at the same level as is
required for a driver’s license or a passport. This will make it difficult for a person to
hide behind a pseudonym.

Yes, I know some people will try to find a way around the regulation. Whenever there
is a law or regulation someone will expend great effort to subvert it. But most people
will have to publicly reveal their true identity in order to be able to publish material on
a digital platform service. If there is a complaint then the complainant or relevant
authority will know where to look for further clarification.

If the person claims to be representing an organisation or other group they must
prove that.

I propose that this regulation run as a trial for 5 years with ongoing evaluation.

Of course the Australian Government can only require Australian residents and
citizens to abide by this regulation. However other countries might implement the
same policy.

This regulation will not make the problems currently burdening digital information
platforms magically disappear but it could go a long way towards holding authors of
publications responsible for their contributions.
