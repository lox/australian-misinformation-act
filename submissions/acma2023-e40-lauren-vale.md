# y as a multiple generation Aussie my response is a flat NO to this proposal why? because so far the govt and experts etc so called best/honest information on a VAST array of subjects has been parlous, ill informed or outright trash!

 Covids just the best recent example but climate change is another gem. Maybe you should start Educating kids and not just telling them whats right and what they are to think? Scaring the hell out of them over climate hysteria thats patently UNtrue, from kindy onwards, would be a great start. Just about everything that I was told at school as fact has turned out to be not only wrong but outright lies. correction Basic Maths and English were pretty sound, the rest nope.

 Maybe however it would MAKE GOVT ministers and the rest liable for their UNtruths? Id like to live to see that day but I doubt I will.

 Without the ability to see a wide range of views and information on ANY topic no one CAN make a free OR informed decision on anything. ONLY the options to read/view/hear a huge range of options pro and cons and consider them allows that.

 We dont have to like or agree BUT the ability to have access is more important. hmm lets see? russiagate/iraq war/wmd/ pwc/children overboard..etc etc etc ringing any bells???

 yours Laurel Vale
