**Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 Submission          August 20, 2023**

The Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 is a danger and risk to men and women
and public citizens as there have been instances in the past; such as with cigarettes, asbestos,
thalidomide and DDT; where these were marketed as; and thought to be safe, however they were
proved later not to be safe. In the case of such an occurrence in the future where something like
cigarettes and the previous examples are marketed in the future as safe, or thought to be safe and
they are later found not to be safe, if this later discovered safety information highlighting potential
adverse safety can be supressed using the Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023,
the men and women and public citizens of Australia are in danger from the inability for accurate
information to be available and accessible.

Please alter, amend or repeal the Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2021 to
include this submission and my concerns, and ensure that the Bill does not pose a risk and danger to
men and women and public citizens of Australia.

Kind Regards,
Anthelme Collardeau
