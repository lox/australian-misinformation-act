Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Dear Senator Brown,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed “misinformation” law.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

The proposed bill will interfere with people’s ability to receive and impart information through social media. It is a
violation of Australians’ human rights and must be entirely rejected.

It is not the role of the government to tell people what they can and cannot say or think. It is all too easy to see how
unelected bureaucrats will be able to abuse these sweeping powers, once those powers are granted to them.

I give you an illustration what was happening during the Covid 19 pandemic.
Dr. Li Wenliang was widely regarded in China as a heroic truth-teller in the in early 2020, in the Chinese city of
Wuhan. He had been punished by the authorities for trying to warn others about the virus, and then, in a terrible turn,
had become severely sickened by it. Weeks later, he would become China’s most famous fatality of the emerging
pandemic.
Taken together showed how Dr. Li spent his last 39 days going up against a deadly virus — and navigating
government attempts to censor him. He was died at age 34.

Dr. Li remains a galvanizing figure, a symbol of frustration with the government’s suppression of independent voices
in China for freedom of speech.
In the earlier interview with Tucker at Fox as March 18, 2020 Dr Li MengYan, an virologist she said to Tucker the
proof -the coronavirus came from a Wuhan Lab. She said even further during the interview with Wion September 22,
2020 “ Covid 19 is not an accident, it is a cover-up”

Australia is from my view a great country whereby we can express the freedom of speech and you are chosen by the
people and you are my representative.

Below is a copy of my recent submission to the inquiry and, as one of my federal political representatives, please tell
me where you stand on this issue.

Please reject this bill.
