The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023, if enacted, will be the most draconian legislated since Federation in
peacetime conditions, and will see the rapid demise of a democratic Australia.

The Albanese Government have no electoral mandate for this legislation; indeed, it never formed
any part of the public ALP election campaign.

Over the last 3 years we have all seen how our populace has been manipulated into believing
government “disinformation”. In relation to COVID our government and bureaucrats were totally
**wrong on all of the following;**

   - Transmission of disease

   - Asymptomatic spread of disease

   - PCR test efficacy

   - Covid case numbers

   - Covid fatality rates

   - Mask wearing

   - Sanitisers

   - Lockdown efficacy

   - Quarantining the healthy

   - Hospital overloads

   - Impact on youth

   - Impact on elderly

   - Social distancing/outdoor spread

   - Natural immunity

   - Suppression of early treatment protocols and safe drugs proven to work

   - Plexiglass barriers

   - Covid “vaccine” safety and effectiveness

   - Covid “vaccine” staying “at the site of injection”

   - Covid “vaccine” injuries

   - Covid “vaccine” deaths

This legislation gives unelected bureaucrats the power to define “misinformation” and
“disinformation” and consequently what is “the truth.” These are pages torn right out George
Orwell’s 1984 with the “Ministry of Truth”.
As you can see from the examples above the Government has an abysmal track record of getting it
right and censoring the truth. This is no surprise as since the beginning of the entire Covid fiasco, all
governments in Australia are following, in lockstep, overseas dictates. It seems that Australia has
already lost its sovereignty to international institutions and largely privately funded organisations
headed by war criminals such as the World Health Organisation. If I didn’t know any better, there is
now a One World Government dictating policy to the West. With that, of course, comes
inducements. Does this government seriously believe the people don’t know where the funds came
from to service this biggest wealth transfer in human history? So, now comes the payback. Australia,
like the other obsequious countries in the West is also ushering in similar draconian measures to
silence and control the people. This legislation appears to be following the same path as that
recently passed in Eire and is in process in the UK, Canada, US and Europe.

This dystopian legislation also covers “misinformation” in relation to the Environment, presumably
to stifle any questioning regarding the “science” of anthropogenic climate change. Is this to prevent
the truth about so called anthropogenic climate change, which is merely a means to propagate a

control state complete with social credit scores, with yet another massive wealth transfer from
people to the Elites.

Australia’s politicians claim that we are still a democracy. If that is true, then people must be allowed
to hear all opinions and then make up their own minds. Given Australia’s total annual education cost
exceeds well over $50 Billion, Australians should have the cognitive ability to work out what is and
isn’t disinformation without bureaucratic interference and propaganda.

Most interesting and hypocritical is that this proposed legislation will not apply to Government
institutions!! So, the Government can lie to the populace without any retribution? It’s not
“misinformation” if it comes from the Government? Just look at the dot points above in relation to
Covid where government policy was absolutely wrong which has led to:

  - Increasing debt – now approaching $1 trillion

  - 13.5% excess death rate

  - Collapsed manufacturing industry

  - Small business failures

  - Skyrocketing mental health

  - Health sector employee shortages

  - Public loss of trust in the health system

In conclusion, the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 must NOT be enacted.
