# Submission Regarding the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

I am proud to be an Australian citizen because our nation has always supported our
freedoms of speech and expression, whether all agree with everything expressed or
not. Disagreeing or stating ones sincere beliefs, should not be labelled as hate
speech, when delivered respectfully, just because it doesn't line up with someone
else s way of thinking. After all, who should have the right to judge what truth is? All
Australians should be able to state the truth as they see it and dobate/discuss issues
without being judged or condemned.

I am not in support of this new Bill proposal which puts our government in a position
#### of ultimate authority on what we can say and believe. To make ACMA and META,
the tech watchdogs with authority to punish and impose huge fines on those who
donâ€™t fall into line with their interpretation of what truth is; is unconstitutional. We
should protect our traditional human rights and freedoms, as our Australian
government has always done to date These included: freedom of speech; opinion;
religion; association and movement,

1 strongly oppose this proposed Bill and believe the impacts of trying to enforce an
ideological conformity would be devastating for our country. The possibility of misuse
#### of censorship powers and insufficient accountability, (for those dictating truth, and
policing it), also poses a terrible threat to the safety and well-being of Australians.

This Bill is not consistent with the United Nations declaration of human rights, and
would bo a drastic overreach on behalf of our Australian government. Thank you for
the opportunity to express my opposition to this misinformation and disinformation
Bill.

Kind Regards,
