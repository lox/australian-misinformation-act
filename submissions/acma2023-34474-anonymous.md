# I say NO to this bill.
We are a democratic society with the constitutional right to freedom of speech. In our democratic
society we have the freedom to express ourselves, be it disagree or agree. Look at our beautiful
multicultural country with everybody having the freedom to speak their truth, express their likes
concerns or whatever they want.

It is our fundamental right and the importance of a democratic society to have free speech, free
opinion and free discourse. Which leads to everybody participating “, which leads to a thriving
democracy. I ask you, “’ how can one person’s opinion be more or less important than any other
person?’’ especially in our DEMOCRATIC society.

This bill should NOT get passed as it will censor and oppress free Australians right to their own
opinion and their right to gather all information to create their own opinion. who would be given this
right to dictate what they believe to be right or wrong, disinformation or misinformation.
Information is just information, and I’m sure every Australian is intelligent enough to decide this for
themselves not have someone decide this for them. If u take away free speech, we are not a
democratic society and u have taken away our constitutional rights.
