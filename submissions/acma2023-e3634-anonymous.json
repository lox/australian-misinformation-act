      "There is a risk that the bill could be used to suppress dissenting opinions, particularly around elections and referendums.",
      "The legislation could drive misinformation underground, making it harder to address and correct.",
      "The bill could lead to censorship and a reduction in the free availability of information, which is detrimental to democracy."

      "'There are also dangers inherent in allowing any one body - be it government, a government taskforce, or a social media platform - to become the sole arbiter of ‘truth’.",
      "'Suppressing open and free inquiry is what we need to be most afraid of, not ‘tin­ foil hat wearers’.",
      "'The Australian public can also play an important role in countering foreign interference through social media. Increasing digital literacy throughout the general community would help to ensure that the Australian population are better able to recognise and respond appropriately to the risks of misinformation and disinformation online, which would increase national resilience in respect of these risks.'"
