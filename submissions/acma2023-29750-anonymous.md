Dear members of the Authority,

The claim has been made that, “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the
safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”

The past three and a half years have shown us that it is, in fact, not misinformation and
disinformation per se but rather the censorship of thoughts, ideas, observations and
discoveries that is actually to be of concern in Australia in 2023 and in the coming years.
It is biased, unproven, financially profitable and internationally driven propaganda that, in
truth, poses a threat to the “safety and well-being of Australians, as well as to our
democracy, society and economy”.

With the proposal of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, Australian citizens are being treated as
though we are incapable of deep, independent, critical thought. This is insulting and very
concerning. No person, organisation or government department, however well-intentioned
it may be, has a monopoly on truth nor should they be given unrestrained agency to
suppress and censor the sharing of knowledge and ideas. Freedom of thought and the
freedom to peacefully deliver one’s thoughts and opinions in the public sphere are essential
facets of life within a truly democratic nation. It is the very sharing of ideas and opinions
that allows us to continually learn and grow as individuals and as a society.

So I ask, in relation to the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, who will really be
given the power to determine what is fact and what is fiction? Who will really decide what
is truth and what is dis/misinformation? Will it be the partisan government of the day? Or
will it be big corporations who seek to suppress the truth? Will it be international bodies
that wish to dictate to our nation’s leaders what is acceptable and not acceptable? What
have we come to in this country if this the level to which our supposed leaders will stoop in
order to control the minds and lives of Australians? It will be a grave and sad situation in
this country if the proposed “Disinformation Bill” passes into Australian law.

As someone once wisely said, “Beware those who are quick to censor. They are afraid of
what they do not know.” It is this that I will continue to teach my children daily, for only in
learning to think, analyse and reason for ourselves will we ever really be able to protect our
safety, wellbeing and democracy.

Please reconsider enacting this unnecessary bill. Allow Australians to reason and think for
ourselves.
Sincerely,


-----
