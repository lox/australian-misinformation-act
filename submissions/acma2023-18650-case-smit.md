# As a Scientist, I know that a scientific issue cannot be settled by consensus or government decree. It normally requires debate and the demonstration of hard evidence (empirical data) to establish the correctness of an hypothesis. Such debates, sometimes heated, often involve minority opinions which eventually turn out to be correct. There are innumerable examples of this in the history of Science. 

 It would be contrary to scientific progress if debate were to be stifled by the proposed legislation.

 Facts which contradict current Government policies could be regarded as being mis(or dis)information. For instance, it is an irrefutable fact that there is no empirical proof that carbon dioxide causes climate change or that Covid vaccination prevents transmission of the virus, but stating such facts could be construed under the proposed legislation as being harmful.

 Therefore, this bill should not be passed by Parliament.
