The problem with a government run disinformation or misinformation system is of course the
question of who defines mis/dis-information. Given that the greatest source of misinformation
over the last few years has been politicians and government bureaucrats, then there has to be a
better way to manage this.

I say the government, and those advising it, should be the last to define and run a
disinformation system.

Let the public decide through open discussion on social media, etc.
