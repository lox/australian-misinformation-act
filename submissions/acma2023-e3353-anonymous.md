Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Thank you for the opportunity to speak about my concerns with the 'Misinformation Bill'.
## I would like to tell you about the Antiques Roadshow Holocaust Memorial Moment Fiona Bruce reveals her shock at
`chilling' racist board game from Nazi Germany during Holocaust edition of Antiques Roadshow
Episode aired Jan 15, 2017 and the following as printed in the 'Sun'. by Mark Hodge

What was so concerning was the systematic, intentional, accepted and even marketed, all legally this atrocious game

Presenter Fiona Bruce'IT'S TEACHING CHILDREN TO HATE'
'Long-time presenter Bruce was clearly shocked at the game, titled 'Jews Out', calling it the "most chilling" exhibit she
had seen.
The board game dates back to 1938 when Adolf Hitler's Nazi party ruled Germany indoctrinating its people with a
twisted white supremacist ideology.
While speaking to a historian, Bruce said: "Of all the things I've seen today this is the most chilling'.

Have you ever heard of the analogy when a frog is cooked but doesn't realize it? The water temperature is heated up
so slowly so that it doesn't suddenly disturb the frog and awaken it to the danger of the hosts intention, he doesn't
fight or flight. Then its too late. We are already seeing an acceptance to indifference and the targeting of people of
faiths and of free speech. But all the while this was going on In Nazi Germany there was a slow acceptance by people
that this was acceptable and the laws became jusque datum sceleri' lest we become'nec hospes ab hospite tutus'
which I think is from 'Commonplace book of Sir Edward Dering [manuscript]'
The game rounds up Jews then the Policeman locks them up. This game was marketed to children and was very
popular. The media was controlled and the vast masses accepted it!
Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because
## it's easy to see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Meta said that the law would have a "chilling"
effect on free speech. It would be easy for a government to label as "misinformation" anything that could hurt its
reputation (as many authoritarian governments already do). Giving the government such unrestricted power is
terrifying. This might seem sensationalism or irrelevant or over the top but what was most concerning was our Prime
Minister when asked what he would do if he was a Dictator for three days?* (Sky News Neil Mitchell asks why 14
August 2023) He said he would close down and ban social media!

## I have been an elected official and even then I would never think of banning social media or other forms of
communication even though I was going though significant hardship myself and resigned. I believe in free speech that
much! If you tamper with this then we risk loosing everything dear to us which I really cant express my concern
enough, it lies at the heart of our democracy as penned by the Victorian Bar ** (Lawyers Weekly 31 July 2023 as
reported by Lauren Croft, full excerpt below)
"The Victorian Bar noted that the bill has the potential to interfere with freedom of expression in Australia, as well as
negatively impact freedom of speech, which the Victorian Bar said was "the lifeblood of democracy.

Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false.
We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this
vital process.

## It's easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found
inconvenient. The proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it's allowed to be passed.

Please reject this proposed law.

**Victorian Bar president Sam Hay KC told members it was "a particularly important" submission for the body.
"In our submission, we state that, while we acknowledge the potential harm posed by the rapid and widespread
dissemination of false or otherwise harmful information online, we have significant concerns about the bill's response
to that danger. In our view, the bill is insufficiently sensitive to, and protective of, freedom of expression and related
privacy interests," he said in a statement.
"I would like to thank Gina Schoff KC, Mark Robins KC and Romauld Andrew KC for their help in pulling it together,
and special thanks and acknowledgement go to James McComish and Dr Julian Murphy for their sterling
contributions to the document."
The Victorian Bar noted that the bill has the potential to interfere with freedom of expression in Australia, as well as
negatively impact freedom of speech, which the Victorian Bar said was "the lifeblood of democracy".

Thank you for taking the time to read my submission
