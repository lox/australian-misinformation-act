**Submission on**
**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and        .**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023 .**

I am a retired engineer living in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales.

When I heard of this amendment, I felt I had to make a submission, simply because I had
not seen such an unacceptable piece of legislation which has the potential to strike at the heart of
the fundamental values of democracy in a free Australia.

I am absolutely opposed to this Bill.

It would allow any future government to define what is or is not misinformation or
disinformation, depending on their own political or social agenda. This could be a totally subjective
judgement which could be used to restrict or influence public debate in any form of media or even
public speech.

This Bill fails to respect the sanctity of free expression and associated rights to privacy
and has the potential for misuse and to be completely undemocratic.

This Bill would allow governments to act against it's critics, simply by declaring their
statements as “untrue” with no recourse, which is totally unacceptable.

I have never sided with Liberal Party before but I absolutely endorse their call and that of
the Victorian Bar Association, and many others, to throw this Bill out.

Yours sincerely.
Denis Rothwell
