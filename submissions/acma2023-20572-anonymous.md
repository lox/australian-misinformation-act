# Submission – Legislafion regarding misinformafion and disinformafion on social media plafforms. 

## I am wrifing this submission to express my absolute objecfion to the proposed legislafion regarding Misinformafion and Disinformafion across all social media sites across Australia. I note that giving ACMA, a group of non elected persons, the power to decide exactly what is and is not misinformafion or disinformafion from the general public ufterly unacceptable.  In addifion, I note that the Government has exempted itself from this legislafion, opening the way for them to impart any informafion or advice, with no requirement of that informafion or advice to be check for accuracy. 
 This legislafion gives the Government or their appointed bureaucrats in ACMA the authority to decide what the peoples thoughts and opinions should be and to impose penalfies for them expressing these. It essenfially takes away everyday Australians basic human rights of freedom of speech. 
 As stated above, ADMA are non elected bureaucrats. Who are they to decide what is misinformafion or disinformafion? Who is anyone to decide this for someone else? In a democrafic society, freedom of speech, expression and opinions are basic rights. Interesfingly enough, the Government would like this legislafion to be in place before the Australian public vote on The Voice – a topic that the Government have promoted with giving incenfives to push the Yes vote to the tune of $15 million.  Since when were referendums dealt with the same way as elecfions?
 If this legislafion goes ahead, it will be the end of Australia as we know it. It will be akin to the Communist Government in China. Democracy will be dead.
