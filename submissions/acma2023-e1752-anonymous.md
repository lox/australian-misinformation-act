I am deeply concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation Bill’. We all know the internet can be used to promote
all kinds of information, some of which is untrue. But the answer is not to make the government the arbiter of truth and to censor
those it disagrees with. The solution is open and honest debate. The exposure of bad ideas with an open critique of those bad
ideas is the only way the truth can prevail.

Australia has always had a strong stance on human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and conscience. Our nation
had it right all along. The proposed bill will not progress Australia but regress it.

This bill represents complete government overreach. More than that, it is a path to authoritarianism. Some governments today
willingly control what is allowed and not allowed to be said. When loyalty to the government and its version of truth is the
supreme virtue, we cross the threshold into totalitarianism. That is not the Australia we want to pass on to the next generation.

I strongly reject this proposal.

I strongly reject this proposal as it will overrule free speech and the necessity of open and honest debate inherent in our freedom
of democracy and what our beautiful Australia has been built upon. Debate allows opportunity of ‘both sides to be heard’ to
where the issue can be worked through for the good of all Australian citizens rather than being left to a select few who indeed
may be inappropriately biased where truth and justice needs to be sought after for the betterment of Australia’s future and its
generations to follow.
