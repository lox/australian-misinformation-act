      "The legislation represents an increase in government censorship and control over dissenting voices.",
      "The bill is likened to a 'Ministry of Truth', suggesting Orwellian overtones and a move towards a communist-style governance.",
      "The proposed powers for ACMA to determine truth are seen as an insult to public intelligence and a threat to scientific debate.",
      "The submission argues that during the pandemic, many government-approved narratives were later proven false, and dissenting voices were unjustly silenced.",
      "The bill is perceived as a threat to freedom of speech and a mechanism to prevent holding the government accountable.",
      "The submission suggests that the mainstream media and government were the primary sources of misinformation during the pandemic.",
      "The bill is viewed as a step towards a totalitarian state, limiting public discourse on important issues like 'The Voice', Net Zero policies, and digital currency."

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "To introduce this ‘Ministry of Truth’ via the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) also indicates a cynical side and shows the direction planned for Australia.",
      "To say that a government agency (ACMA) will be afforded the power to become the absolute arbiter of truth, is an insult to the intelligence of everyday Australians.",
      "This Bill amounts to nothing more than censorship by coercion (threat of huge fines), more akin to the actions of the Communist Regimes of China and North Korea.",
      "I firmly believe this to be a very dangerous Bill which presents the most serious threat to not only the freedom of every Australian, but also to our way of life."
