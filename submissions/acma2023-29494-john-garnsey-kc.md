**SUBMISSION OF JOHN GARNSEY KC ON THE**

**EXPOSURE DRAFT BILL FOR THE**

**COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMBATTING MISINFORMATION AND**

**DISINFORMATION) ACT 2023**

**Sunday 6 August 2023**

**Generally:**

1. The proposed legisla0on in its substance and in its dra6ing is inconsistant with
freedom of speech and opinion and a dangerous threat to the rights of Australian
ci0zens and others freely to hold and express opinions, ideas and views on any
subject not otherwise in contraven0on of exis0ng specific laws.

2. The undefined and undefinable boundaries of the so-called defini0ons in sec0on 7
and sec0on 3 of the Exposure Dra6 are incapable of meaningful analysis and do not
and cannot form a basis for the aHempted imposi0on of the severe restric0ons on
freedom of speech and opinion in the Exposure Dra6.

3. The proposed legisla0on should be wholly abandoned.

4. The proposed legisla0on in its substance and intent is also inconsistent with the
implied right to poli0cal communica0on held by the High Court to exist in the
Australian Cons0tu0on.  See inter alia Na*onwide News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177
CLR 1; _Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106;_ _David_
_Lange v Australian Broadcas*ng Corpora*on (ABC) (1997) 189 CLR 520; McLoy v New_
_South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 17._

5. The provisions dealing with Misinforma0on Codes and Standards are a tempta0on
and incitement to governmental and bureaurocra0c control of free speech and
opinion and represent a further dangerous threat to the rights of Australian ci0zens
and others freely to hold and express opinions, ideas and views factual or otherwise.

**The definiMons:**

6. Considered separately and cumula0vely, the elements of the cri0cal defini0ons of
"disinforma0on" and "misinforma0on" in sec0on 7 of the Exposure Dra6 are illdefined, ambiguous, imprecise, lacking boundaries, impose an impossible task on a
decision maker, and invite and enable a decision maker to apply his or her own views,
prejudices and agendas:

    - the term "content" does not dis0nguish between "informa0on" which is fact and
informa0on which is opinion but extends to opinions which may be bona fide
held even if incorrect as an opinion (as in defences of comment in defama0on
law so long as there is a connec0on with appropriate facts),


-----

- the term "content" obliges the decision maker to determine whether "the
content" is "false, misleading or decep0ve" in an unspecified and undefined
manner or respect (is this to "the public"or "end users" whoever they may be see sec0on 3 of the Exposure Dra6),

- the decision maker is then obliged to determine whether the provision of the
content is "reasonably likely" to "cause or contribute" serious harm (whatever
that is) or the person dissemina0ng it intended to deceive :another person"
whoever that is.,

- in subsec0on 7(3) paragraphs (a) to (i) the decision maker is "assisted" to
determine whether the provision of the content is "reasonably likely" to "cause
or contribute" (to some undefined extent) serious harm (whatever that is) by
having regard to a wide range of maHers including "anything at all" considered
relevant,

- the essen0ally undefined task of the decision maker is further compounded by
the "defini0on"of "harm" in secion 3 of the Exposure Dra6 which "defines" harm
as "meaning" any of the following:


(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity,


nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or
mental disability;


(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;


(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of


Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions;


(d) harm to the health of Australians;
(e) harm to the Australian environment;
(f) economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a


sector of the Australian economy.



- These underlined categories are so wide as to be meaningless as a definition
of any relevant and particular "harm" attracting liability.


**The misconceptions of the drafter**


7. Proposed legislation which modifies or detracts from existing freedoms or rights
should be expressed in clear and precisely defined terms and limited to an extent
strictly necessary.  The use of amiguous, imprecise terms or ill-defined language or
concepts should be avoided.  The late Professor Julius Stone identified and deplored
what he called "categories of indeterminate reference" in legal language,especially in
statutes. The definitions in the Exposure Draft specialise in indeterminacy and the
absence of boundaries, to make the task of the decisionmaker and enforcer
easier.signature


-----

8. It is evident from the elementary analysis of the so-called definitions in section 7
and section 3 of the Exposure Draft above that the terms, concepts and categories
used in the drafting impose an impossible burden on a decision maker in a
government department and indeed they would impose a heavy if not impossible
burden on a judge in a fully resourced court case.

**The other provisions of the Exposure Draft**

9. The other provisions of the Exposure Draft should fall with the definitions.  The
provisions dealing with Misinformation Codes and Standards are an incitement to
governmental and bureaurocratic control of free speech and opinion and reinforce
what is a dangerous threat to the rights of Australian citizens and others freely to
hold and express opinions, ideas and views factual or otherwise.


10. The proposed legislation should be wholly abandoned.
