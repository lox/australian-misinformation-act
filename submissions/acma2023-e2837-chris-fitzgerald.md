##### I am against censorship of opinions because

We see our debating floors of Parliament constantly misused.
##### A Member asks a legitimate question of Government, representing their electorate
The question does not get answered
##### It is taken on notice and never responded to.
Government wastes time, ridicules the Member, goes off topic and fails to answer.
Withholding the truth is as good as lying.

History show Nazis burning books where those books did not agree with their narrative
Truth, no matter how unpalatable, is truth!
You don't solve problems by using mistruths to make decisions.

In November 2021 Australia began allowing the fully vaccinated into Australia.
Up to November 2021, Australia had about 1700 Covid deaths.
Since then, official statistics showed Australia's death rate soared into the tnousands.

European Parliament questioed a Pfizer representative.
She admitted to EU Parliament, Pfizer DID NOT test that their vaccine would stop transmission

Yet our Government still tells us to get boosted to protect ourselves and those around us.
Fact is, the official narrative has intentionally or unintentionally been misleading and cost thousands of lives
Meanwhile, many accurate and qualified opinions were wrongly suppressed.

Pfizer's own documents were initially sealed for 70 years.
##### A U.S. Freedom of information request by concerned doctors saw the Pfizer documents released.
Those documents showed abour 1400 deaths in the U.S. in the first 10 weeks from Pfizers vaccine!

The TGAs Database of Adverse Event Notifications for Astrazenica, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines shows
masses of serious side affects, including death, yet the public is being told otherwise.
The TGA has recently released a warning about Curcumin and Turmeric over just ONE death and about 10
reported serious complications. The Covid vaccines are officially shown to be far more dangerous, yet
Australians were forced out of jobs and maligned for refusing Covid vaccines.

About 10 months ago, Dr Kerryn Phelps stated she and her partner had serious side effects from the
vaccines -also, that Doctors were being prevented from sharing what they had witnessed from the vaccines

Front line Health Workers were also being prevented from talking about what they witnessed.
I saw one interview where an Adelaide Nurse stated they had 38 people in ICU -33 of them were fully
vaccinated. At that time, South Australia had closed borders and virtually no Covid!
##### Very strongly implicated, were the vaccines!

Suppressing the truth is as good as lying.
##### If we dont listen to ALL opinions, we will miss solutions and the "mistakes" made will be covered up to save
face, hide corrupt behaviour or deliberately mislead Australians into wrong, even deadly decisions.

Goverment has shown they dont deal in facts or truth very well.
They cannot be trusted to decide what is truth and what is not.

We have rules about misleading Parliament.
That is because experience shows Politicians may be compromised and cover up dishonesty

e.g. Gladys Berejiklian

Yet they want to be the ones to censor facts -they simply cannot always be trusted.

In the 1930s, Walter Froggett was the one lone voice speaking against the release of cane toads in
##### Australia. Al l the know it all "experts"opposed him. Look at the problem we have today -he was right and was ignored - the consequences are too high!

I am against people and politicians who refuse to hear others' points of view.

##### We constantly see just a hand full of Senators speaking to an almost empty Senate Chamber -Government and others choosing not to even listen to information that has proved true.

I am against silencing what may well turn out to be truth.

##### Censorship is a very dangerous power in the wrong hands. AUSTRALIANS CANNOT AFFORD THAT RISK!

 Thank You
