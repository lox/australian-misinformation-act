I believe that this proposed law and new powers of the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) are a direct violation of Australia's democracy and freedom of speech laws.
Implementing this law resembles the actions of a communist government, rather than upholding the
democratic principles on which Australia was founded.

Granting the government the authority to fine organisations, social media platforms, or individuals
for sharing information deemed false or inaccurate sets our country on a dangerous path towards
totalitarianism. It undermines an individual's right to think freely, make independent decisions, and
express themselves openly.

If the Australian government truly values the opinions of its citizens on the implementation of this
law, it should conduct a widespread media campaign to properly communicate the details and
consequences of this legislation. Then, it should ask the Australian people whether they agree to
such draconian measures. I certainly believe that 95% of Australians would strongly oppose the
implementation of this legislation.

If the government wishes to fine organisations, social media platforms, or individuals for sharing
information online that does not align with its political or financial agenda, it is essentially dictating
how Australians should live their lives, undermining their freedom of thought, speech, and the
empowerment to conduct their own research and make informed decisions. This proposed
legislation is a blatant affront to Australia's democracy and the freedom of its citizens.

I strongly vote NO to the implementation of this legislation and seriously question the motivations of
this Albanese government.
