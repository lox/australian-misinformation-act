Unfortunately we live in a country right now where Australians are afraid to speak freely. Afraid of
having an open dialog or debate, afraid of losing their jobs, or being cancelled or accused of a crime
for something that wasn’t considered a crime a few years ago. Criminalising free speech, no matter
how horrible that speech might be, is wrong. Free speech must be protected by our democracy.
Without free speech we are no longer a democracy but a country that lives under a tyranny.

Having a government trying to control what we are allowed to see or say under the guise of protecting
us from the so-called misinformation or disinformation is not democratic. A government that
appoints itself (or a designated third party) as the sole authority and voice of truth of information is
not new, it has been practised in many countries over history under communism, fascism and
totalitarian regimes.

We don’t need to be protected by our government, we are not stupid, we are adults capable of making
decisions about what is best for us and to discern what we consider right or wrong.

NO, we don’t need a Ministry of Truth, NO, we don’t want unelected bureaucrats to control,
manipulate or manage in any form the information Australians have the right to access.
