I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed legislation to combat misinformation
and disinformation, which I believe poses a significant threat to the democratic principles that our great
nation upholds.

I believe that every person in society should have the right to express their thoughts and feelings
without fear of being demonized, reprimanded or sanctioned.

The lack of clarity regarding what constitutes “disinformation” and “misinformation and who decides
what information is disinformation” leaves room for subjective interpretations allowing the Government
to selectively target and suppress dissenting voices or viewpoints that it deems inconvenient or
unfavorable .

Every person should have the right to independently evaluate information and make their own
informed decisions, whether it is in line with the Governments views and policies or not.

As a representative of the people, I ask you to carefully evaluate the potential consequences of the
disinformation Misinformation Bill on our democracy.

I kindly request that you consider my concerns and use your influence to advocate for a comprehensive
evidence-based approach to addressing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation, one that
protects democracy while ensuring the preservation of our civil liberties.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust in your commitment to upholding the values that
define our great nation

Yours Sincerely,


-----
