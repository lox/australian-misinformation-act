This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective.
What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It is
simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This proposed bill
is an extreme version of this. Many fine young Autralian Anzacs gave their very lives to ensure freedoms for future generations of
Australians, which include freedom to think and speak without being manipulated or controlled by government and /or those in
authority, and to have the inalienable right to agree to disagree.This bill is a betrayal of all that these brave heroes of the past died
fighting for. Any government that chooses to ignore and disregard the values, sacrifices, and history of the previous founding
generations of our country will not get voted in again. The reason so many from other countries around the world who are under
this kind government overreach and domination want to come to Australia,is because of, the freedom to think and speak about
what they believe,without fear of reprisals, that they enjoy here. This bill will turn Autralia into a dictatorship that not only no one
will want to be part of, but also, will cause many Australians to no longer call Australia home!!

It must be completely rejected and thrown out!!!�
