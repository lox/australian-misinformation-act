Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

The “Misinformation Bill” must be rejected.

Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a free and fair society. It is a fundamental value of Australia. Despite denials to
the contrary, the proposed bill will erode this fundamental human right.

Freedom of speech is essential in attempting to discover truth. The whole process of discovery relies on free-flowing
information that can be tested and questioned. There are many instances when society or the government of the day
has held to a position or scientific idea, only to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this
essential dialogue.

Setting up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer as the government is made up of people whose
ideas of truth are subjective to their worldview.

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.
