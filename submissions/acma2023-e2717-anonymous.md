Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

### I have lived all my life (70 plus years) in Australia, a country I love. And I want it to continue to be a country I love, and
to be a safe and wonderful country for my children and grandchildren to live in. However, many pieces of legislation,
both at state and federal level in recent years, are radically changing my Australia for the worse. The latest piece of
proposed legislation is this "Misinformation Bill".

### I strongly reject this proposed legislation. The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from "harm".
But the government will cause harm by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the
rights of the individual, not suppressing them.

The central issue is: Who decides what is fact? The proposed bill's answer is: The government in collaboration with
big tech. Regardless of what a person believes about religion, marriage, the definition of a woman, or the Voice
referendum, if the misinformation bill is passed, the human right of freedom of speech will be violated, disagreement
with the government punished and our democratic system severely degraded.

We will be well on our way to a totalitarian dictatorship where the government can "just assert things as facts".

The recent history of the government attempting to define what is "misinformation" should cause grave concerns
about this bill. During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from
getting and spreading the virus. Those who questioned and critiqued this were censored on social media.

### I had my vaccinations (you could not go anywhere unless you did!) and yet I still caught Covid-19 after having had my
vaccinations. Nearly every Australian was vaccinated for Covid-19, yet the virus kept spreading until almost every
Australian caught it! So it soon became obvious to everyone the government was wrong, and the "misinformation"
was right! The rationale for censorship on this issue might have been well-intentioned, but time proved the
censor-happy bureaucrats wrong. This is one example only, which shows why giving the government even more
power to define what is TRUTH is a recipe for disaster.

This bill must be rejected.
