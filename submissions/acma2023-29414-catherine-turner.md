Australia needs to remain a free country for the people

I understand that the Australian Government, elected by the people for the people, is
intending to tell those very people what they should see, read and hear. Given we
are able to make up our own minds as to which party should be "in charge" we
should also be trusted to work out what is misinformation or disinformation. We most
certainly do not need "fact checkers", whoever they are, to make those decisions for
us.

Australia is still a constitutional federation of states and not a socialist dictatorship.
The people have the right to hear all the arguments – the good ones and the bad
ones – and decide for themselves what’s true and what’s false.

Politicians and unelected bureaucrats have no place interfering in that process. They
are paid to make decisions in the interest of the people who pay their salaries.

Australia is successful and prosperous because we’ve been able to freely campaign
and argue for what we believe.

There is no place for any laws that attempt to stop Australians being fully informed
before they are asked to vote in an election or at referenda. Social media is the
"modern town square" where all views, both good and bad, should be allowed to be
heard. A government that seeks to silence decent is a communist government.

Politicians who try to play the arbiters of truth put our democracy in jeopardy and
destroy the confidence the people have in their elected officials.

That’s why you must reject these so-called ‘misinformation’ laws that will only limit
the ability of Australians to make up their own minds.

Couch this in any terms you wish, but this proposed Bill is to establish a 'Ministry of
Truth', no different to the days of Hitler and Stalin except it is across a much broader
spectrum of communication means.

I’m asking that a NO to this authoritarian attack on our freedom. I’m joining forces
with many other voters like me to reject Labor, the Greens and the Teals’ ‘Ministry of
Truth’. Telling me that it was 'the Liberals idea' makes no difference. It needs to be
stopped immediately.

My father fought in a war to maintain our rights and freedoms. I will not let his
sacrifices be null and void by politicians that have no rights to silence the people.
