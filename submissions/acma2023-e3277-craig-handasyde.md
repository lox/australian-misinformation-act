To whom it may concern,

As someone who values free speech and the fundamental democratic rights we enjoy in Australia, I am expressing my concerns
about the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill) proposed by the
Albanese Government.

I don't the need governments arbitration of truth. The best remedy for Misinformation is a society that has free and open debate,
allowing blatant lies to freely come forth.. They will always come to the surface and be exposed. Collective truth will also rise to
the surface as always.

Australia is a free country that allows people to freely ask questions, float ideas and challenge situations/ notions. This is a sign of
a mature nation where we can do this. We have brains that can rationalise many ideas without the need for big brother
government to step in and override with sensorship.

I should be able to freely and respectly express opinions that I have. And other people should be able to freely agree or if not
agree, simply take no notice. Simple. A lot of people say things that I disagree with. This is good for me to think about. It helps
me either confirm my beliefs or alter them. I don't need a government stepping in and arbitrating truth over the top of me and my
fellow citizens of this wonderfully free nation.

I oppose this bill and seek that it not be instated in any way shape or form.

Kind regards

Craig Handasyde
