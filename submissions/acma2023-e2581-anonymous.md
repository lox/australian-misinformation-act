Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian. This proposed “misinformation” law is an attack on our
basic human rights by a government that is supposed to uphold those rights, not stifle them.

Thus Bill only benefits Albanese and his politicians. There is not benefit to the citizens of Australia. Albanese and his
government want complete power and control over us all. We will not stand for this.

The government is attempting to place upon itself an impossible burden of objectivity. No government body has the
wisdom or ability to sort out what is true and what isn’t. We’ve never had so much information available at our
fingertips in all of human history. The amount of information that can be accessed online is incredibly vast. What
group of bureaucrats could possibly discern truth from falsehood on every subject?

The bill’s stated aim is to keep Australians from “harm”. Preventing harm is a good thing. The problem is that the
proposed law will ultimately do great harm itself. One example is the recent pandemic and the question of where
COVID-19 originated. The official line was that it came from nature and that the lab origin was “misinformation” that
could “harm” our relationship with China.

Now we have learned that the virus likely did come from the Wuhan lab. What was once called “misinformation” is
now quite possibly the truth! The question of COVID-19’s origin is vital so that we can avoid a repeat scenario.
Censoring truthful reporting about the lab leak theory will itself cause “harm” by preventing us from learning from our
mistakes.

With this one example, we can see how the proposed “misinformation” law will increase “harm” even as it seeks to
reduce it.

The bill is misguided and must be rejected.
