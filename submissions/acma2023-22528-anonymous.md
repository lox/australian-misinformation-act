I have deep concerns about this proposed new legislafion. My concern lies around the erosion of
freedom of speech and informafion.

The proposed legislafion begins with a statement that misinformafion and disinformafion is harmful.
I am firmly of the belief that informafion in and of itself is not harmful but is to be judged by the
individual as to its veracity or otherwise. This cannot be done in a milieu where only a government
approved and sancfioned version of informafion is allowed; it will certainly silence many viewpoints
that differ from the ideologies currently being championed by the government in close cohesion with
the media. Subjecfing media plafforms and the expressions of individuals to penalfies is a truly
objecfionable idea. There will literally no longer be any freedom of speech, ideas, communicafion or
ideology. This is already underway but so far has just resulted in people of unpopular opinions being
‘cancelled’ – a hard enough penalty to bear for those differing from a mainstream view. This will now
go a step further and weaponize the law to silence dissenfing voices.

Just like informafion in itself not being harmful; speech in itself cannot be harmful. Stafing in wrifing
a belief about a behaviour, for example, is not ‘hate’ but an opinion; one with which others are
welcome to differ. I feel there are huge and inherent dangers in the course of acfion being proposed
by this new legislafion. There will be enormous consequences for some parts of the community and
there will be only one dogma by which there is permission to live. There will be tremendous social
fallout and huge danger to many cifizens the bill ostensibly seeks to protect. Unpopular ideas could
be legally censored. Please give some credit to the ability of people to discern and decide for
themselves what is true and what is not and PLEASE reconsider this dangerous piece of legislafion.
