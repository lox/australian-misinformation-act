**‘No’ to Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Recall the time in Australian history when married women were banned from working in the
Australian public sector until the discriminatory law was overturned. Thalidomide was approved by
medical professionals but caused severe birth deformities worldwide before the drug was
withdrawn. Homosexuality was deemed a criminal act in our country and many others until the law
was reformed.

These are examples from the past, where government bureaucrats, academics and traditional media
outlets got it wrong – the same organisations which the Bill proposes to uphold as the keepers of the
truth in 2023 by banning all dissenting views.

Beware the unintended consequences of enacting a Bill which segregates our society into those who
have the correct, government-approved thoughts and those who do not.

The anonymous bureaucrats, academics and captains of industry who authored this Bill, have
intentionally misnamed it: it is a Bill to censor free speech, control the flow of information and
stamp down any debates by which Australians can voice their differences and agreements in how to
improve society.

This Bill talks of the Australian government incentivising co-operation and requiring digital platform
providers to keep records related to misinformation and disinformation. Plain and simple, this is the
coercion of commercial agencies and the outsourcing of records collection in order to criminalise
Australian citizens for expressing their opinions.

Here is what I would like my government to do to promote transparency and fairness in digital
platforms: Legislate for every online space using AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms to publish, in
Plain English, the functions and effects of the algorithms on information which is either provided or
captured.

I do not permit the Australian government to curate my information for me. Long live critical
thinking.
