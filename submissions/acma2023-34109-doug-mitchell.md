# Submission RE Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

To whom it may concern:

This bill is completely unnecessary and has no place in a country that preaches freedom of speech, in
fact which Australia helped to draft in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
_media and regardless of frontiers.”_

If the Federal Government has an issue with misinformation or disinformation, just refute it! No
wonder Australians have distrust with Government. If you did your job and governed for the good of
people, this wouldn’t be an issue.

This legislation should be abandoned.

Regards, Doug Mitchell,
