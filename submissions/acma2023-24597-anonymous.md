**Response to ACMA 'Misinformation/Disinformation' Bill 2023**

If passed, the so-called 'misinformation/disinformation' bill has the power to silence me and
my fellow Australians and indeed any dissenting voice. It is the greatest single threat to free
speech in living memory.

Nobody should have the power to tell me what to see/believe or not to see/believe. As an
intelligent human being I have the freedom to research any information I am not familiar with
or would like more information on. But these differing views and information need to be
available to access and to enable informed decisions to be made personally by me – not by
anyone else and especially when their morals and integrity do not match mine.

I do not agree to someone else deciding for me what I will or will not hear or learn about on
digital platforms. The interpretation and criteria deciding the label of
‘misinformation/disinformation’ may be influenced by many factors including monetary gains
etc. This would not align with the values and morals of most Australians.

Most of the information on digital platforms over the past 3 years that was labelled
‘misinformation/disinformation’ has now been proven to be factual, honest, and correct but
was censored and hidden by people and organisations with an agenda resulting in financial
gain. There are many scientific and medical studies and reports, fact checked and correct, to
back this up which could have saved a lot of people from very real and serious harm.

I fail to see exactly what ‘serious harm’ is caused by people being allowed to access all
information and to make their own informed choice on subjects that matter to them or to
bypass or delete any offensive information as determined by them.

Stupidity and corruption will always be a human factor that determines what people believe
or do not believe or how ‘criteria’ is set. My right to freedom of information and to make a
personal decision on what I choose to see or delete, should not be threatened because of
stupidity, corruption, or the control of content on digital platforms.

_“Why these powers are needed: Misinformation and disinformation spread via digital_
_platform services is a major issue worldwide. The rapid spread of false, misleading, and_
_deceptive information online has resulted in a multitude of harms from disrupted public_
_health responses to foreign interference in elections and the undermining of democratic_
_institutions.” ……. This paragraph says it all! The rapid spread of information online has in_
fact saved many lives and alerted people to serious dangers to their health in the face of
experimental and unproven government public health responses. The only foreign
interference I know of is the way the Australian Government blindly followed the drama of the
foreign health advice without gauging the actual real and minimal threat to the Australian
people. This is exactly my point on what ACMA ‘criteria’ will destroy.

The so-called ‘powers’ ACMA will have to ‘encourage’ digital platform services to comply, will
quite obviously be forceful, restrictive, and determined by the ACMA agenda/criteria. I don’t
see any fairness or integrity being shown by ACMA to digital platform services at all.

This blatant attempt to control information that does not fit the narrative or ‘criteria’ is so
obviously an attempt to threaten free speech once and for all in Australia and is a direct
attack on the intelligence of the Australian people.
