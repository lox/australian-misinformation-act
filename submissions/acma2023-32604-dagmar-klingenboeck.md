Dear Officer,

**New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the**

**_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and_**

**_Disinformation) Bill 2023_**

1.  The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,

Communications and the Arts (the Department) have invited feedback on an

exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

2.  The Bill, if passed in its current form, would allow the Australian Communications

and Media Authority (ACMA) substantial, unilateral and discretionary authority to

govern all forms of media save those explicitly excepted from the Bill’s operation.

Such law would render Australia’s commitment to freedom of speech and

expression nugatory. The Bill is also, frankly, a poorly drafted piece of proposed

legislation that does not do enough to define the key terms it is reliant on to give

it any utility. Apart from being unworkable, such amorphism also renders the Bill

apt for misapplication by nefarious or negligent future and/or current members

of ACMA; or Government more generally.

3.  In this submission, we focus on the following key points, with recommendations

included:


-----

a.  What are Australia’s obligations with respect to freedom of speech and

freedom of expression?

b.  What does the Bill do and why is it problematic?

c.  Conclusion

# Children’s Health Defense Australia

4.  This submission is made by Children’s Health Defense Australia, a not for profit

organisation with the following objectives:

a.  To restore and protect the health of children by eliminating exposures to

environmental toxins, holding responsible parties accountable, and

establishing safeguards to prevent future harm to children's health.

b.  To make available to Members and the public information resources,

presentations, scientific and educational materials on adverse impacts

upon childhood health.

c.  To make available to Members and the public information resources,

presentations, scientific and educational materials for the guidance and

promotion of childhood health.

d.  To work with private and public bodies for promoting childhood health

free of preventable adverse impacts.

e.  To provide and coordinate meetings with, and information, submissions,

and presentations to private and public bodies responsible for

campaigns, policies, laws, programs, educational materials, or forums

involving childhood health.

f. To advocate on behalf of Members, children and families everywhere for

the protection of childhood health.

g.  To undertake representative legal actions on behalf of Members, children

and families everywhere against any measures, actions, programs,

policies, bodies, agencies, decisions, or laws, adversely impacting or

capable of adversely impacting childhood health.

5.  Children’s Health Defense Australia is the Australian chapter of Children’s Health

Defense, an American not for profit organisation founded in 2011.

6.  The Board of the Australian Chapter is comprised of the following Directors:


-----

l. Dr Astrid Lefringhausen (Virologist, Biologist); and

m. Peter Fam, LLB (Human Rights Lawyer).

7.  With its combined expertise in medicine, science and law, Children’s Health

Defense Australia is in a unique position to provide feedback on the proposed

Bills.

# A. Australia’s obligations with respect to freedom
 of speech and freedom of expression

8.  Australia is a party to the seven core international human rights treaties. 1 Mostly

relevantly, this includes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

(ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)

**Article 19 of the ICCPR – Freedom of Expression**

9.  The natural and most obvious Article to focus on from within those agreements is

Article 19 of the ICCPR, extracted as follows:

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall

include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all

kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the

form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

1 It is worth noting that the seven core international human rights treaties are merely

### modern distillations of much older principles. Jurisprudentially, freedom of speech and

 freedom of expression, for example, have been recognised as sacrosanct since the Magna

 Carta, and indeed, by many human societies for thousands of years prior.


-----

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article

carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be

subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided

by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre

_public), or of public health or morals._

10. It is important to say something at this stage about the exception presented by

Article 19(3) above. The Bill, in its definition of ‘Misinformation’ at Section 7,

incudes the qualifier that such information is “reasonably likely to cause or

contribute to serious harm”. We assume, therefore, that Parliament will attempt

to justify the clear encroachment on Articles 19(1) and (2) of the ICCPR that the

Bill allows by suggesting that it is compliant with Article 19 in general due to the

exception provided in Article 19(3). Such justification, however, would be a

misappropriation of the exception, and a dilution of the intent of Article 19 in

general.

11. We will provide more detail on the function of the Bill below, but in brief, it allows

ACMA the power to, among other things, create ‘Misinformation Codes’ and

‘Misinformation Standards’ which would apply to anybody who disseminates

information publicly save for those explicitly excepted from the Bill’s operation

(mainstream/professional media and Government).

12. The exception in Article 19(3) above states that the right to freedom of expression

“may be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are

provided by law and are necessary…for the protection of national security or of

public order, or of public health or morals” (emphasis added).

13. “Necessary” is a high bar. It is also a very specific phrase, referring to something

that is essential, and indeed, absolutely essential. In order for the Bill to claim

compliance with the ICCPR, and in particular with Article 19, Parliament must

justify why the Bill in its totality, and all of the individual powers it grants to ACMA,

are necessary for the protection of national security, public order, public health


-----

or morals. This would mean that there are no alternative solutions available to

the problem Parliament is trying to solve. It would also necessitate a particular

and precise explanation of what that problem actually is, and how the onerous

approach the Bill proposes would resolve that problem. None of that has

occurred.


**Recommendations:**

**1.  Specific particularisation of why the various powers granted to ACMA by the**

### Bill are necessary for the purposes outlined in Article 19 of the ICCPR,

 including reasons as to why less onerous approaches are not sufficient.


**Other Relevant Articles in the ICCPR**

14. There are two other Articles from the ICCPR containing rights which the Bill

threatens to impede. First, Article 1 of the ICCPR contains the right of self
determination, often referred to as the bedrock of human rights. That is;

1. All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right

they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their

economic, social and cultural development.

15. In today’s world, freely pursuing one’s economic, social and cultural development

is a process intertwined with and dependent on digital platforms, and the

internet generally. Most individuals and most businesses use websites and social

media platforms to share information. “Social and cultural development”

necessarily includes the interaction with, and sharing of, ideas online. All of these

processes have become integrated and intertwined. It would be a simplistic and

naïve view to claim that restrictions placed on people and their businesses by

ACMA with respect to what they can and cannot post on the internet would not

impede on their right to self-determination.

16. Article 18(1) is also relevant:

1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and

religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or

belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with


-----

others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in worship,

observance, practice and teaching.

17. Freedom of thought necessarily entails the freedom to express those thoughts,

and freedom of conscience necessarily entails the right to have access to a broad

range of information which might inform that conscience. Forcing independent

disseminators of information to comply with codes and standards imposed from

on high does not facilitate an environment where freedom of thought and

conscience are possible. Even Article 4, which states that “in time of public

emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is

officially proclaimed, the States Parties to the present Covenant may take

measures derogating from their obligations under the present Covenant to the

extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation”,2 does not apply to

Article 18, such was and is its import.

**The Convention on the Rights of the Child – Taking into account and Protecting the**

**Rights of Children**

18. In its current form, the Bill, the Guidance Note and the Fact Sheet indicate that

the drafters have completely failed to consider the impact of the Bill’s operation

on children. This is particularly unsatisfactory given that not only are the majority

of users of the internet parents/guardians of children, but it is estimated that one

in three users of the internet are children themselves. 3 The internet is also used

as a tool for education and research in all educational curriculums across the

country. Any attempt to regulate the internet must therefore carefully consider

the impacts and potential impacts on children.

19. The Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines a number of rights which the

Bill would impact negatively. Article 3, firstly, states as follows:

1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or

private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities

2 It is worth noting the care with which the drafters of the ICCPR, and its signatories in agreeing to it,
included very strict exceptions to the rights contained within, triggered only by events that were,
without exaggeration, existential.

-----

or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary

consideration.

20. It is clear, as stated above, that the best interests of children have simply not

been considered in the drafting of this Bill.

21. In addition, there are several Articles relevant to a child’s right to express

themselves freely; as well as a parent’s right to provide direction to their own

child accordingly. Article 12, firstly, states as follows:

Article 12

1. States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or

her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters

affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in

accordance with the age and maturity of the child.

22. Article 13 is a more direct protection of the right to freedom of expression:

Article 13

1. The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall

include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all

kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the

form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice.

2. The exercise of this right may be subject to certain restrictions, but

these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; or

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public),

or of public health or morals.

23. And, with respect to freedom of thought and conscience:

Article 14

1. States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought,

conscience and religion.

2. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and,

when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the


-----

exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving

capacities of the child.

24. If the Bill was allowed to pass; it is unclear whether the Codes, Guidelines and

Standards that it purports to allow ACMA to register and create would apply to

children. On current reading, one would have to assume that they would. This is a

serious issue given the prevalence of content created for, and created by,

children on the internet. It would simply be inconsistent with the current criminal

law in Australia for children to be subjected to the criminal and civil penalties that

the Bill proposes, but that is what the Bill currently suggests.

25. The capacity and maturity of children is also a factor which must be taken into

account. Is a child expected to understand and comply with a “misinformation

code” that ACMA produces in the same manner that an adult might be? It is not

difficult to encounter the issues that an insufficient consideration of children,

their rights and their frequent use of the internet, as consumers and creators,

poses for the Bill. These issues render the Bill broken.


**Recommendations:**

**2.  Explanation of the purported interaction of the Bill with children generally,**

**as well as the rights contained within the CRC.**


**Enforceability**

26. There is an unfortunate impression in Australia that because the ICCPR, the CRC

and other treaties and covenants have not been ratified into domestic law that

they are totally meaningless. Such an interpretation totally divorces Australia

from its obligations under those instruments, rendering the citizens of Australia

without meaningful human rights protections. It also ignores the fact that, as a

nation, we have covenanted into those agreements, including agreeing to uphold

them, and failing to do so renders our collective word meaningless in the

international sphere.

27. Beyond that, the argument that the treaties and covenants are ‘meaningless’ is

also an oversimplification of the true state of play. The ICCPR, for example,

requires signatory governments to create statutory bodies with the power to


-----

oversee and ensure that Governments comply with the rights and protections

within. In Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) created

the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) who as one of their explicit

statutory functions within that Act are obligated to, among other things; 4

(e) to examine enactments, and (when requested to do so by the

Minister) proposed enactments, for the purpose of ascertaining whether

the enactments or proposed enactments, as the case may be, are, or

would be, inconsistent with or contrary to any human right, and to report

to the Minister the results of any such examination; and

(f) to:

(i) inquire into any act or practice that may be inconsistent with or

contrary to any human right; and

(ii) if the Commission considers it appropriate to do so—

endeavour, by conciliation, to effect a settlement of the matters

that gave rise to the inquiry…

28. The AHRC, therefore, has an obligation to examine the Bill to ascertain whether it

is inconsistent with any human right (we say it clearly is). In addition, Section 11(f)

arguably allows the submission of complaints by people who might be affected

by the Bill, if passed, on the basis that their right to freedom of expression has

been curtailed (for example). The AHRC, and the Department, should be aware of

this. There could be an avalanche of complaints given the poor drafting of the Bill

and the broad and unchecked power it purports to give to ACMA.

29. In addition, under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 all new Bills

must be accompanied by a Statement of Compatibility, which assesses the

compatibility of the proposed legislation with the rights and freedoms recognised

in the seven core international human rights treaties that Australia has ratified,

including the ICCPR. Such statement should be publicly released immediately

given the gravity and proposed scope of the Bill, so that the public can

meaningfully consider whether the Department has paid appropriate mind to

4 Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth), s11.


-----

those rights. In addition, the necessary establishment of a Parliamentary Joint

Committee on Human Rights should occur early and in a transparent manner for

the same reason.

30. There is, within the Bill, an accommodation for, and an acknowledgement of, the

implied freedom of political communication that the High Court has held exists as

an indispensable part of the system of representative and responsible

government created by the Constitution. 5 As a result, at several points, such as in

the creation of ‘Misinformation standards’ the Bill says that ACMA;

…must consider:

(a) whether the standard would burden freedom of political

communication; and

(b) if so, whether the burden would be reasonable and not excessive,

having regard to any circumstances the ACMA considers relevant.

31. If it is not already obvious, the above provides illusory protection. The framing of

it, firstly, renders ACMA the sole arbiter, at its sole discretion, of whether the

standard (in this example) burdens freedom of political communication, and in

any event only forces them to “consider” the possibility, rather than to ensure

such a burden is avoided or mitigated in any tangible way. In addition, ACMA is

left to adjudge reasonableness based on “any circumstances [it] considers

relevant”. This is, all in all, hardly an effective protection of one of the only human

rights that our Constitution protects; albeit via implication. Thankfully, to the Bill’s

credit, Section 60 does exclude the operation of the Bill itself, as well as any rules,

codes or standards created under it, to the extent that “their operation would

infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political

communication”. However, this is only the bare minimum, given the High Court

has emphatically recognised the existence of that right within our constitution.

And, problematically, the construction of Section 60 invites retrospective

correction via litigation, as opposed to ensuring ACMA pays appropriate mind to

the right in the first place.

32. By way of comparison, it is worth examining the following extract from the Fact

Sheet:6

5 See Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1 and Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v
_Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106; reaffirmed in Unions NSW v New South Wales [2013] HCA 58._

6 Fact Sheet, Page 7.


-----

**Code of practice registration**

Should the ACMA determine that stronger action is needed to protect

Australians, it could request that a section of the industry put in place a

new and more effective code of practice (than the existing DIGI voluntary

code of practice, for example). Once the ACMA is satisfied a draft code

presented to it by industry meets a number of criteria, it may register it

which makes compliance with it compulsory for all digital services

providers in the relevant segment of the industry. This would include

those providers who chose not to sign up to a voluntary code.

33. The ‘DIGI voluntary code of practice’ (the DIGI Code) referred to above, which the

Fact Sheet somewhat ominously suggests that ACMA may find ineffective and

subsequently replace, is a current, voluntary code of practice which several of the

largest social media companies in Australia have already subscribed to.

Interestingly, that Code does something which the Bill does not do, which is to

include explicitly, as one of its ‘Guiding Principles’, an acknowledgement of

freedom of speech and freedom of expression, as follows: 7

2. Guiding Principles

2.1. Protection of freedom of expression: Digital platforms provide a vital

avenue for

the open exchange of opinion, speech, information, research and debate

and

conversation as well as creative and other expression across the

Australian

community. Signatories should not be compelled by Governments or

other parties

to remove content solely on the basis of its alleged falsity if the content

would not

otherwise be unlawful. Given its subject matter, the Code gives special

attention

to international human rights as articulated within the Universal

Declaration on

7 Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation; the Digital Industry Group Inc.
(DIGI); published 22 February 2021.


-----

Human Rights, including but not limited to freedom of speech. Signatories

are

encouraged to, in developing proportionate responses to Disinformation

and

Misinformation be cognisant of the need to protect these rights.

34. The above extracted principle suggests a sound approach. By centering itself on

the foundation that the open exchange of opinion and ideas is vital to a

democratic society, and that such openness is vital to human rights protections,

the DIGI Code is able to provide a much more tangible approach to the control of

online information. That is, that “signatories should not be compelled by

Governments or other parties to remove content solely on the basis of its alleged

falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful”. There is no such

acknowledgement, and no such attempt at reasonable mitigation of power, in the

Bill; and it is concerning, to say the least, that the Fact Sheet (and the construction

of the Bill itself) suggests that the DIGI Code may be deemed insufficient, in

circumstances where the proposed replacement is woefully drafted and befitting

of corrupted and/or negligent application.


**Recommendations:**

### 3.  The Department and the AHRC should collaborate to ensure, as per the

 AHRC’s statutory function, that the Bill is compatible with Australia’s

 human rights obligations at international law;

 4.  The Department should immediately release the Statement of Compatibility

 for public scrutiny, and confirm the establishment of the Parliamentary Joint

 Committee on Human Rights with respect to the Bill;
 5.  Stronger, proactive protections for the implied right to freedom of political

 communication;

 6.  Include Guidance Principles within the Bill that make clear the importance

 of freedom of speech and expression, and which force ACMA to

 acknowledge these rights when making decisions;

 7.  Follow the DIGI Code’s lead in ensuring that content producers should not

 be compelled by Governments or other parties to remove content solely on

 the basis of its alleged falsity if the content would not otherwise be unlawful.


-----

## B. What does the Bill do and Why is it Problematic?

**The Bill’s Stated Intention**

35. The Bill has been released to the public for comment alongside a ‘Guidance Note’

and a ‘Fact Sheet’. Both of those documents seek to justify the Bill’s existence by

stating that “misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and

wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy”. 8

36. There are also several comments made in an effort to mitigate any perceived

overreach within the Bill. For example:

a.  “The ACMA will not have the power to request specific content or posts be

removed from digital platform services”;9

b.  “the Bill is directed at encouraging digital platform providers to have

robust systems and measures in place to address misinformation and

disinformation on their services, rather than the ACMA directly regulating

individual pieces of content”;10

c.  “rules made under the Bill may require digital platform services to have

systems and processes in place to address misinformation or

disinformation that meets a threshold of being likely to cause or

contribute to serious harm”; 11

d.  “the proposed ACMA powers will support the success of the voluntary

industry code currently in place”;12

e.  “the proposed powers will only apply to misinformation and

disinformation that is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious

harm”; 13 and

8 Fact Sheet, page 1.

9 Fact Sheet, page 1.

10 Fact Sheet, page 2.

11 Fact Sheet, page 2.

12 Fact Sheet, page 3.

13 Fact Sheet, page 3.


-----

f. “the proposed powers are designed to encourage digital platform services

to be accountable for improving and implementing measures to counter

the spread of misinformation and disinformation online (i.e. they have a

‘systems’ focus rather than an individual content focus”.14

37. With respect to the interplay of the proposed powers that the Bill would grant to

ACMA and freedom of speech and expression, the Guidance Note states as

follows:

The proposed powers seek to strike a balance between the public interest

in combatting the serious harms that can arise from the propagation of

misinformation and disinformation, with freedom of speech.

The Bill aims to incentivise digital platform providers to have robust

systems and measures in place to address misinformation and

disinformation on their services, rather than the ACMA directly regulating

individual pieces of content. The Bill does not seek to curtail freedom of

speech, nor is it intended that powers will be used to remove individual

pieces of content on a platform. The proposed definition of

misinformation and disinformation is intended to provide guidance on

the types of harms the powers are designed to address. The concept of

‘serious harm’ is intended to ensure that the ACMA’s use of its powers,

and the platforms’ systems and processes, are targeted at harms with

significant implications for the community.

38. In brief, the Department wants to say that the Bill:

a.  is necessary to protect Australians from misinformation and

disinformation, which is harmful;

b.  allows ACMA powers which will only be used when and if necessary

(being, in circumstances where the industry does not adequately

regulate itself); and

c.  is targeted towards digital platform companies, rather than individuals.

14 Fact Sheet, page 4.


-----

39. All of the above may very well be a genuine expression of the intent of the

Department in drafting and proposing the Bill. However, problematically, there is

a significant chasm between those stated intentions and purported safeguards,

and the wording and proposed operation of the Bill itself.

**What does the Bill do?**

40. In brief, the Bill would enable ACMA three broad powers:

a.  to gather information from, or require digital platform providers to keep

certain records about matters regarding misinformation and

disinformation;

b.  to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to

combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which

the ACMA could register and enforce; and

c.  to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of

regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in

combatting misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.

The Bill places unacceptable restrictions on any Individual who posts content online

41. As noted above, there is a stated intention within the Fact Sheet and Guidance

Note that the Bill is aimed at ‘digital platform providers’ and not at individual

content or posts. This, however, despite misleading assertions to the contrary in

the Fact Sheet and Guidance Note, is not how the Bill actually works.

42. The Bill makes clear that “content is provided on a digital service if the content

is…accessible to end-users using the digital service”.15 In addition, a “service is

provided to the public if…the service is provided to at least one person outside

the immediate circle…of the person who provides the service”.16 The above

definitions taken in tandem mean that an individual who posts content online

which is accessible to more than one other person is captured by the various

15 The Bill, Section 9.

16 The Bill, Section 10.


-----

powers the Bill grants ACMA. That individual (any person, including a child, who

posts something online) would need to comply with any digital platform rules, or

misinformation codes or standards, that ACMA implements under the Bill. That

individual would also be subject to the severe civil and criminal penalties that the

Bill implements if those codes/standards are breached.

43. This approach is, quite frankly, an unacceptable and inappropriate imposition of

executive regulation on the citizenry of Australia. It is a flagrant dismissal of the

rights to freedom of speech and expression Australia has covenanted into

protecting. It would render any citizen who chooses to express themselves in a

digital form subject to regulatory frameworks that have not even been created

yet, unilaterally imposed by ACMA, and not subject to meaningful challenge. That

is not the way a democratic society works. It would signal the end of the internet

as a free market of ideas and opinions and render criticism of Government, an

essential element of any healthy democracy, vulnerable to civil and criminal

prosecution. With respect to children, it poses unacceptable and ill-defined risks

upon their use of the internet, irrespective of their age or capacity.


**Recommendations:**

### 8.  Amend the definition of ‘digital service’ to clarify and ensure that an

 individual who posts on a social media platform is outside of the scope of

 the Bill’s operation.


The Definitions of Misinformation, Disinformation and Serious Harm are vague, and as a

result are not functional

44. The Bill is predicated on the idea that ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ are

harmful to Australians; and that Australians must be protected from it via

Government regulation. It is therefore essential to consider the definitions of

these terms within the Bill, which in many ways are at its centre.

45. The definition of ‘misinformation’ within the Bill is as follows:17

(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, dissemination of content using a

digital service is misinformation on the digital service if:

17 The Bill, Section 7(1).


-----

(a) the content contains information that is false, misleading or

deceptive; and

(b) the content is not excluded content for misinformation

purposes; and

(c) the content is provided on the digital service to one or more

end-users in Australia; and

(d) the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably

likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.

(The Misinformation Definition)

46. The definition of ‘disinformation’ within the Bill is functionally similar, except that

it includes an additional qualifier, being that “the person disseminating, or

causing the dissemination of, the content intends that the content deceive

another person” (emphasis added). 18

47. The primary issue with these definitions is that they rely on an assessment that

the impugned information is “false, misleading or deceptive”. None of the terms

“false”, “misleading” or “deceptive” are defined in the Bill itself. This may be

because what is considered “false or misleading”, or what is considered truthful,

is rarely straightforward. In science, for example, there is no such thing as ‘truth’.

There are only hypotheses, based on data and evidence, which themselves are

frequently subject to change. A collective and unchallenged scientific position is

rare – and even then it will seldom be referred to as ‘truth’, but merely the best

available current theory. It is a dangerous idea to suggest that only ‘true’

information should be allowed to be disseminated to the public, when not

everybody agrees on what is ‘true’ and what isn’t. Such an approach will have the

consequence of stifling scientific debate; and particularly in areas of current

controversy, which are usually the most pressing and important. 19

18 The Bill, Section 7(2).

19 It is useful to consider the pandemic as an example of these issues. Throughout 2020 and 2021, the
World Health Organisation frequently changed their recommendations with respect to several aspects
of pandemic management, due to the constantly changing nature of the science and evidence. The State
and Territory Governments were similarly turbulent in their recommendations; many of which have
subsequently proven to be incorrect. If the Bill had been passed before the pandemic, thousands of
Australians who shared their opinions, often evidence based, on these recommendations could have
been found to have engaged in ‘misinformation’; despite later being vindicated as the science and
evidence properly emerged. This would be an unacceptable, counterproductive and dangerous state of
affairs.


-----

48. The Guidance Note states that “ACMA [will not] have a role in determining what is

considered truthful”.20 This is misleading. While the Bill itself doesn’t explicitly

allow ACMA to define or determine what information is true, misleading or

deceptive, it does allow ACMA the power to create enforceable and compulsory

rules, codes and standards that will do just that. The Bill also creates an obligation

for ‘digital platform services’ to themselves define those terms, because if they

don’t, for example, “prevent or respond to misinformation on digital platform

services”21 they may be subject to civil and criminal penalty. In this way, the

drafters of this Bill have avoided the impossible task of drafting definitions of

“false, misleading or deceptive” by passing the buck to social media companies,

without considering that it will be impossible for those companies to properly

define those terms themselves. The result of all of this will be ACMA and/or digital

media companies arbitrarily, and without proper qualification, frantically

determining what is true and what isn’t, in a world where what is true and what

isn’t is constantly changing. It will be a mess for ACMA, for digital platforms and

for individuals; with civil and criminal consequences. The uncertainty this creates

would almost certainly result in censorship out of caution in an effort to avoid

potential liability.

49. This is not helped by the definition of “serious harm” that the Bill includes, which

is itself more of a principle of guidance than a definition, imbued with enough

subjectivity to make the purported definition meaningless. Section 7(3) of

Schedule 1 states:

7(3) For the purposes of this Schedule, in determining whether the

provision of content on a digital service is reasonably likely to cause or

contribute to serious harm, have regard to the following matters:

(a) the circumstances in which the content is disseminated;

(b) the subject matter of the false, misleading or deceptive

information in the content;

(c) the potential reach and speed of the dissemination;

(d) the severity of the potential impacts of the dissemination;

20 Guidance Note, page 7.

21 The Bill, Section 33.


-----

(e) the author of the information;

(f) the purpose of the dissemination;

(g) whether the information has been attributed to a source and, if

so, the authority of the source and whether the attribution is

correct;

(h) other related false, misleading or deceptive information

disseminated; and

(i) any other relevant matter.

50. This is particularly concerning given that one of the primary checks and balances

that the Guidance Note and Fact Sheet point to is the idea that it is only

misinformation that might cause ‘serious harm’ that the Bill seeks to mitigate.

Unfortunately, as is clear from the construction of the Bill, “any other relevant

matter” could be seen to characterise information that is “reasonably likely to

cause or contribute to serious harm”. It is a catch-all definition with boundaries

insufficient for the conveyance of any real meaning. Such definitions are apt for

negligent and intentional misuse.


**Recommendations:**

### 9.  The current definitions of ‘Misinformation’, ‘Disinformation’ and ‘Serious

 Harm’ within the Bill are unworkable. Given that the Bill rests upon these

 definitions, this renders the Bill itself unworkable. The definitions should be

 amended such that they are not contingent on the identification of “truth”,

 but are rather aimed at capturing content that is of a criminal character, or

 which constitutes a criminal offence.


**The Principle of Legality**

51. If the Bill is allowed to pass in its current or in a comparable form, such

amorphous definitions will pose issues for future Courts in their attempted

interpretation of it. Via what is commonly known as the principle of legality,

Brennan J noted in Re Bolton that “unless the Parliament makes unmistakably

clear its intention to abrogate or suspend a fundamental freedom, the courts will

not construe a statute as having that operation”. In this case, the Bill is

supposedly intended to strike a balance between protecting Australians and

ensuring freedom of speech and expression. Inherent in that stated intention is


-----

an acknowledgement that freedom of speech and expression are important, and

the Guidance Note and Fact Sheet both espouse this view as well. The issue is

that the Bill is unclear on the extent to which it seeks to abrogate those rights;

and the vague definitions within do not help. In R v Secretary of State for the Home

_Department; Ex parte Simms [2000],22 Lord Hoffman stated as follows:_

the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront

what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot

be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is

too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may

have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of

express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts

therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be

subject to the basic rights of the individual.

52. The Bill is, contrary to Lord Hoffman’s well-known judgment, and as outlined

above, riddled with generality and ambiguity. It incorporates a disingenuous

attempt by its drafters to state an affinity for freedom of speech and expression,

despite offering several mechanisms for those rights to be curtailed. It is difficult

to imagine how a Court will properly interpret the terms of the Bill in the

inevitable contests that would follow its passing, particularly in light of the

principle of legality.


**Recommendations:**

### 10. The drafters of the Bill must be clear in their intentions. At present, the

 Guidance Note and the Fact Sheet say one thing whilst the functionality of

 the Bill suggests something else. This will result in complex and costly

 litigation;

 11. If the Bill is to be allowed to pass, stronger protections for free speech must

 be incorporated into it, which would require a drastic re-drafting of the Bill.

 Anything less should not be allowed, because freedom of speech and

 expression are such fundamental rights in our democracy.


22 2 AC 115, 131.


-----

**The Bill allows ACMA too much Power**

53. On its current construction, the Bill allows ACMA inappropriate power:

a.  First, it allows ACMA to unliterally govern the digital content creation

space by creating rules, codes and standards which every single producer

of content on the internet must comply with; and

b.  Second, it turns ACMA into a quasi-judicial body capable of holding what

are essentially ‘misinformation hearings’ involving other quasi-judicial

powers such as the forced production of evidence.

54. With respect to the former, it is rare that a piece of legislation allows a

Government body unchecked authority to create enforceable rules without any

meaningful checks and balances in place. The reason for this is demonstrated by

the Bill’s current construction. On current construction, if the Bill is passed, ACMA

could create and then enforce rules, codes and standards that contain anything

ACMA wants; without oversight, and without the ability for users of digital

platforms, or those platforms themselves, to question or challenge those rules

(unless ACMA decides to incorporate these mechanisms within those rules, codes

or standards). The provision of this arbitrary rule making authority subverts

representative democracy while granting ACMA a head of power not found under

the Constitution.

55. Although the Guidance Note and Fact Sheet, and elements of the Bill’s

construction, suggest that ACMA’s creation of codes and standards would only

apply in circumstances where the industry does not sufficiently regulate itself,

this is, again, not how the Bill actually works. ACMA, for example, is given

authority by the Bill to simply choose not to register a code which industry

creates.23 In addition, if ACMA in its sole discretion determines that a code

created by industry is “deficient”, it can simply create its own codes and

standards. A code is “deficient if, and only if, the code is not operating to provide

adequate protection of the community from misinformation or disinformation on

the services”.24 Again, this is an amorphous definition which essentially allows

23 The Bill, Division 4, Section 37.

24 The Bill, Section 48.


-----

ACMA unfettered discretion to unilaterally declare a code deficient, based on a

definition of ‘misinformation’ that is already itself broken. This is further

exacerbated by the additional power that the Bill grants ACMA to “determine

standards [in] emerging circumstances”; that is, that ACMA only needs to consider

it “necessary or convenient” (emphasis added) to create standards “in order to

provide adequate protection for the community from misinformation or

disinformation on the services”.25 The use of the word “convenient” betrays the

intent of the drafters; the discretion offered to ACMA is designed to be as broad,

and as difficult to challenge, as possible. The test, in its current drafting, is

basically meaningless.

56. Of additional concern are the quasi-judicial powers that Division 3 of the Bill,

innocuously titled “Information gathering” grants to ACMA. Apart from allowing

ACMA to, in any circumstance where it “considers that it requires the

information”, require a “digital platform provider” (recall the scope of that

definition) to provide to ACMA any “information, documents or evidence” it

desires,26 it also allows ACMA to force an individual “to appear before the ACMA

at a time and place specified in the notice to give any such evidence, either orally

or in writing, and produce any such documents”, at risk of civil penalty for non
compliance. 27 That is, on any reading, a subpoena power designed to force

individuals (and representatives of corporations) to provide written and oral

evidence on demand. There is no concession for any potential breaches of the

state or federal privacy statutes, and the Bill even goes so far as to ensure that

“an individual is not excused from giving information or evidence or producing a

document or a copy of a document under this Division on the ground that giving

the information or evidence or producing the document or copy might tend to

incriminate the individual in relation to an offence”.28 That is, even the protections

available to defendants in the criminal charge and hearing process are not

afforded to digital platform providers (which again, can be individuals) under this

Bill. The provision of this unbounded quasi-judicial authority subverts the rule of

law and common law rights, while granting to ACMA a star chamber-like authority

not afforded under the Constitution. Again, it is not clear whether such power is

intended to apply to children, but the wording of the Bill does not exclude

25 The Bill, Section 49.

26 The Bill, Section 18.

27 The Bill, Sections 18 and 19.

28 The Bill, Section 21.


-----

children from the operation of this purported power. It should go without saying,

but allowing a Government department statutory authority which might force

children to engage in what is essentially a hearing is an unacceptable breach of

the safeguards afforded to children in this country by the legal system and

structure, such as the age of criminal responsibility, and the general exceptions

for civil liability afforded to children in most jurisdictions.

57. These powers are, in their current form, a clear attempt to wrap an iron fist

around the sharing of information online by forcing content creators to front up

and provide evidence before a murky Government body with an incredible and

unprecedented degree of discretion to mete out civil and criminal penalties. It is a

threat wrapped in a regulatory nightmare; and it completely ignores the

legislative protections for the sharing of private information that already exist in

Australia.29


**Recommendations:**

### 12. Stronger checks and balances need to be incorporated into the Bill such that

 ACMA is not allowed unchecked, unilateral, unchallenged power to create

 codes, rules and standards;

 13. Statutory mechanisms for review and challenge of ACMA decisions must be

 incorporated into the Bill, with external and independent oversight that is

 timely and efficient;

 14. ACMA’s discretion should be limited and couched within clear parameters

 for reasonable assessment by a Court;

 15. The Bill must include a Clause excepting the provision of any information

 that would render the provider in breach of Privacy legislation.


# C. Conclusion

58. When the public is no longer the arbiter of truth, and that role becomes usurped

by bureaucrats and governments, history suggests that the resultant censorship

erodes the public's collective trust in authority.

59. In its current form, not only is the Bill unworkable and illogical, but it betrays a

fundamental lack of understanding, or lack of care, for the human rights of

29 See the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and all State and Territory equivalents.


-----

Australians; and in particular for the right to freedom of speech and expression. It

is unlikely that minor amendments will be enough to save this Bill. Its sponsors

provide no evidence to justify the intrusions it proposes into the private and civil

autonomy of Australian citizens, whilst purporting to vest unrestrained

investigatory, quasi-judicial and non-reviewable policing power into a body

without Constitutional authority. Should such laws be enacted there is little doubt

that complex litigation will ensue. The impact on the Australian legal system could

prove to be detrimental to the administration of the entire legal system.

60. As it stands, we fundamentally and vehemently oppose this Bill. If such law is

allowed to pass, it will not only signal the death knell of the internet as a free

marketplace of ideas in Australia, but it will signal to Australian citizens, and to

citizens of the globe, that the Australian Government seeks total control of the

dissemination of information within its borders, and that such control is more

valuable to that Government than the individual rights of its citizenry. That would

be a dark day for democracy indeed, were such a thing to pass.

Sincerely yours,

CHD Australia
