Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

**Powers** **to** **Destroy** **Free** **Speech**

These powers are anathema to a free and democratic society and will have a demonstrably chilling
effect on political and non-political discourse in this country. Further legislation is not even needed
as defamation law already protects against reputational harm which is sufficient.

In a free and democratic society one is either for, or against free speech. If in favour, those in power
must trust in the good judgment of the public to discern so-called 'misinformation' and
'disinformation' by themselves (it’s called DYOR: “do your own research”). It is apparent that the
Government/ACMA [GA] are either against having such a society, do not trust the public, or both.

Further, what supernatural power(s) does GA claim to possess in discerning truth over and above
the average citizen? None. In fact, government and its apparatus have often been purveyors of
misinformation and disinformation during the past, particularly in relation to COVID-19 (e.g.,
lockdowns, masks and injections as inviolable 'solutions').

The final tragedy is this legislation exempts GA and ‘approved’ news media from the very standards
imposed on everyone else, an act of sublime hypocrisy.

I end my submission with the number one trait of a sociopath, which would apply to GA seeking to
control others’ speech:

# “1. A Hunger for Power & Dominance

Both sociopaths and psychopaths are commonly found at the head of corporations, governments,
and in positions of great power. This may be no coincidence. Sociopaths have a tendency to be
power-hungry and may spend a lot of time and effort attaining positions where they can control,
dominate, and have authority over others. Once they obtain power, they commonly misuse and
abuse it in ways that are irresponsible, destructive, and harmful to others.”*
