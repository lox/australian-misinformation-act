World, with unelected bureaucrats providing no transparency or accountability on what constitutes harm, misinformation or
disinformation. The vague interpretation of 'harm to people, the economy or environment; contributes to or reasonably likely to
cause or contribute serious harm' leaves the door open wide for action to be taken against anyone who disagrees with the
narrative that the government wants to promote. the fact that the governments are exempt from this proposed legislation tells it all.
There is no acceptance of contradicting the government narrative, even if someone is attempting to tell the truth. The fact that
education providers are also exempt is also proof that no one will be able to contradict what these institutions say; and what they
are saying and teaching in many areas at present is not only not true but extremely damaging and dangerous to children and
society.
The basis of a true free democracy is the contest of ideas which requires freedom of speech.
This proposed legislation is in breach of our rights under the Declaration of Human Rights (article12) and as such cannot be
justified.
It proposes the situation where truth is irrelevant and where free speech, democracy, human rights and government accountability
are no longer relevant and need to be suppressed. It is textbook 1984 Ministry of Truth and has no place in Australian law and
life.
