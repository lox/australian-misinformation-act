Regarding : Proposed changes to the ACMA /legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I have read the details available to me detailed on the internet on this day the 14/07/2023 and only believe one change should be
made detailed below.

1. I believe the changes should also include authorised electoral and referendum content and other types of content such as
professional news and satire as it has a detrimental impact directly on the community of Australia and not to be excluded.
