**Communications Legislation Amendment (combatting Misinformation and**
**Disinformation) Bill 2023.**

I submit that this Bill is dangerous and a direct attack on my freedom of speech and
freedom of expression, and has no place in a democracy.

In a healthy democracy no small group should have the power to silence individuals
or groups especially using the terms Misinformation and Disinformation. Terms that
are subject to personal interpretation and personal prejudice.

It is my right to have access to all information and points of view so that I can form
my own opinions and decide what I believe to be the truth. In my opinion the
government could be accused of spreading misinformation during COVID, given their
claims that you could not catch covid if you took the vaccine was later proved to be
false. You may disagree with me and that is your right.

Yours Sincerely

Linda McDonald
