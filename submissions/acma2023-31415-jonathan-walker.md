To report on misinformation, you must define what is true. Without a definition of truth, it is
impossible to say what misinformation is. Truth is an exploration. It is not a static single point.
Herein lies the issue with this bill.

A democracy can only exist if freedom of expression exists. The ability to freely debate makes it
possible to find something nearer to the truth than the current position. We find truth through the
exploration of ideas. Social Media is often how this debate occurs.

The government does not hold a monopoly on truth. It gets things wrong, as does any individual. If a
government has the power to define truth, then it can not be challenged.

At some point in history, governments would have believed that the world is flat. To think that the
world was round would represent "serious harm" to people since if they were to travel, they would
fall off the edge and die. If this happened today, this bill would eventually lead to the idea being
censored. We would still be living on a flat planet.

This bill doesn't understand the concept of truth or what is excellent about a democracy. Instead, it
wants to cripple truth to create a false sense of safety. The world isn't safe, and the only way we
have to combat it is through continuous debate. People get information wrong but eventually selfcorrect. Truth changes over time. It sucks, but it's all we have.

This bill will lead to a static position on truth, eventually creating the very thing it claims to solve.
Leave people alone to do what they do best. This bill is a mistake.
