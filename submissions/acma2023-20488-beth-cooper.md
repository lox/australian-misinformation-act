**SUBMISSION**

**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**

**Disinformation) 2023**

As a retired newspaper journalist and federal government public-affairs officer, I fully
understand the difference between misinformation and disinformation, two worlds that have
never been properly explained to the Australian people.

Simply put, MISINFORMATION is incorrect information, either telegraphed accidently or
deliberately. DISINFORMATION is information that dissents from the approved narrative of
either governments or other organisations.

In other words, “disinformation” is nothing more than propaganda, whether used for good or
bad.

As a federal government employee (1976-2012), I both witnessed and practised
disinformation on behalf of the Australian federal government, although at the time I believed
my doing so to be in the best interests of the Australian people.

Over the past two decades we have witnessed the growth of social-media platforms that have
more and more encroached into the realm of traditional media outlets.

While these platforms, on the face of it, could and should have furthered the cause of
democracy throughout the world, more recent information that has come to light proves the
opposite.

We have watched as these platforms have and continue to censor individuals for posting
thoughts and ideas that may oppose the various narratives certain governments are
“propagandising”.

And as alternative platforms have been opened and closed down by government and
establishment forces over the past two or three years, until Elon Musk bought Twitter and
Truth Social opened its platform to Australians, there was no social-media forum available in
Australia that allowed any opposition views to be put forward.

This weaponisation of government should not be present or even tolerated in an open and free
society, and certainly not in any nation that likes to call itself “democratic”.

We’ve all seen the misinformation and straight-out propaganda spewed out from our
governments, established corporate enterprises and legacy media outlets over the past few
years. Much of it was overkill that, in fact, had the opposite effect on the Australian people.

Within one or two days in early 2020, our entire half-hour or hour-long news broadcasts
became COVID updates. No other news from around the world was even reported to
Australians on any TV channel. What’s more, Sky News Australia even opened up a separate
COVID channel for the fearful to doom out on.

Any intelligent person could have picked up that this was nothing more than disinformation
(propaganda) being trafficked by governmental forces to the Australian population and based
on Fascist ideology.

This was the first patently obvious globalist-concocted disinformation campaign played on
the Australian people and the world during my lifetime, although I have witnessed many
smaller campaigns in the past.

This government and corporate disinformation campaign then led into a more sinister
propaganda crusade of coercing and forcing the Australian people into taking a drug that was
still in its experimental stage of development and which had “unknown” side effects that
included heart failure among others.

This rang loud bells in the heads of those of us who had bothered to keep up to date with the
global (UN, WHO, WEF, IMF, etc) agenda for the world in the 21st century.

And what is even worse, Australia is still pushing this propaganda while most of the world
has abandoned it.

Although, in Australia, we don’t have a Bill of Rights and “rights” as laid out in the US’s
First Amendment, it has always been understood that free speech was a “birthright” in our
“democracy”.

Since the 1950s I have witnessed right after right and freedom after freedom being taken
from us at a very slow and gradual rate at first to almost a flood inundating us over the past
decade.

This has occurred in such a way that those born after me would not see it as clearly or as
definitively as I do.

I view this Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) 2023 as just another step towards the tyranny we in Australia have come to
expect from our governments and “installed” representatives of global forces.

World history can teach us a lot and the wheel was invented centuries ago, but we, in
Australia deny both.

Did we not learn anything from our two world wars, particularly World War II and the
legislation the Nazi Party imposed on the people of Germany and elsewhere in Europe?

I see PRECISELY the exact same thing occurring right now in the Western world and we in
Australia appear to have been the globe’s “testing ground” for much of it.

Our global politicians like to use the term “democracy” when they are, in fact, talking
tyranny. Is the “democracy” they mention nothing more than their “democracy” – democracy
for an elite breed of individuals at the expense of democracy for the people who pay their
salaries and comfortable lifestyles?

When will most of these so-called “elite” individuals realise that they themselves are merely
the foot soldiers of the true global “elite”.

As we saw after World War II, these foot soldiers were expendable to their masters and were
those who faced trials at Nuremburg while their masters escaped all punishment.

More people than our governments realise have been closely following global events for
many years and can see the same playbooks being used over and over again.


-----

If our governments truly believe they have pulled the wool over the eyes of the people, such
legislation as this proposal will soon open a groundswell of dissent.

Perhaps our legislatures need to remind themselves of a fable they may have been told in
their childhoods about the boy who cried “wolf” and to realise that putting foxes in charge of
the henhouse is no answer to our nation’s problems.

I worry for the future of our children and grandchildren of this once beautiful and prosperous
nation that I remember.

GOD HELP US FOR NO-ONE ELSE WILL
