This proposed legislation is the most dangerous ever tabled in the Australian Federal Parliament and
represents a direct threat upon any remaining true personal freedoms including free speech,
personal sovereignty and an individual’s security in Australia. If enacted it will give completely
unwarranted and underserved power to unelected officials who can then arbitrarily shut down any
internet enabled discourse and disclosure upon critical moral, ethical and potentially life-threatening
issues within this country.

Throughout the COVID-19 incident of 2020-2023 the Australian public was patently subjected to
direct government interference and stifling of public debate about facts completely pertinent to
COVID-19 and it’s subsequent handling and policies. This was reflected also in main stream media
reporting about COVID-19 which appeared to be in “Lock Step” with the government’s insistence
upon their certain version of “facts” about the disease and its subsequent approach to treatment
and management. The erroneous and deceptive nature of the Australian government’s position
upon certain “government endorsed facts” is clearly demonstrated in the Australian government
and main stream media insistence upon SARS-CoV-2 virus being of Zoonotic origin since 2020, but
which now clearly appears (and is now accepted in the wider scientific community and has been
tabled in Governmental hearings in the USA) that this virus is of man-made / synthesised origin. We
also continue to have government stifled and controlled reporting upon the efficacy and safety of
supposedly called “COVID-19 vaccines”, which to date have arguably killed tens of thousands of
people in this country alone (from official ABS statistics, excess deaths since the introduction of
COVID-19 vaccines are in the order of 5000% higher than previous reporting periods). Another
proven fact that the Australian government appears to ignore and dis-endorse is that COVID-19
vaccines in no way actually protect an individual from contracting COVID-19. So bad is the situation
with respect to the actual complete lack efficacy of supposed “COVID-19 vaccines”, the Australian
government has actually had to run a parallel campaign pushing anti-viral medication in order to
somewhat effectively treat COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The farce continually pushed by the
Australian government throughout the COVID-19 incident has been embarrassing to say the least
and this proposed legislation is completely intended to allow the Australian government future
unfettered ability to push any version of their facts about anything they wish, without any wider
public scrutiny, criticism or consequence.

In no way should the Australian government and its related departments be given any more control
or power over free speech in this country. In light of the one example above which highlights the
Australian governments “version of facts” throughout COVID-19, which have subsequently and
clearly been proven to be deceptive and false, this proposed legislation should be scrapped
immediately.
