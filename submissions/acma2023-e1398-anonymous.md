The proposed 'Misinformation Bill’ is wrongheaded and dangerous.

Who will be the Arbitrator of what is misinformation or truth?
Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because it’s easy to
see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Meta said that the law would have a “chilling” effect on free speech. It
would be easy for a government to label as “misinformation” anything that could hurt its reputation (as many authoritarian
governments already do). Giving the government such unrestricted power is terrifying.
It is unconscionable to allow this Bill to be put into legislation.
Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false. We need
debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this vital process.

It’s easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found inconvenient. The
proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed.

Please reject this proposed law.
