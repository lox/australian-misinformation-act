Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinforma�on and disinforma�on (the Communica�ons
Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023)

To whom it may concern.

The last three years since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared have demonstrated clearly that our
Cons�tu�onally-guaranteed rights to breathe freely, choose what we will and will not allow in our
bodies and even our ability to educate our children or ourselves and be able to con�nue working at
our careers has been restricted.

Now, the Commonwealth wants to take things a step further and determine what we can and cannot
say or even think by holding the social media pla�orms accountable for ‘allowing’ us to have
freedom of poli�cal speech. Your power must really be tenuous if the only way you can hold onto it is
by suppressing any and all debate.

It’s not as though either the Morrison or the Albanese government has actually go�en anything right
over the en�re dura�on of the so-called pandemic. This is what these governments were guilty of:

1.   They promised that the COVID injectables would keep those who took them safe from COVID
infec�on, only to be shown that they were unable to prevent infec�on in those who took them. Even
worse, they were well-aware of this fact at the �me the jabs were first provisionally approved and
they suppressed this informa�on – even though they knew it was correct.

2.   They promised that those who took the COVID jabs would not just protect themselves, but
those around them. They vilified informed Australians who wanted evidence of safety before
agreeing to be injected, calling them granny-killers and worse, whilst knowing all the while that these
jabs had never been tested for their ability to stop transmission. In other words, they lied to the
people they were supposed to be serving.

3.   They enforced the wearing of masks – even in young children who were psychologically scarred
by this ac�on – even though they knew that there was no evidence that masks – even N95 masks –
could prevent the spread of a viral illness.

4.   They ordered social distancing even though there was not then nor is there now any scien�fic
evidence to show that this ac�on would prevent even one infec�on or save any lives.

5.   They wouldn’t allow people to visit their elderly rela�ves in nursing homes, enforcing a cruel
isola�on whereby many people died early and alone. People undergoing treatment in hospital
se�ngs had to do so without any support and even children were forcibly separated from loving
parents due to their policies of torture in order to cement total control. And tyrannical State
Premiers under their watch refused to allow the treatment of innocent Australians, leading to the
deaths of babies and young people. Democide at its most obvious.

6.   They locked down or allowed lockdowns of en�re ci�es and communi�es, militarising the police
force to beat, abuse and illegally harass Australians who were simply trying to live their lives. Again,
there was no evidence that lockdowns would do anything other than destroy lives, businesses and
communi�es. Perhaps that was their ul�mate goal?

7.   They allowed the uncons�tu�onal closure of State and Territory borders, separa�ng families
further, keeping people from their employment and stopping commerce and communica�on despite
the lack of infec�ons in Australia at that �me.

8.   They forced healthy people to undergo a medical procedure, using a PCR test that was incapable
of diagnosing an infec�on, run at a cycle threshold so high, it was guaranteed to show false posi�ves
in people without any symptoms.

Why am I raising these issues with you when you may feel they have nothing to do with the
proposed legisla�on?

The only reason why these governments were able to get away for so long with these ac�ons was
because the legacy media was totally complicit. They suppressed alterna�ve viewpoints completely;
they used some of the most egregious hate speech to describe those who simply wanted to make
informed health choices; they ignored or berated those who had been harmed by these jabs and
they refused to report the scien�fic papers published in the peer-reviewed literature demonstra�ng
what the Government already knew – that these jabs were ineffec�ve at preven�ng infec�on or
transmission and were causing permanent injuries and deaths in unprecedented numbers of
Australians, young and old.

The other side of this issue was only available on social media and in the alterna�ve broadcast
media. This might not have posed such a problem for the authori�es if it weren’t for the fact that
more and more people were ignoring the mainstream and availing themselves of the data being
reported by non-Government-approved sources.

Democracy dies in darkness and apparently, ACMA by obeying those who would use their power to
silence our voices, would be conspiring with vested interests to keep Australia in permanent night.

Australia already has laws in place to protect people from hate speech or threats.

ACMA should not be the arbiter of what is mis or dis-informa�on – especially when, as demonstrated
above, the Government has been the leading purveyor of both.

The answer to scien�fic or poli�cal controversies isn’t more censorship – it’s more debate. We at the
AVN know this very well because – even before this legisla�on was proposed, we have been the
vic�ms of a coordinated campaign of censorship including having our YouTube, Facebook, Instagram
and LinkedIn accounts cancelled without reason or explana�on.

So we absolutely oppose any laws which would empower ACMA or any other Australian body to
restrict in any way our right to communicate freely and openly on any issue whatsoever.
