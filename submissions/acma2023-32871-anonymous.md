To the 2023 Parliament of Australia

I am certain I speak for thousands of Australians if not more, who may not know that this Bill is being introduced,
or feel too incapable of responding to the introduction of it, or who are just too lazy to care about the nation, and
thus are part of the problem rather than being part of a much-needed solution.

The elites in this nation no longer represent the heart and soul of Australia. Unfortunately, they have succumbed
to the lure of excessive wealth and power, as have so many equally in other Western nations, and have abandoned
the protection of their nation's culture and inheritance.

Politicians only what "Regime change" and it certainly has arrived behind closed doors to the point that YOU, our
"honourable" politicians are basically now serving the agendas of the UN and EU while pretending to be serving
those of the people of Australia.

This Bill deprives every Australian citizen of having free speech and that is exactly the core of
Marxist/Communism/Socialism.

Diggers in two World Wars sacrificed their lives to protect us from this totalitarian tyranny, and to now see it
being introduced into this nation by its "leaders" is sickening beyond belief and is only to the benefit of politicians
and not the nation as a whole.

I give you all absolutely NO consent to proceed with this Bill and will ask my God to deal with those that
introduce it in the same way I have indicated I would towards the introduction of Digital ID.

Both are part and parcel of this transformation of this once-free nation to become a nationwide concentration
camp, similar to what we find in China under the CCP.
