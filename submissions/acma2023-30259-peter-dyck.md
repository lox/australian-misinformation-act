It is my will that you be made aware of my feeling toward the proposed legislation

My will dictates that this bill must be scraped in its entirety and protection put in place to protect free
speech in this country.

We have seen the government sensor free speech already with the covid debacle. It now appears many
of the things removed were correct and accurate. By giving power to unelected officials the government
is handing over the rights of the People of this once great country.

It is my will to scrap this misinformation disinformation bill and to put in place true protections for free
speech.
