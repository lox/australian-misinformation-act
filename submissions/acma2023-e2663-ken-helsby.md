The Government should not give new powers to ACMA to determine what is
misinformation or disinformation. The move towards a Surveillance State is alarming.
Why does Australia need to become China in this respect?

Truth usually surfaces in the end, despite governmental attempts to suppress it.
We need media of all kinds to disseminate news, information and opinions.
These competing sources enable the people to decide for themselves what is
right and what is wrong. I am sick and tired of the Govt, treating us as stupids.

Throughout the Covid era governments and public health were the prime source
of disinformation and misinformation. How can we trust anonymous fact checkers,
many straight out of university with little life experience to tell us what is true, what is right,
and hide information from us?

The Government's moves in this area are frightening and despicable.
We must fight off the Dystopian/Orwellian State!
