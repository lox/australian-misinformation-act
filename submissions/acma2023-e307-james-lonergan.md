As a broadly educated individual, I find this motion a complete decimation of what is good, sensible, logical, or rational.

No one in The Australian Government has the right to decide for everyone else what is true or not. Full stop. That’s it. It also has
no right to shut down dissenting voices. Government agencies have not only consistently failed to identify the truth amongst the
noise, but they’ve lied, forged data, hidden corruption, and proven their ineptitude to anyone with a brain who’s watching. This is
too far.

Government and MSM are treating the adult population here like children (and children like adults). It’s evident that no one in
any position of power in our country have a clue the actual intellectual capacity of our communities.

If you want to question, who am I to have anything important to say? This is who i am.

I am James Stephen Lonergan the 7th.

My Great Great Great Grandfather built the first house on Lord Howe Island EVER, out of driftwood in 1853. My two
grandfathers both fought for Australia in world war and lived to 90 each. My father served the Australian Government for his
entire career and recently was awarded a National Emergency Medal. My mother served as the only full time nurse on Lord
Howe Island, she’s a hero. I am years old, and have an IQ of 150+. I look after myself, I love my huge extended family, and
I build businesses for a living to solve actual problems for actual humans.

At this point I am completely ashamed of our Government, and so should you be dear reader for grifting off your government
cheque, working on this tripe. It is my opinion that anyone working in any capacity on this dis/misinformation nonsense should all
be out of a job, and given free bachelor degrees in modern history instead. And sadly, dear reader, that’s why you’re going to
continue pushing for these ‘powers to control the minds of dumb people’, because you can’t afford to be out of a job.

I welcome a phone call or real life conversation with ANY human willing to (diplomatically) debate me on this topic.

The actual truth will always win. My vote is that you put a stop to this power grab before you cause any further harm. I hope the
Government starts listening to its own people.

Sincerely,
James Stephen Lonergan

Labor Party: I’m appalled at your entire organisation from the top down,
and all around.
