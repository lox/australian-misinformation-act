_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and_
_Disinformation) Bill 2023._

I am writing to express some of my concerns and opposition to the Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

As an Australian citizen, I strongly believe that this bill undermines the fundamental
principles of freedom of speech and fails to address the complexities surrounding
misinformation and disinformation. Article 18 and Article 19 of The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) emphasizes the rights to freedom of thought,
conscience, religion, opinion, and expression.

It is my right to raise concerns about the integrity of politicians, government
employees or any personnel who deem that they have the right to stand over or have
any control over any information or truth (which you term as mis/disinformation).

If there is some scepticism even after information has been provided on any
democratic process, it is none of any governments business. It is governments and
institutions responsibility to respond to any concerns by ensuring that their processes
are accountable and transparent.

It will also remove the ability to access truth and protest Government mistakes, bad
policy and deprive Australians of their inalienable rights.

This bill should actually apply to the “Australian Government” and their funded media
who seem the most guilty of peddling mis/disinformation, and it appears both are
excluded from this bill.

Also ‘posing a threat’, should be replaced with ‘causing harm and death’,(which
reflects the lies, propaganda and gaslighting we have been subjected to over many
years). If the key words ‘mis/disinformation’ are replaced to the more accurate ‘truth
and scientific fact’, we can see it is a threat to the preferred narrative by government
‘for the safety and well-being of all Australians’.

At no stage have I voted for or agreed to the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG’s) including Net Zero policies of the foreign/overseas corporations dictated by
the UN, WHO, WEF. These SDG’s clearly show that every problem facing the
people are reflected by excessive government decisions, and Australia will thrive
when freed from these SDG’s.

The ACMA legislation is entirely indefensible. I do not consent.
