# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

I hereby express my concerns about the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, as announced by the
Minister for Communications.

I appreciate the motivations behind the Bill, and acknowledge that it will not place the ACMA or
any other department of government in a position to determine truth or falsehood, and that this will
remain with the social media companies themselves. However, notions of truth and falsehood and
the potential for harm caused are likely to vary from one social media company and another, or
even change when a company acquires a new owner. There might also be situations where
government takes a more restrictive view of the potential for harm caused by a certain piece of
misinformation than a social media company. The Bill does not appear to address these situations.

I am in general disagreement with policies that infringe freedom of speech. Much of what is
accepted as fact today was considered radical and outside the realm of serious discussion not so
long ago, as the information available to us and societal attitudes changed over time. Our scientific
understanding of the world is always evolving and subject to political realities, our recent legalising
of cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin for treating depression and other ailments being a case in point.
The “chilling effect” of this piece of legislation should be a cause for concern for all Australians
who wish to have online discussions on new and challenging ideas. I am in agreement with the
draft insofar as it excludes private messaging.

Naturally and unavoidably, the conspiracy minded will interpret this legislation as vindication of
their views. Alternative social media platforms will experience a surge in traffic, and overseas
based ‘alternative news’ pages will remain accessible, as the internet knows no borders. If we were
to pass this legislation, foreign regimes who make a habit of clamping down on free speech would
be further empowered to say in response to criticism: ‘Tu quoque’.

A better alternative to this (and similar) legislation that would address the root cause of the problem
would be bringing in critical thinking courses in schools that deal with misinformation and
propaganda and how to spot it, thereby better preparing future generations for the digital world.
This Bill comes across as defeatism in the face of the technological space we must now all navigate
in.
