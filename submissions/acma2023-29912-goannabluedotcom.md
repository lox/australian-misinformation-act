**Section 2 Definitions does not define the terms “false” or “misleading”**

I strongly recommend the words “false” and “misleading” be included in Section 2 and
defined to:

  - Give them a meaning which is consistent with everyday expectations

  - Make it clear who (person, body, institution or other body) can determine whether or
not information is “false or misleading”

  - Impose the obligation on the those who may classify the information as “false or
misleading” to provide the content creator with the justification for the classification

  - provide a mechanism by which the creators of the information may challenge the
classification.

  - Provide a mechanism to allow periodic review and reclassification to recognise that
information may at an initial point be classified as “false or misleading” but
subsequent events or further information may provide that initial classification to be
incorrect.

**Section 2 Definitions defines “excluded content”**
**Section 6 defines Excluded services for misinformation purposes**

It is unclear if “excluded content” (which is acceptable under the proposed Act) is still
acceptable under the proposed Act if it appears on a “service” which is classified as a “non
excluded” service in section 6.

I strongly recommend a wording amendment to make it clear that “Excluded Content” is
always excluded and will remain excluded under the proposed Act regardless of the
“Service” or “Medium” on which it is made visible or promulgated.
