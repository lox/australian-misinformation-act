Dear Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and
the Arts committee,

I write to voice my opposition to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023. The bill must be scrapped in its entirety. I also
call for all restrictions on speech to be removed including all anti-discrimination legislation.

Absolute free speech is a non-negotiable in Australian society. Every Australian must have
the right to openly discuss all positions on any issue, whether it be race, sex, sexuality, wars,
pandemics or any other issue. Only through vigorous and open debate can we reach
consensus. This must apply to all in real life, legacy media and online.

The government is a social institution not a scientific one. It is not the role of government to
determine what the ‘truth’ is nor to force that ‘truth’ on its people. Such a system that is
ruled by ‘experts’ is called Technocracy. This is an elitist and inequitable system akin to
Communism and incompatible with our Democracy.

And who fact-checks the fact-checkers? Who in ACMA decides what is mis/disinformation?
What metrics do they use? How do we keep these people to account? Or is ACMA one of
these miraculous self-regulating bodies like the shitshow which is ASIC?

The most stupefying element in this bill is the government exempting itself. What an
absolute farce. If any entity has more moral hazard for spreading mis/disinformation it is
government (WMDs and the gulf wars anyone?).

What is true or not is irrelevant to politics; what matters is what the people want. The
government works for, and represents the people. The people decide what the truth is.

Different faiths and cultures believe different things. Things that might be ascientific and
ahistorical but are nonetheless important to their wellbeing as a community.

The nature of even science and history changes. Things which were commonly accepted in
these fields change when new information comes to light. How can this process of truthseeking take place if it is stifled by government?

As for the specific example of burning down 5G towers. Regardless of whether they cause
harm or not, when did the community vote to have these put up? If the government refuses
to listen to peoples’ concerns, what other recourse do they have but to engage in extrapolitical activities?

This Misinfo Bill is a desperate power grab at authoritarianism by a government which is
losing control of its narrative; which has lost touch with its’ people and frankly doesn’t care.
Terminate this Bill in its disgusting entirety.

You are becoming irrelevant. The future of democracy is decentralised.

Regards,

Danny Kooyong
