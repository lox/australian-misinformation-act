 ACMA – Proposed powers

 I believe that the proposed change to legislation is not necessary. ACMA was created to protect people from scams and false claims by snake oil salesmen. This should remain as its role. It does not need the power to decide what is right and what is wrong, and who has the valid opinion. Fact Checkers have been proven in court to be people who have the ability to flag or remove another persons’ posts, because those posts propound a different opinion to their own, the important word being OPINION.

 This proposal is basically saying that apart from government and government agencies, nobody else is allowed to have and express an opinion. It appears the only place that debate is permitted is in parliament, whereas it used to be the right of every person, to argue/debate/discuss their point with/against those who had different opinions.

 This is where good ideas come from and bad ideas are rejected, free discussion and debate.

 I am over 60 and have not needed parental guidance on what I say or think for very many years. This is telling me that I can think what I like, but I do not have the right to express my opinion. The government, however, can say and broadcast whatever they want with impunity.

 The past 3 years have provided abundant proof that the government is the largest single source of the most harmful dis/misinformation, which they have disseminated via MSM. Not only do they lie and manipulate statistics to back their claims (YES, this has been proven many times over, and by their own admission), they refuse to admit that they made poor decisions, and that information which is freely available from other countries proves the inaccuracy of the Australian Government and Health Department press releases and still they refuse to accept, acknowledge and disseminate these proven facts.

 The proposed changes are neither wanted nor needed. We are currently being treated like ignorant children by those who are forgetting that they are our servants, not our rulers.
