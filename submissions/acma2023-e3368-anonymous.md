Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I wish to be heard on the proposed “Misinformation Bill”, which I feel is disgraceful. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right and must be safeguarded, and intended or not, this Bill will damage free speech.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
