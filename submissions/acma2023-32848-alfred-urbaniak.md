To the 2023 Parliament of Australia

I am certain I speak for thousands of Australians if not more, who may not know that this Bill is being
introduced, or feel too incapable of responding to the introduction of it, or who are just too lazy to care
about the nation, and thus are part of the problem rather than being part of a much-needed solution.

I arrived here from Poland when it was still under Communism so unlike many who think
Marxism/Socialism/Communism are wonderful ideologies to promote and embrace, I know better, and
this Bill basically ushers in Communism and all of its inherent deterrents, restrictions, consequences,
and punishments.

In the time I have lived in Australia, I have seen it ever so slowly being transformed into the
dysfunctional society it is becoming and is destined to further become.

The elites in this nation no longer represent the heart and soul of Australia. Unfortunately, they have
succumbed to the lure of excessive wealth and power, as have so many equally in other Western
nations, and have abandoned the protection of their nation's culture and inheritance.

Gillard called for "Regime change" and it certainly has arrived behind closed doors to the point that
YOU, our "honourable" politicians are basically now serving the agendas of the UN and EU while
pretending to be serving those of the people of Australia.

This Bill deprives every Australian citizen of having free speech and that is exactly the core of
Marxist/Communism/Socialism.

Diggers in two World Wars sacrificed their lives to protect us from this totalitarian tyranny, and to now
see it being introduced into this nation by its "leaders" is sickening beyond belief.

I give you all absolutely NO consent to proceed with this Bill and will ask my God to deal with those that
introduce it in the same way I have indicated I would towards the introduction of Digital ID.

Both are part and parcel of this transformation of this once-free nation to become a nationwide
concentration camp, similar to what we find in China under the CCP.
