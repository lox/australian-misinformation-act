I find this bill ‘ undercooked’ and extremely discriminatory.

Firstly the major misinformation platforms were are exposed to are mainstream media, political
advertising, and shock jocks such as those on 2GB etc who LNP, Labor and One Nation politicians cue
up to be associated with.

Once again I see our government trying to undermine human rights for political advantage.

“Article 19

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing
or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties
and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as
are provided by law and are necessary:

(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;

(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or
morals.“

Media release from politicians, especially LNP, one nation and Labor in particular are not scrutinized
by media, especially political advertising.

Whilst there are serious issue on social media (Algorithms should be banned) especially:twitter/ x,
Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat ( which is a source of Greenwashing/ gaslighting and DV). However, it
provides mass communication and a source of great information. Social media does provide a lot of
factual information we don’t get from government or mainstream media, especially through YouTube
and Facebook and zoom links.

We see NO genuine accountability against mainstream Media, like sky (Fox News), Ten, Seven, or 9
mega networks which include 2GB etc. some regional stations are just as bad.

We have seen so much wrong doing condoned by the two party system, Just like Banking Bad, Robodebt, Aged care disaster, attack on whistleblowers like Richard Boyle, Alan Kessing, Dave Reid (Lucas
Height whistleblower) and so many more.So many Royal Commissions where recommendations are
not implemented. Child abuse covered up.

Here a great example of hypocrisy and the foreseeability of main stream media not for the good of
the public: https://youtu.be/1HJ8xAqBJW8

This legislation, just like the voice has been seen as a smoke screen.

Yes indigenous people need a voice in the constitution, section 51 xxvi should be removed from the
constitution too.

If Labor wanted to give indigenous people a voice they should act in good faith, listen now to
indigenous people. If so, they would stop native forest logging today. Stop further gas and coal mines
protect country, not rape it, for the benefit of their sponsors. Then more people would support the
voice which is desperately needed.

We need to review all media outlets for disinformation/ misinformation. Yes there needs to be
genuine accountability but who can we trust to do that? Government needs to Walk the walk. We
have so much corruption and distrust of governments in Australia we can’t trust them to oversee this
legislation.

Put this bill aside, let’s make this a wholistic approach. The Labor conference has proved that the
Prime Minister is not serious about addressing misinformation/ disinformation. It starts at the top.

We have so many Prime Minister who have and still providing misleading, misinformation/
disinformation. This has gone on for too long. It’s not just PM Albanese.

Given our governments have sold us out for some time, built so much mistrust we rely on
independent media, social media as a source of accurate information. Fact checking is problematic,
but voluntary codes of conduct or governmental intervention over independent media sources,
social media and professional groups will be catastrophic for our so-called democracy.
