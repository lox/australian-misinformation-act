Submission to Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I will keep my submission to this bill brief.

I read the bill, the guidance note, and the fact sheet.

I then read the excellent joint submission by Maat’s Method and Australians for Science and
Freedom, with which I wholeheartedly agree.

Those of us who have seen the Australian governments’ inhumane, unjustifiable and absurd
measures during the covid period can easily recognise this bill for what it really is: as a
continuation of an obvious anti-democratic power-grab by government over the citizenry.

During covid, all Australian governments were apparently desperate to define what is the truth
and silence any dissenting views, even though many such views were not only entirely
reasonable, but, as it turns out more and more, correct - whilst governments were spreading
disinformation over a prolonged period and propagandising the population.

A government entity as ultimately the last arbiter of truth… this is 1984 in action. The proposed
laws are completely unacceptable in any democratic society.
