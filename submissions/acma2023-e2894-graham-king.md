### Submission:

##### Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Truth is kryptonite to liars, deceivers, fraudsters, malevolents, quacks, thieves, murderers,
politicians, governments, corporations, tyrants and psychopaths.

The only reason for this Bill is that the above mentioned bad actors of this world are
demanding cover for their heinous deeds committed.

The truth is what exposes these sick individuals and entities for what they really are.

But ‘our’ government, ‘our’ public service, ‘our’ elected representatives, and almost all of
‘our’ regulatory agencies are captured by and corrupted by these bad actors.

Captured to the degree that these same bad actors are demanding government censorship and
propaganda to supplant the truth, facts, evidence, data, critique, debate and exposure in order
to hide the crimes they’ve committed against us, the people of Australia.

An example: the truth denounced as ‘conspiracy theory.’
It’s an easy and much used deflection for ‘our’ captured governments, ‘our’ mainstream
pharma-owned legacy fake-news media, ‘our’ social media platforms and criminal-corrupt
bad actors named in the conspiracies.

But,

…. well actually it’s closer to a week these days.

The reality is that we the people, should be demanding that governments, government
departments and agencies, the mainstream fake-news media and the search engines and
social media platforms STOP spreading officially promoted false narratives approved by
massive cartels and corporations and demanded by these corporations for profit and

compliance. Corporations that are deeply linked to ‘our’ government, its departments and
agencies.

The Australian TGA is a very good example. 96% of it’s funding coming from the companies
it supposedly regulates and polices.

The real conspiracy is between politicians, corporate executives, government and
government departments and agencies with corporations and unelected supra bodies such
as the United Nations, the World Health Organisation, the World Economic Forum and a
plethora of corrupt Foundations.

I am amazed that ‘our’ Australian government is even considering this measure.
Parliament is a forum for debate, a foundation of the democratic process.
The mainstream fake-news media used to have a policy of ‘balanced reporting,’ but that
seems to have been thrown out in the garbage with true democratic process as well.
The internet, which in the early days was lauded as a forum for all has been corrupted.
The alternative digital news, which is what this Bill is all about silencing, is where the real,
fact-evidence-data based, corroborated news is available for people interested in finding
the truth of what is happening.

Why not let people decide for themselves? Let people see ALL the information.
People are pretty smart. They can smell a rat.
And it must be a pretty big rat, because the smell of it extends from coast to coast.
But seriously, what is the real problem here?
When has censorship ever been needed in a democracy?
Only when government is behaving badly.

On the other hand, it’s obvious why ‘our’ government is wanting a ‘Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation Bill.

The alternative real news media is winning the information war and the only way the
government

[and the corporations which own it – Pfizer for example, or the supra-national
unelected bodies which ‘our’ government has signed away ‘our’ sovereignty to – the
UN, the WEF and the WHO for example]

has any hope of surviving its incompetence and corruption, it’s nefarious agendas, and
cover for the criminal corporations it colludes with - is to censor real news.

Pfizer for example is a criminal corporation. ‘Our’ government aids and abets Pfizer
and its profit-for-depopulation agenda. Pfizer has had numerous criminal convictions
with billions of dollars in fines levied against it, but ‘our’ governments -Federal and
State- actively deal with it. They turn a blind eye to it’s criminal-corrupt history.

Once real news is censored, all that’s left is pro-government [pro-Pfizer] propaganda.

A fascist state.

I’d like to add the article by Steve Kirsch that follows below as a reasonable and effective
remedy for the Misinformation and Disinformation that ‘our’ government seems so worried
about. It should be implemented world-wide, especially in the 5 Eyes group of nations
where the covid depopulation agenda has been deployed so thoroughly, where the Great
Reset is well underway and where Bill Gates is welcomed like a head of state and given
personal immunity from all crimes he may or may not have committed.

# A golden opportunity to stop the vaccine misinformation spreaders

## We all agree that misinformation is a huge problem that costs lives. We just disagree on who is spreading it. To settle the issue, we are open to challenges from our scientific peers.
##### Steve Kirsch

#### Executive summary

##### I believe it’s time to see if we can resolve disagreements between top scientists on important scientific topics where there is abundant data in the peer-reviewed literature on which to make a determination, e.g., “Are vaccines fueling the autism epidemic in America?”

 In this article, I propose a way to discuss these issues in a public forum in a way that will enable Americans to be better educated on key health issues facing America today.

 The idea is very simple.

 We will put together an expert PANEL who holds a belief (“B”) opposite that of the scientific consensus (“A”) on a top issue. 

 We will then call for qualified CHALLENGERS from all over the world to challenge these experts in a public forum by:

 1. arguing that the key studies supporting B are all seriously flawed 

 2. and/or arguing that the key studies supporting A are highly credible.

 Regardless of the outcome, if there are 10 or more challengers, the PANEL will vote to award a cash prize (currently $5K) to the CHALLENGER with the most compelling argument. This way, there is both a monetary and public interest incentive for challengers.

#### How it works

##### A panel of experts who hold views contrary to the “medical consensus” on a selected topic will appear on a public virtual debate stage and allow qualified individuals to challenge their views.

 This presents an ideal opportunity to resolve many outstanding important medical issues on which there is a difference of opinion among top scientists.

 If nobody shows up to challenge this unprecedented collection of “misinformation spreaders,” they will become even more powerful, which is exactly the opposite of what governments and health authorities want to happen.

 I believe that the American public will find the discussion dispositive.

#### To apply to challenge the PANEL

##### Register here.

 You can see who has registered here.

#### Reasons to challenge the panel

##### 1. The single best way to stop misinformation and save lives is to discredit
 the misinformation spreaders. Other methods have proven to be ineffective. 

 2. A unique opportunity to discredit 20 of the world’s top misinformation
 spreaders in as little as 15 minutes.

 3. Opportunity to win the cash prize.

 4. International recognition if you can successfully challenge the panel.

#### The rules

##### 1. Challengers must pre-register a summary of their argument(s) and up
 to 5 supporting papers. This makes the discussion fair since the panel will have time to prepare. 

 2. You can challenge our beliefs and evidence. Or you can advance any
 evidence you believe proves that we are wrong. Or you can do both. Here’s a list of some of our evidence.

 3. Qualified challengers include licensed doctors, scientists with an h index>=5, and any scientist working for any HHS agency (CDC, FDA, NIH, …).

 4. The floor time will be extended in 15 minute increments if the panel
 believes the issue isn’t resolved, e.g., both sides.

 5. Both sides will have an equal amount of talk time on an issue. So if the
 challenger has a total of 15 minutes, so will the panel. This keeps the conversation flowing since both sides are incentivized to be succinct.

 6. After all challengers have appeared, if there are more than 10 qualified
 challengers who appeared, the panel will vote for who will receive the cash prize for the best argument. This is meant as an additional incentive to encourage people to challenge the panel.

 7. Ad hominem attacks are not allowed. Anyone doing so will be ejected
 from the discussion by the moderator.

 8. Only registered challengers can speak.


-----

##### 9. You can sign up as a group or as an individual so long as each member
 of the group qualifies. The group can be as large as you want. We like group challenges because it’s more time efficient for everyone.

 10.We will supply a neutral moderator with medical expertise who is
 known not to have an opinion on the issue being discussed.

#### Topic: Do vaccines cause autism?

##### Let’s get this process started with a topic that is important to resolve ASAP.

 We’ve had over 25 years of research studies on the topic of vaccines and autism and yet there are prominent scientists on both sides of this issue. 

 Both sides cannot be right. 

 With nearly 400 studies published in the peer-reviewed literature (most supporting the linkage), how is it possible that we can’t figure out which hypothesis is consistent with all the data we have? 

 This is a trillion dollar problem. 

 Following the medical consensus has made the problem dramatically worse over the past 30 years. Shall we avoid debate and blindly follow it for another 30 more?

 Our experts believe that the evidence is clear that vaccines can trigger autism and believe that the people who believe otherwise are misinterpreting the evidence that does not find a connection. 

 We think that is time to try to resolve the ambiguity in a public forum.

#### Our expert panel for autism

##### In no particular order:


-----

#### Future topics

##### If this works well, future topics can include:

 1. Evidence-based medicine lacks a reliable way to achieve medical
 consensus

 2. RCTs should not be required to achieve scientific consensus on
 important issues

 3. COVID vaccines risks outweigh the benefits

 4. America would be healthier if we eliminated all vaccines

 5. Andrew Wakefield was right

#### The “excuses” for not engaging

##### 1. ‘I don’t have time:’ This is silly since for a small investment of a few
 minutes of effort, you can do something that governments have been unable to do: discredit 20 of the world’s top misinformation spreaders

 2. ‘Science isn’t settled through debates:’ We are just educating the
 public and debates like this are the ideal way to show the public who is telling the truth. Note that if the tables were turned and the other side did the same thing we are doing, we would all sign up immediately to challenge the experts.

 3. ‘It would be a waste of time:’ America will be watching. You’ll be able
 to reach millions of people and discredit the panel. This will save lives. Even if you just save one life, it’s worth it.

#### Why I am doing this

##### Do I expect anyone to challenge the panel? Nope. 

 This panel is so deep it would be impossible for anyone to fool them with fraudulent studies. Anyone trying to challenge the panel would lose. Badly. 


-----

##### This is not because any of us are skilled debaters; it is because all the evidence supports our position.

 The panel presents a challenger with a GOLDEN opportunity to set the record straight. The lack of any credible challenger, even with a monetary incentive, should make it clear to the world that the medical community is UNWILLING to DEFEND the “scientific consensus” on the world’s most important issues.

 There is a reason they are unwilling to defend the narrative: it is not defensible.

 And if the narrative goes down, it makes the entire medical community look foolish for blindly supporting it for decades. That’s why they won’t allow themselves to be in a position that they will lose. That’s why nobody will show up to our challenge.

 The COVID vaccine debacle has enabled this; large numbers of people are now realizing they were fooled. 

 This enables us to use this autism challenge to further erode confidence in the medical community which is exactly what needs to happen for any progress to be made. 

## Summary

##### Autism is a trillion dollar problem. It’s getting worse over time, not better.

 Many top doctors and scientists believe vaccines have nothing to do with the problem.

 Other top doctors and scientists believe that vaccines are fuelling the problem.

 They can’t both be right.

 If there is one thing the last 30 years have made clear: if the two sides never get together to try to resolve the ambiguity, this problem will never be resolved.

 Using intimidation tactics, censorship, or simply ignoring the issue are simply not the best way to resolve these important issues. They have been tried and they do not work. Autism continues to get worse.

 Is there a reason we cannot try to resolve these disagreements with a public collegial dialog among scientific peers?

##### We have over 30 years of evidence we can talk about. Isn’t it time to see if we can work together to figure out which hypothesis is most likely to be consistent with the evidence we have in hand? ..ends

Truth is kryptonite for liars, deceivers, fraudsters, malevolents, quacks, thieves, murderers,
politicians, governments, corporations, tyrants and psychopaths.

It is my will that my elected representatives oppose this travesty of a Bill, that, should it be
passed, will turn ‘our’ Australia into a terrible fascist-communist state.


-----

We deserve better than this from ‘our’ government, ‘our’ elected representatives, and
permanent Canberra that we pay the wages of. You/they serve us. But instead you/they are
screwing us.

I/we do not wish to live in a Fascist-communist state.
I/we do not wish to live in a state where freedom of speech has been cancelled.
I/we do not wish to live in a nation where mass murder has been legalised, where climate
fraud is permitted to prevail, where gender confusion is promoted and where education has
been dumbed down

I suggest we scrap ‘the Voice’ referendum and replace it with a referendum on adding

  - Freedom of Speech

  - Freedom of choice in medicine

  - and the creation of a parallel system of Naturopathic, Homeopathic, Traditional

medicine to compete directly against monopoly, Allopathic, profit-driven, sickness
maintenance ‘medicine.’

to the Australian Constitution, with the exact wording of the amendment is presented to
the Australian public, with all known benefits AND downsides presented and debated
before said Referendum…. Unlike what’s put before us now

What’s that got to do with Misinformation and Disinformation?

EVERYTHING

If this Bill is enacted there will be no debate, there will be no free discussion, there will be
no exchange of ideas, there will be no whistle-blowers.

There will be communism. There will be slaves and masters. There will be tyranny.

Freedom of Speech is vital to a strong, independent, healthy, vibrant nation.
‘Our’ government and it’s public service is infected with a virus that wants to destroy that.
This Misinformation and Disinformation Bill will ensure tyranny prevails.
It is a disgrace that ‘our’ government has fallen to this depth of depravity that it would even
suggest such a Bill, let alone pursue it’s enactment.

It is a travesty that ‘our’ government would formally impose censorship to assure it’s
corrupt agenda is permitted to prevail.

With Kind Regards,

GK
