# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Act 2023

This amendment confers unprecedented jurisdiction to the Australian Communications and Media
Authority. No authority, independent or otherwise, should have the power to determine, on behalf
of the Australian people, what is or is not ‘truth’ on digital platforms; nor should it have the
authority to declare what is within or outside the bounds of ‘freedom of political communication’.
These matters are the sole and fundamental responsibility of the individual living in a democratic
society. Democracy is defined as ‘Government by the people’. The Australian people must be left
free to govern themselves—to use their powers of critical inquiry to determine truth from
falsehood on digital platforms and to take responsibility for their own thoughts, decisions, actions
and beliefs. I strongly oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Act 2023.
