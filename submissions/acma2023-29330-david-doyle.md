_and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

# This is a Submission on the Albanese Labor Government’s ‘Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023’.

This Bill if implemented as proposed, would mean the Australian Communications and
Media Authority (ACMA) would be granted extremely broad new and enhanced powers to
combat harmful ‘misinformation and disinformation’ online, and to impose significant
financial penalties for non-compliance with the new restrictions where the terms
‘misinformation and disinformation’ are not defined and which can be used to censor
genuine, truthful, evidence based thought, opinion and expression contrary to inalienable
human rights.

This Bill is a direct attack on the inalienable human rights of freedom of opinion, speech
and expression seeking to empower a media watchdog, ACMA, to be the sole
determinator of what is harmful “opinion, speech and expression” and what is acceptable
in the public square through online services, placing the obligation on social media
companies to censor opinion, speech and expression.

The last three years has demonstrated the inordinate harm that such an approach has
occasioned I.e. colluding authoritarian censorship. The American President, the FBI and
department of Justice are being sued in America for their collusion and conspiracy with
Main Stream Media (MSM) and the Digital Social Media platforms, for denying Americans
their 1st amendment rights, right of freedom of speech, exactly what this Bill proposes to
do to Australians through a law. The actions of those American bodies censored truthful
and evidence based facts, opinion, debate, speech, science and expression, defaming
contributors who opposed or questioned the “official” narrative. This also occurred in
Australia.

The passing of this Bill will result in the continuation of such authoritarian (non democratic)
control and the continuation of defamation, vilification, deplatforming, deregistration, and
destruction of the lives and characters of highly trained, qualified and skilled experts and
the destruction of careers and livelihoods and businesses of citizens as has happened in
the last three years during the Covid pandemic and done so at enormous cost to the
Australian community and economy. During Covid the Governments, Regulators,
Bureaucrats, and the Media (main stream and social) used misinformation and
disinformation to the detriment of all Australians. They created fear, pushed false
narratives, implemented failed strategies which did not prevent infection or transmission of
covid, nor saved lives while at the same time silencing all voices of reason, science,
caution and calm who sought to promote truth and calm anxiety. Because such voices
were seen to be in opposition to the ‘official’ propaganda, they was silenced, as this Bill will
do in the future.

Since late 2021, official Government reports indicated the Covid-19 vaccine severely
damages the immune system with the potential to cause some new form of Covid-19
vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome among people who have received
multiple injections.

_and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

These claims were furiously denied by the mainstream establishment and authorities
despite the fact it was their data that blatantly outlined this was the case. But rather than
prove otherwise most Government agencies just decided to stop publishing the damning
data instead.

However, almost two years later, the authorities have quietly decided to begin an
investigation into Covid-19 vaccine induced Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome and
Antibody-Dependent Enhancement after scientists around the world, including many from
Harvard and Yale, were forced to admit a debilitating suite of problems have been
appearing hours, days or weeks after a Covid-19 vaccine has been administered.

But they have thus far decided to dub the condition ‘Long Vax’ in an attempt to trivialize the
deadly consequences of Covid-19 vaccination and give more credence to the alleged
condition ‘Long Covid’ which is otherwise known as hypochondria.

This Bill, if law, will be used to continue such official governmental and bureaucratic
censorship of truth and the promotion of lies, deceit, disinformation and misinformation.

Not only is the above fact but this Bill, if passed into law, will contravene internationally and
nationally agreed fundamental human rights, as the Covid experimental vaccine response
contravened the 10 points of the Nuremberg Code of 1947.

Problems with the BILL:

1. The Bill negates the fundamental human rights of “freedom of opinion, speech and
_expression” assured by the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human_
**_Rights, (in formulation of which Australia played an active role and the international_**
treaties that followed), many of these fundamental human rights being reflected in our
National and state laws, policies and programs. See below the specific articles of this
declaration which this Bill negates.

2. As stated the Bill will provide a general form of censorship and silencing. As Senator
Malcolm Roberts has stated “The information censorship being sought by this bill could
_easily include legitimate criticisms of the government, questions about the science_
_underpinning climate change ideology, questions about high immigration, questions_
_about gender dysphoria, and the ‘no’ campaign against the voice to Parliament. When_
_the ‘truth’ becomes a subjective tool for the government of the day, you have to ask,_
_who will be fact-checking the fact-checkers?”_

# - e.g. In the area of Christian teaching the Bill has the potential to forbid the

proclamation of the good news of salvation, holiness and purity through Jesus
Christ, prevent proclamation of the commandment of the creator God calling for all
to repent of Sin (for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God) and prohibit
publishing the warnings of pending judgment on those who practice evil.

_and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

# - Censoring laws like the one proposed are the kind found in totalitarian, fascist,

socialist and dictator regimes not in a democracy like Australia. They are designed
to:

     - Place control over the public appearance of the government, by the deletion of
any content that appears opposition, suspicions, or doubts about government
policies or programs.

     - Place a constant check of the public opinion as a measure of consensus.

     - Create national and local records in which citizens will be tracked and
classified depending on their ideas, habits, and relationships; in this way,
censorship will be used as an instrument for the creation of a “police state”.

     - Censor any thought, expression, speech or debate that will not enforce
government ideology.

     - Such laws will be used against those who frame this document when they are
not in power.

# - It is the responsibility of Governments and bureaucracies to govern for the people

not control the people.

3. The Bill removes the right of individual Australians to express their “inherent dignity”
and exercise their intelligence, skills and competencies in determining what is
misinformation and disinformation by appointing a non independent bureaucratic
organisation, coloured by political ideology, as the sole arbiter on thought, opinion,
speech and expression online. It takes from Australian citizens their inherent and
inalienable right to read, hear and participate in legitimate debate on a great variety of
very important issues, opinions, evidence, data, religious thought, doctrines and
theology and scientific thought, research, opinion, reviews and discoveries. When it
comes to the issues that matter, citizens have the right to hear all sides of a debate
and decide for themselves. It’s not the right for the elites to undermine a citizens ability
and dictate what the Australian people are allowed to see, hear and read. It’s a breach
of international and fundamental human rights, is undemocratic and un-Australian. It
amounts to the setting up of a Government appointed ‘Ministry of Truth’ that has no
place in a democracy like Australia. It is not the responsibility of faceless bureaucrats
and fact checkers to get to decide what is true and what isn’t. We already know they
get it wrong all the time (as happened during Covid) and this Bill will make it worse.

4. The Bill threatens the foundations of our democracy by invoking a totalitarian approach
over our fundamental human rights and civil liberties. Democracy is a form of
government in which supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them
directly or indirectly through a system of representation involving periodic free
elections. ‘Misinformation’ and ‘Disinformation’ will mean whatever the government
wants it to mean, not what THE PEOPLE want. That’s why it is being called ‘Orwellian’
with references to ‘The Ministry of Truth’ which featured in the novel ‘1984’ by George
Orwell.

There is an abundance of Human rights law that has many declarations and international
conventions that underpin it. The best-known conventions are:

_and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

  - the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which covers
economic, social and cultural rights including the right to health and the right to
education

  - the Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects civil and political
rights, for example, freedom of speech and freedom from torture.

  - **_United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights_**

The 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in its preamble
declares it recognises “the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all
_members of the human family” to “foundations of freedom, justice and peace in the world”._
The proposed bill will remove those inalienable rights of Australian citizens by removing
those freedoms, justice and peace. In particular the Bill has the potential to be used to
breach the following articles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
**_Rights:_**

Article 1 - by creating inequality “in dignity and rights” of individuals.

Article 2 - by removing “rights and freedoms set forth in” the Declaration, and make
distinctions based on a person’s “religion, political or other opinion”.

Article 7 - by removing “equality before the law” and create “discrimination to equal
_protection of the law”._

Article 8 - by removing “effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts
_violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law”._

Article 10 - by creating inequality “to a fair and public hearing by an independent and
_impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal_
_charge against him”._

Article 11 - by removing the “right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty right to be
_presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial“._

Article 12 - by occasioning “attacks upon” the “honour and reputation” of contributors in
contravention of this article.

Article 18 - by removing the right of online contributors to “freedom of thought, conscience
_and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom,_
_either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or_
_belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance” guaranteed under this article._

Article 19 - by removing the “right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information_
_and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers” in contravention of this article._

Article 23 (1) - by removing from writers, commentators, authors etc the “the right to work,
_to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection_
_against unemployment” guaranteed under this article._

_and Disinformation) Bill 2023_

**Articles 29 and 30 - these articles already clearly address the concerns that this Bill may**
be attempting to address by placing responsibility on all members of the human race to act
responsibly and with respect in preserving the “rights and freedoms of others”, I.e. the
golden rule, do unto others what you would want them to do to you. Mutual accountability.

**A Warning**

Take note of what the proverb says “He/She who lives by the sword will die by the Sword”.
So ‘He/She who lives by the sword of censorship will fall by the sword of censorship’.

Your Sincerely,

David Doyle
