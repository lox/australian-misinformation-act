As a citizen of Australia believing in the democracy of the western world, I have grave concerns over government legislation
to censor free speech.
Fining tech companies for allowing their clients to question the government or hold a different view from the mainstream
narrative smacks of Big Brother.
Allowing fact checkers (Qualifications please) to take down the posts of those who disagree with opinions of others, removes
freedom of speech and thought. Australia wouldn't have become the great nation it was, if it hadn't been for those who
questioned authority, fought wars and disagreed with the powers that be.
I have watched with horror the slow removal of our individual rights over the past three years, under the guise of Health.
Breaking of the Nuremburg Code, lockdowns, mandates, etc, have reduced us to no better than Communist China, who we
are constantly being told is a threat to our freedom.
Rubbish. Our own government are more threat to us, than that of a country far away.
I view the rest of my life in Australia with trepidation, should these new laws be permitted to come into effect.
Leave freedom of speech and thought alone, before you further destroy our once (but no longer) great nation.
Yours faithfully
Rachel Bonney
Concerned citizen.
