Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam

I am writing to submit my feedback on the draft bill titled "Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023." As an Australian
citizen, I am deeply concerned and outraged by the existence of this bill, as it clearly
demonstrates a lack of respect for the freedom of speech of Australian citizens.

It is my strongly held belief that the internet is the most powerful democratic invention of
humanity, giving voice to regular people and allowing open and honest discussions.
However, this bill creates two classes of citizens: one consisting of politicians, journalists,
and members of educational institutions who will have the power to spread information,
regardless of its veracity, and the second group comprising regular citizens who are often
more knowledgeable about certain topics than those in the first category.

The imposition of excessive fines under this bill will lead to digital platforms becoming
more restrictive in terms of speech than they currently are. The industry-wide nature of the
code and the absence of "pressure escape valves" will further compound the harm caused.
It is impossible to accurately judge what is true or untrue, as new information is constantly
being discovered that can contradict widely accepted facts. This bill fails to consider this
ever-evolving nature of knowledge.

Additionally, the broad definitions of "misleading" and "deceptive" in this bill will lead to the
removal of not only provably false information but also potentially true information that may
be deemed misleading. Freedom of speech allows for open and honest discussions, even
when we are wrong, as it is through debate that we find common ground and truth.

Even experts, such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of
Australia, have raised serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. Dr.
Coatsworth's statement on Twitter clearly questions the feasibility and fairness of
implementing such legislation. If even an esteemed expert suggests the bill is likely to
result in fines for things that are not necessarily false, it raises serious doubts about the
effectiveness and intention of this legislation.

Furthermore, the reliance on industry bodies, which are often influenced by the biggest
players in the industry, creates a scenario where the proposed industry codes may
become tools for "gatekeeping" and preventing new competitors from entering the market.
This will stifle competition and innovation, benefiting only the largest digital services.

The proposed billâ€™s global extraterritorial reach is an overreach and displays a lack of
understanding of how the internet operates. Requiring compliance from foreign entities,
regardless of their knowledge of Australian laws or industry codes, is unworkable and will
only create uncertainty and potential conflicts with other countries. It is essential to
recognize the actions we condemn in other nations, such as Hong Kong, should not be
replicated in our own legislation.

I strongly believe that this bill imposes an unreasonable restriction on freedom, liberty, and
the right to freedom of speech and enterprise. The potential fines and legal risks it
introduces will limit the ability of individuals and small businesses to participate in public
discourse and operate online platforms. This goes against the principles of democracy and
freedom upon which our nation was founded.

In conclusion, I respectfully request that the Australian Government reconsider and
withdraw the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. The proposed restrictions on freedom of speech and the
potential consequences for individuals and small businesses are disproportionate and
unjustifiable. Instead, I encourage the government to seek alternative measures that
uphold the values of a free and open society while addressing concerns surrounding
misinformation and disinformation.

Thank you for considering my feedback on this important matter.

Yours sincerely,
