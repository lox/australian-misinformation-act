 and Disinformation) Bill 2023”

The proposed Bill is a attack on free speech and should be scrapped.

Free and open public discussion leads to the truth. The proposed Bill is an attempt to selectively stifle public
discussion by placing onerous requirements on digital platform services. It will add to the bureaucracy of the
country, waste public funds, divert police from solving real crimes, and waste the resources of the judiciary.  It will,
if anything, make the community less safe and therefore worse off.

The proposed Bill will incur enormous compliance costs for the digital platform services. This may lead to services
closing due to the costs or force services to charge users to recover costs which will decrease usage. Neither of
these outcomes is of benefit to the public.

The supporting information provided on the government websites and in various documents fails to demonstrate
how misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to safety, democracy, society, and the economy. It must also
be noted that the definitions of misinformation, disinformation, and harm are opaque at best and certainly open to
interpretation. So the proposed Bill must be scrapped.

There is mention of “a multitude of harms from disrupted public health responses to foreign interference in
elections and the undermining of democratic institutions” in the fact sheet yet there is no evidence show the harms.

The only harm cited in the fact sheets that is supported by known actions is the damage to some 5G infrastructure. I
see no evidence presented that those responsible for damage to the 5G infrastructure were motivated solely from
posts on digital social media. But I note that for more than 40 years there have been concerns about high-voltage
power transmission lines and concerns have been raised with mobile phones for more than 30 years, both examples
well before the rise of digital social media.

Where real harm is done by citizens we already have laws in place. For example, bashing, murder and wilful
destruction of property are all illegal. We do not need to fine and/or incarcerate people for text, images or videos
on digital social media that some arbitrary body decides are harmful. If there is misinformation then it is best
combated with the truth, not fines and imprisonment.

It is my view that digital social media has helped raise awareness of many topics and has led to the truth being made
available to many. We know that governments control messaging and have the mainstream media in their back
pockets, so we need alternative sources get information publicised. It may well be that some of this information is
false and/or misleading, but so is the information pumped out by the establishment. This Bill seeks to silence and
punish citizens whilst giving the professional media and governments a free pass.

Often it is only digital social media that provides information about the lies and mistruths propagated by the
‘professional media’, parliamentarians and government bureaucrats. Where is the Bill to hold these groups to
account for the harms caused by their actions? In recent times COVID lockdowns caused harm including delayed
childhood development, poor education outcomes, destroyed small businesses, loss of careers due to mandates and,
upheaval created by loss of sacked unvaccinated workers such as nurses, doctors, pilots, and school teachers, to
name but a few.

There is a well-documented ‘replication crisis’ regarding many areas of science. We are presented results from
climate modelling that fail with back-testing. However, we are told to follow the science and believe experts that
support the government narratives. We should get injected with inadequately tested vaccines, wear a mask, social
distance and turn off our heating and stop eating meat to save the planet. We need digital social media to highlight
issues and provide alternative viewpoints, many of which would remain unknown due to one-sided media coverage.

assured that it will be quickly balanced with opposing views.

Digital social media has been important in getting out information about proven conspiracy theories such as:

  - Lab leak of COVD-19

  - The false framing of Trump being a Russian asset

  - Biden’s corrupt influence peddling

  - The truth about Hunter Biden laptop

  - The WHO attempts to seize excess power

  - The dangers and lack of efficacy of vaccine

  - The ineffectiveness of lockdowns

I am not suggesting that there is no misinformation on digital social media, but individuals need to do their own
research. If governments are concerned about misinformation then they should provide detailed evidence that
supports the truth and not attack those that push back. It is wrong to coerce the digital platform service providers,
and anyone else, into silence with fines and imprisonment.

The governments' ‘ACMA misinformation report Fact sheet 1: key research findings are short on facts but provide us
with what we must consider to be misinformation. The fact sheet states: "There was considerable overlap and
increasing convergence between narratives, with many posts sharing a mix of anti-lockdown, anti-vaccine, anti-5G
and QAnon sentiment." So let’s review these items.

1. We now know from the release of numerous reports that the lockdowns were ineffective. Also, we know

that Sweden’s no lockdown strategy has been shown to be correct. The real impact of the lockdowns were:

    - crushing impact on the economy, particularly small business,

    - ridiculous overspending by governments of borrowed money

    - harm to the development of children through school closures and remote learning

    - unnecessary separation of families from loved ones

    - financial burdens placed on people locked out of their state

2. The vaccine used initially in Australia was pulled from the market in Australia and the UK

because of side effects. The vaccine was withdrawn from the market also because of

side effects. employees in Australia were administered special batches. So how can people

expressing scepticism regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines be seen as disinformation? My personal
experience with the vaccine is ongoing tinnitus and an aching injection site for more than a year. And I

must also add that every person I know that received a vaccine also got COVID-19. We also are now
experiencing unprecedented levels of all cause deaths which just happen to coincide with the introduction of
COVID-19 vaccinations.

3. Regarding 5G the jury is still out. There have been concerns about EMR (electro-magnetic radiation) for

decades, well preceding the advent of digital social media. Is there evidence that the damage to 5G
infrastructure was caused by otherwise ignorant actors that read about the issue on social media? Also,
there are ongoing studies that are so far inconclusive, but the fact that they are being done shows there is an
ongoing legitimate concern with EMR, including 5G. It is good to have people voicing opinions on both sides
of the argument.

4. I am not sure what is meant by QAnon but I guess it pertains to the 2020 US presidential election where

there is still considerable doubt about the result. I note however that the 2016 election result was widely
disputed by Democrats including Hillary Clinton. There is no doubt that there was election interference but I
do not know whether it affected the result We do know that a survey of Democrats showed that 19% would

misinformation’. As we know the laptop reported for years as a ‘conspiracy theory’ until recently where
there is now widespread acknowledgement of its authenticity. As we know, this misinformation (the laptop
is fake) was peddled by the professional media and the Democrats and the crimes it exposed so far not
properly pursued by the FBI, IRS and DOJ.

So in summary, all 4 examples cited as misinformation are certainly mischaracterisations. For people and companies
to be penalised for expressing concern in any of these examples is a step towards totalitarianism. This Bill is an
attempt to end public debate by coercing citizens into silence. It is an attack on free speech. It will add to the
bureaucracy of the country and be a waste of funds. It will also lead to a further erosion of confidence and must not
be allowed to proceed.

The outrageous penalties in the proposed draft are clearly designed to frighten people into silence.

Regarding definitions, misinformation can be “Misinformation about a group of Australians inciting other persons to
commit hate crimes against that group”. And yet the ABC report that “Only 21 people have ever been convicted of a
hate crime in Australia.” They further report that “Victorian police flagged 4,257 incidents during a four-year period
as being linked to prejudice.”, which implies that thousands of people have been investigated by police over nothing.

Until such time that we see genuine harm that cannot be prosecuted under existing laws, there is no need for this
new Bill. The government “Guidance note” states “The misinformation falsely claims that specific community groups
in Australia are responsible for a range of social issues. The misinformation seeks to undermine social cohesion and
foster hatred towards certain groups in Australian society” but provides no known cases.

There are numerous claims of harm but where is the hard evidence? The public is entitled to details such as names,
dates, places, details of harm, etc before agreeing to this new Bill.

There are real examples of misinformation such as the “weapons of mass destruction”. Were any of our bureaucrats
that peddled this misinformation held to account? Certainly none that I am aware of. Instead this misinformation
resulted in millions of dollars of taxpayer funds spent funding a war, death and misery for the citizens of Iraq and
Afghanistan, and Australian soldiers killed, maimed or left suffering from the horrors of war.

We are constantly told about the threats of terror and yet see no evidence of its existence. However, we are
inconvenienced when we travel and pay more to be protected from this never seen threat. It seems what we really
need to fear is government misinformation.

We are told by the ‘professional media’ (that are exempt from these new regulations) about right-wing extremists
and neo-Nazis at rallies, yet when I have marched I see concerned citizens peacefully congregating to listen to
speakers. I do not agree with every word uttered by the speakers but I welcome the chance to hear them express
their views.

It seems that the “A report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms’ disinformation and news quality
measures” is part of the justification for this Bill. However, the report uses a survey where agreeing that ‘wearing a
mask does not significantly reduce your risk of infection or spreading the virus’ proves the person is a victim of
misinformation. In the meantime, many studies have proven that mask wearing is an ineffective measure, proving
the ‘conspiracy theorists’ correct. We know that N95 masks may provide some benefit if worn correctly and
**changed frequently.**

There are many ‘conspiracy theories’ that have proven correct. We have ivermectin, that was once labelled by the
media and others as “horse paste”, now acknowledged by the FDA as effective in the treatment of COVID-19. We
know that COVID-19 most likely did leak from a bio-lab in Wuhan. We know that COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective
and dangerous despite utterances to the contrary by Bill Gates Fauci and numerous medical experts and scientists

‘professional media’, the politicians and government officials who remain largely silent as facts emerge.

I am not suggesting that there is no misinformation on social media, but individuals need to do their own research.
If governments are concerned about misinformation then they should provide detailed evidence and not anecdotes
and platitudes such as ‘trust the science’ where such science is cherry-picked to support the government narrative.
The collapse of support for government officials is justified.

Governments have not earned the trust of citizens with their broken election promises, unpunished corruption,
wasteful spending and misinformation. I am more likely to support a Bill that will hold politicians and government
officials to account with loss of pension benefits, meaningful fines and/or incarceration for proven misconduct. It is
not enough for these people to resign in disgrace or resign due to health or family matters, rather than face real
consequences. This is more likely to restore faith in our politicians and senior government bureaucrats.

Unfortunately the corruption of the police and the judiciary with political appointments has shown that we now
have two tiers of justice. This is evidenced by the unprecedented level of resignations from Victoria Police in 2022.

The government should welcome ‘conspiracy theories’ emerging on social media as it gives them a good reason to
present their views.

This Bill is another step on the road to totalitarianism. Proceeding with the Bill will further undermine the confidence
in governments and the law.
