# I do not agree that the Australian Government should introduce new laws that give the Australian Communications and Media Authority new powers to combat disinformation and misinformation on digital platform services or on any platform whatsoever. I do not think there can be a fair balance between an independent regulator, deciding for Australians what they think constitutes misinformation or disinformation, and have freedom of speech. I think Australians should be able to have access to any, and all, information and decide for themselves what they consider to be the truth or not. I don’t agree that we need to turn Australia into a ‘nanny state’ where people are not able to think for themselves.
