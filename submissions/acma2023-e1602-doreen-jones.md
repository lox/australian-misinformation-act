**Submission**

I am submitting my view on the new ACMA powers to Combat Misinformation and Disinformation Bill.

I believe this to be government overreach in respect to our freedom of speech and freedom of expression.

We shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. We shall have the right to freedom of expression which includes the freedom to
seek, receive and impart information, ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing, in print, in forms of art or through any other
media of choice.

As Australian citizens, we should have the right to be able to hear and discern for ourselves what is misinformation and disinformation.

For what purpose is this bill other than bureaucrats controlling our freedom of expression and making more money from fines or threatening fines.

This bill is a threat to our democracy, and our society as a whole.

We do not need another law or more power given to the AMCA. This is government overreach.

Regards

Doreen Jones
