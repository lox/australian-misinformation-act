The “Misinformation Bill” must be rejected.

I wish to state a very strong concern regarding the apparent looming loss of my Freedom of speech which is the bedrock of our
current Australian free and fair society. It is a fundamental value. It is very evident that, Despite denials to the contrary, the
proposed bill will erode this fundamental human right.

Freedom of speech is essential in attempting to discover truth, and finding an appropriate balance, for all parties involved. The
whole process of discovery relies on free-flowing information that can be tested and questioned. Let us show wisdom and learn
from History, which repeatedly demonstrates that many instances when society or the government of the day has held to a
position or scientific idea, only to have it thrown out years later. The proposed bill will effectively halt this essential dialogue.

The internet has become the ‘town square’ where the latest ideas can be debated. Now people can send factual information
around the world in an instant, as well as spread false ideas. There are positives and negatives to modern technology. But setting
up the government as the arbiter of truth is not the answer. It also begs the question who is the government’s arbiter? I was
taught that our Government represents the people and is not not a self-appointed., autocracy.

The proposed bill would do incredible damage and must be thrown out.
