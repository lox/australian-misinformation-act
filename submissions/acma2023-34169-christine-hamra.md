My submission can be made public.

I do not agree or consent to the misinformation bill, it is an attack on the fundamental principles of democracy and
another step forward in removing free speech. Australians should have the right to decide for themselves what they
believe, as opposed to having our beliefs dictated to us by the government. Government, mainstream media and
educational institutions will be exempt and able to spread false information with no accountability. This bill should
not pass.

If this bill had already passed, I would not be able to voice my opinion on this topic and you would not be viewing
this post. This bill should not pass.
