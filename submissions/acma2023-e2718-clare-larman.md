To Whom It May Concern,

I wish to express my concern regarding the Australian Government’s Draft Bill
‘combatting Misinformation and Disinformation’.

We as Australians, have enjoyed lives free of dictatorship, with our voices and
opinions robustly and respectfully debated over many, many years. We have
prided ourselves on having a democratic society, encouraging tolerance and
empathy, while also acknowledging difference. This mindset has always been
paramount in our country. Indeed, our shores have been a haven for those
escaping dictatorial regimes whose freedoms to think, speak and act as free
citizens have been denied.
This right to think freely and express ourselves within a broad minded society is
absolutely critical to the health of our country. Having an opportunity to ask
questions, to cultivate critical, creative and analytical thinking and coexist within
that society encompassing a wide range of beliefs and values is paramount to the
future of this wonderful country and its peoples.
This Amendment to Communications Bill is nothing short of crazy. It is narrow
minded, goes against all we, as a Nation enjoy, and limits our capacity as a
forward thinking country to stand proudly on the world stage.

I am baffled as to who would be the ones making the decisions as to what is
‘acceptable’ and what is not.
Who elects these people, these arbiters of ‘truth’?
What qualifications do they have to speak on behalf of a Nation?
What credentials do they have – or how can one actually say what credentials
could possibly be ‘right’?
Critically, who has any rights to my thoughts?

I sincerely hope this never gets any airtime as it is a crime against our rights as
Australian citizens as far as I am concerned, and I am actually appalled that
unelected, unidentified bureaucrats should even consider this as an option in
this wonderful country and I would be ashamed to call myself Australian should
this go through.
The loss to many sectors ie: the Arts, Sport, Health, Education and many more
would be disastrous and would stunt any further growth as an evolving country.
It is simply wrong. I do NOT support this Bill going through.
