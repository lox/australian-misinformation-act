Comments on Proposed New ACMA Laws to Combat Misinformation and Disinformation.

I am a private citizen, born and raised in Australia. I have post-tertiary qualifications and consider
myself to be well-informed and reasonably intelligent. I have never before been involved in any
protest movements and have been prepared to accept a range of what I considered to be poorlythought-out laws and rules because, on balance, I felt able to “live with” the consequences of said
laws and rules. I have never had any interaction with law enforcement agencies and have worked
long and hard for many years. I firmly believe in the notion that, provided no harm is done, then the
government has no business telling anyone what they may or may not do. I also firmly believe it is
my right to say what I think based on consideration of the pro and con arguments and the available
empiric data, on any particular topic. This is free speech.
I cannot, however, allow the proposed new Misinformation and Disinformation Laws to pass without
comment. This proposal is absolutely appalling. How dare the Government, or its agency (ACMA)
determine what information I am to be allowed to see? History has shown, many times over, that
today’s truth is tomorrow’s falsehood. I, and the vast majority of Australians, are intelligent enough
to make our OWN decisions about the veracity or otherwise of material. And to allow the
government of the day to be exempt from the laws is obscene.
There is just too much subjectivity in the interpretation of the proposed laws. What is Harm? What is
Misinformation? The potential for the Law to allow a government to disallow any opposing thought
is immense.
It is also disingenuous to say that ACMA will not have the power to act on specific pieces on
whatever platform they appear, when it is still up to ACMA to determine what is and is not
permitted. The various digital platforms will more than likely err on the side of caution, potentially
disallowing even more items, because of the fines involved.
In short, the proposed Laws are an appalling assault on free speech in this country and have the
potential to muzzle all thought that is different to the perceived wisdom of those who shout most
stridently about a particular topic. They should not be altered, modified or changed at all. They
should be immediately thrown away, never to be considered again.
I quietly wonder is this submission sufficient to have me on some kind of Blacklist should the
proposed legislation be passed.
