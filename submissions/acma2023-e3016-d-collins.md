Australia Says No to Censorship.

This Bill is in breach of our international treaty obligations, specifically Article 19 on the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.

2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to

seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either

orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

This attempt at censorship is a betrayal to the entire history, culture, and values, of the Australian
people.

Mis-information and Dis-information has always existed, and do not pose a threat to our democracy

– enforced views and censorship do. No one has the perfect truth – debate and free access to ideas,

data and opinion are our only substitute. This has been established throughout history – and is

already fundamental to our constitution, history and culture.

Never in our history has there been a need for government censorship, and there certainly is not
now.

Freedom of speech is an inalienable right. Never in history have the censors been the good guys.

If there is a threat to we, the Australian people, it is not from the continuing free and open

discussion we have always enjoyed – it is from puppets who sit in government.

If you cannot trust People to have their Liberty, then you cannot trust the people who want Power

over them.

WHO 'FACT-CHECKS' THE 'FACT-CHECKERS'?

WHO ARE THE CENSORS?

Freedom is not anxiety-free – but it is always better than the alternative.

This bill must be rejected in strongest terms.

D Collins
