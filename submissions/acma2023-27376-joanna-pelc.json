    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The bill does not appropriately balance freedom of expression with the protection against misinformation.",
      "The definition of 'misinformation' is problematic as it includes information that is false but not intended to mislead.",
      "There is a danger in allowing an entity to determine what constitutes misinformation, which could lead to harm.",
      "The bill could lead to censorship and is reminiscent of legislation in totalitarian regimes.",
      "Existing laws already address the misuse of free speech, making the new bill unnecessary.",
      "The bill introduces a new category of restricted speech conflating free speech with government-opposed speech.",
      "The exemption of media and government from the bill is problematic and could lead to misuse."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [
      "Freedom of Speech",
      "Definition and Determination of Misinformation",
      "Censorship Concerns",
      "Existing Legal Framework",
      "Government and Media Exemptions"
    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The proposed Bill suffers from a serious flaw, in that, who decides that a piece of information is ‘misinformation’?",
      "It is extremely dangerous to curtail such expression and allocating an entity the right to deem what is ‘misinformation’ can only result in harm to the public.",
      "The proposed Bill, in effect, introduces an entirely new category of restricted speech, where free speech is conflated with government-opposed speech to facilitate a new category of ‘misinformation’ and, as such, justify censorship.",
      "The other issue with the proposed Bill is the exemption of media and the government."
