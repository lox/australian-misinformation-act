**Feedb%ck Response to**
**Communic%tions Legisl%tion Amendment (Comb%tting Misinform%tion %nd**
**Disinform%tion) Bill 2023**
To Whom it m)y concern,
I do not )gree th)t we, the people of Austr)li) need the Austr)li)n Government
to decide wh)t is best for us. We )re intelligent enough to discern )nd ev)lu)te
inform)tion )nd decide wh)t is best for ourselves.
Given th)t Austr)li) is ) diverse multicultur)l n)tion, It should then be
expected th)t we will )lw)ys h)ve different points of view within our
community )nd therefore require )venues of open communic)tion th)t )llows
free speech )nd freedom of expression.
To suppress people )nd not )llow them to h)ve ) voice is not ) solution to
resolving )ny soci)l issues. It would only further divide )nd )ggr)v)te people.
It would encour)ge the m)nifest)tion
of ) mono-culture, cre)ting ) soci)l environment th)t will h)rbour m)ny
neg)tive repercussions

A very concerning problem th)t this Bill would cre)te is the issue of who
decides wh)t is misinform)tion in its most specific form on beh)lf of the entire
n)tion. How could this be )chieved?
Does this governing body )lso h)ve )ccount)bility. Is The ACMA )nd this
legisl)tion subject to extern)l review to ensure it is not going to become )
suppressive dr)coni)n presence within our community, c)tering to cert)in
influenti)l powers )t the expense of other sectors of community.
This Bill if en)bled h)s the potenti)l to be h)rmful to Austr)li)n society if there
w)s no option for it to be disc)rded thru ) just process of )ppe)l )ccessible to
everyone including the sm)llest minority groups within our popul)tion.

This Bill h)s ) potenti)l to be h)rmful to our community )s it h)s written into
its function)lity the )bility to silence public response vi) its powers to shut
down inform)tion bro)dc)st.
So therefore once it is en)cted it could be used to suppress )ny individu)l or
groups right to protest or express their point of view..
A he)lthy society should include )venues for people to be )llowed to express
differing points of view.

More inform)tion is required in some )re)s of the outline of this Bill p)rticul)rly
in reg)rds to specific guidelines )nd definitions of industry st)nd)rds )nd wh)t
would be considered inform)tion th)t c)uses serious h)rm, in p)rticul)r how
## )nd )t wh)t c)p)city it )ffects ) signific)nt portion of the Austr)li)n
popul)tion, the economy or the environment, or undermines the integrity of )n
Austr)li)n democr)tic process.
Also how is this resolve )ctu)lly )scert)ined: i.e th)t specific inform)tion is the
c)use of ) specific h)rm?


-----

This expl)n)tion needs to include det)ils of the specific )uthorit)tive he)d of
power th)t would empower this )ction )nd justific)tion of the processes th)t
)re being proposed.
There should be more expl)n)tion of involvement of )ny judici)l processes or
leg)l fr)mework th)t should provide ) f)ir )nd democr)tic process in line with
our democr)tic societ)l v)lues, This should be outlined in ) w)y th)t the
gener)l public c)n underst)nd )nd feel re)ssured they will not be unf)irly
t)rgeted.

**Further comments :**
**In reg%rd to the following st%tements:**

**P%ge 2 of the f%ct sheet which st%tes**
**“the ACMA will not h%ve the power to request specific content or posts be**
**removed from digit%l pl%tform services”**
This st)tement is confusing )nd contr)dictory. This power does )ctu)lly
)ppe)r to be present in the form of coercion. Whereby if you consider the l)rge
fin)nci)l costs in the form of fines, infringements imposed )nd the possibility
of this even le)ding to crimin)l ch)rges for the )lleged perpetr)tor.

**P%ge 2: F%ct sheet:**
**_“rules m)de under the Bill m)y require digit)l pl)tform services to h)ve_**
**_systems )nd processes in pl)ce to )ddress misinform)tion or_**
**_disinform)tion th)t meets ) threshold of being likely to c)use or_**
**_contribute to serious h)rm”_**
How c)n this be decided in e)ch specific inst)nce )nd by whom ? The
definitions of misinform)tion )nd disinform)tion )re not cle)rly formul)ted )nd
too bro)d )nd open ended.

**P%ge 2: F%ct sheet:**
**_“the code )nd st)nd)rd-m)king powers will not )pply to )uthorised_**
**_elector)l )nd referendum content )nd other types of content such )s_**
**_profession)l news )nd s)tire”_**
This h)s ) potenti)l for discrimin)tion )nd corruption. Who decides
"profession)l" from "non-profession)l". Bro)dc)st of inform)tion could then
only come from "selected" sources th)t )lign with cert)in influences. Wh)t
influences the decision in selecting these “profession)l” services. I do not w)nt
someone else deciding wh)t inform)tion should be )ccessible on my beh)lf
)nd therefore t)king )w)y my freedom of choice.
For us to ev)lu)te soci)l issues we need to )llow freedom of speech )nd open
deb)te th)t includes ) b)l)nce of diverse points of view. The st)tement )bove
from p)ge 2 of the f)ct sheet would h)ve the potenti)l of providing ) bi)sed
)nd skewed deb)te with possible tendency to be suppressive.

**P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:**
# Why these powers )re needed
**_“Misinform)tion )nd disinform)tion spre)d vi) digit)l pl)tform services is_**
**_) m)jor issue worldwide.”_**
This st)tement is subjective )nd requires further cl)rific)tion )nd evidence to
b)ck it up. There needs to be ) democr)tic, non-bi)sed )nd more re)son)ble
definition of misinform)tion )nd disinform)tion. The definitions referred to in
this document)tion )ppe)r uncle)r )nd therefore h)ve potenti)l to become
bi)sed )nd skewed )nd ) me)ns of soci)l control.

**P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:**
**_“r)pid spre)d of f)lse, misle)ding )nd deceptive inform)tion online h)s_**
**_resulted in ) multitude of h)rms_**
**_from disrupted public he)lth responses to foreign interference in_**
**_elections )nd the undermining of_**
**_democr)tic institutions.”_**
This is not ) result of the citizens being h)rmed by misinform)tion but more
the result of ) l)ck of good govern)nce vi) the government itself. This )ttitude
only serves to displ)ce )ccount)bility )w)y from the c)use )nd distr)cts from
)ny concentr)ted effort to focus on resolving wh)t m)y be the true c)use of
the disruptions.

**P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:Misinform%tion is: “content dissemin)ted using )**
**_digit)l service th)t is f)lse, misle)ding or deceptive; )nd”_**
Given the subjective n)ture of "inform)tion" )nd in respect to the specifics of
the m)ny subjects )nd contexts th)t this concept could encomp)ss - How
could this definition of wh)t is true or f)lse possibly be s)tisf)ctorily )chieved
for e)ch individu)l )cross )ll possible scen)rios. However there )re definite
f)cts such )s 1+1=2. But then there )re other )pp)rent f)cts found within )n
individu)ls met)physic)l or ideologic)l perspective which )re more subjective,
psychologic)l concepts which veer more tow)rd individu)l choice.

**P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:**
**”the provision of the content on the digit%l service is re%son%bly likely to**
**c%use or contribute to serious h%rm; %nd “**
Re)son)bly likely? This st)tement is open ended )nd undefined. It is
disconcerting to contempl)te th)t it would be considered terms in which to
t)rget )nd pen)lise )n individu)l or group? who decides )nd by wh)t judici)l
process is this conclusion )rrived ?

**The following from P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:**
**_“the content is not excluded for misinform)tion purposes, with th)t_**
**_content being:_**

**_•_**
**_content produced in good f)ith for the purposes of entert)inment, p)rody_**

**_or s)tire_**

**_•_**
**_profession)l news content_**

**_•_**
**_content )uthorised by the Austr)li)n or ), St)te, Territory or Loc)l_**

**_content produced by or for )n )ccredited educ)tion provider._**
**_NOTE: Content m)de in response to the )bove excluded types of content_**
**_is not )utom)tic)lly )lso_**
**_excluded for misinform)tion purposes (i.e. comments on ) profession)l_**
**_news )rticle).”_**
This is not cle)r, b)dly expl)ined )nd not e)sy to underst)nd. More rel)t)ble
)nd underst)nd)ble inform)tion needs to be provided to the public. It )lmost
seems like it is intended to be confusing.

**P%ge 3: F%ct sheet:**
**_“the content is dissemin)ted with intent to deceive, including through_**
**_)utom)ted processes )nd_**
**_foreign interference. This c)ptures content th)t is purposefully or_**
**_m)liciously dissemin)ted_**
**_disinform)tion.”_**
Does this include cyber crime, h)cking? which the government )nd corpor)te
entities h)ve previously demonstr)ted th)t they )re un)ble to successfully
provide protection )g)inst. How is this Bill going to cre)te th)t protection th)t
h)s not previously been effectively provided? There h)s been m)ny d)t)
bre)ches in the p)st few ye)rs )nd some being on Government dep)rtments
themselves including sever)l d)t) bre)ch incidents by the very dep)rtment
th)t is me)nt to protect its citizens from cyber crime, The Dep)rtment of Home
Aff)irs.

This h)s the potenti)l for inv)sive over re)ch )nd bre)ch of priv)cy. How c)n
we be sure this is not going to become intrusive )nd suppressive.

**P%ge 6 F%ct sheet:**
**_“The ACMA m)y )lso obt)in inform)tion from other persons to )ssist the_**

**_will be required to consult with_**


-----

**_imp)cted digit)l pl)tform service providers prior to publishing )ny_**

Both of these st)tements )ppe)r to contr)dict previous st)tements m)de
pert)ining to priv)cy )nd extent of the ACMAʼs powers. This )dds to the
inconclusive )nd undefined l)ck of cl)rity th)t )ppe)rs to be evident in this
Bill. This would be )n extremely inv)sive power to )llow the ACMA. There is no
limit)tion to how f)r the investig)tion c)n extend under this power )nd
therefore will involve people who h)ve not committed )ny offence to h)ve there
pe)ceful existence disrupted.
This document)tion is not subst)nti)l nor re)son)ble to inform the public of
proposed Bill.

These )re outr)geously l)rge pen)lties. The )mounts of money do not
correl)te to the crime )nd )lso )re disproportion)te in contr)st with pen)lties
for more serious crimes.
How is this the government protecting people ? It seems like the opposite.

**_Austr)li)ns from serious h)rm th)t_**
**_c)n come from the spre)d of misinform)tion )nd disinform)tion.”_**
Why does the government )ssume the role to impose itself under the guise of
)pp)rently upholding the rights )nd freedoms of Austr)li)ns. Austr)li)ns do
not need to be protected from inform)tion, we )re not stupid )nd require the
freedom to choose wh)t inform)tion we would like to )ccess )s you would
expect in ) free )nd democr)tic society.

This st)tement signifies )n intention of non disclosure. It )ppe)rs to indic)te
)n )void)nce to define who decides truthfulness )nd how this conclusion
would be surmised. Truthfulness is required to be defined in order to f)cilit)te
the procedures outlined within the Bill )nd in the principle underpinning
st)tements such )s:

**"Misinform%tion is online content th%t is f%lse,..."**
In order to surmise th)t it is f)lse you would h)ve to h)ve defined truth.
Definition )nd det)ils of the procedures involved need to be provided here. The
use of displ)cement is evident through the conce)led referr)l of the role of
defining truth. Is there )n )lloc)ted dep)rtment of truth not mentioned here?
Where is the he)d of power th)t provides the )uthority to decide wh)t is f)lse?
