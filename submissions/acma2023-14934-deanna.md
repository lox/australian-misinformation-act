Submission for proposed New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation
Freedom of speech is paramount to every living man and woman’s independence and freedom. We have seen over the last three years
heavy censorship on facebook, YouTube and other social media platforms with people sharing posts about the safety and efficacy of covid
vaccines. Posts that were against the government’s narrative and yet, much of what was shared has now been proven correct.
It is not the government, or any other organisation/department/NGO’s job to censor information. It is up to each person’s discernment to
research on their own, what information is correct and what information is false and make a decision based off this.
This legislation is yet another instance of government overreach. It is high time the government got out of our lives and let us live in peace.
Australia is one of the most highly regulated countries in the world. This country has gone severely downhill in living standards over the past
twenty years because the government keeps sticking its nose in business that is not theirs.
In summary, I oppose this proposed legislation and any legislation that tries to limit our liberty any further.
