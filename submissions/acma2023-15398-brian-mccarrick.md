These changes will stifle free speech. The Bill talks about the issues of misinformation and
disinformation which have been around since “The world is flat”.

Conspiracy theorists have always been vocal whether on the soap box or in the letters to editors
in the local newspaper but Governments have never sort to silence them. The public listened to
their views and made up their own minds on the misinformation / disinformation.

This Bill is seemingly trying to belittle the intelligence of the general public to make decisions for
themselves – a further progression into the “Nanny State”.

I believe the Bill has come to pass from the recent supposedly misinformation / disinformation
in relation to the recent Covid pandemic. I listened to all the Government information and the
alternative information including an opposing view from one of my own children and made the
then “informed decision – my choice” to receive the Astra Zeneca vaccine twice. Admittedly, I
didn’t rush out immediately but waited almost 18 months before being vaccinated – as I said my
choice.

Earlier this year information has come to light about the efficacy of the vaccine and those
championing same. The postings on social media at the time were labelled misinformation /
disinformation by the Government – something they believed in. Those expressing alternative
views also strongly believed in their views.

Just as the “world is flat” people strongly believed in their views at the time - The Government
believed in their position at the time. When the world was proven not to be flat no shut down
those who championed the world is not flat views and no one was silenced for their views.

Now the Government has been proved wrong with their views on vaccines it would appear they
are wanting to now stop alternative views by penalizing anyone who doesn’t hold the same
view.

The big problem is who decides – only those who agree with the government will decide as they
will be Government employees and their job may well depend on their views.

THIS IS NOT FREE SPEECH. If the misinformation / disinformation is from conspiracy theorists
then it will fade away.

I like every other Australian am capable of making my own decision after hearing all the
information – whether that be misinformation or disinformation it is MY choice to decide on
how I will conduct my actions from the information I deem to be relevant.

I am Strongly Opposed to the removal of Free Speech by this Bill.
