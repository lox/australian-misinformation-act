To whom this may concern,
My name is Jerome. I am a student in my ’s from . I would like to raise significant concerns about the
Albanese Government’s planned Combating Misinformation and Disformation Bill. It has been brought to my
attention that this Bill, if legislated, would allow the government to define what truth is and the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and online platforms, such as META, YouTube, Facebook,
Instagram, Google and Netflix, the powers to enforce it. The government and mainstream media would, however,
be exempt from the rules of this bill.

The Albanese Government is, essentially, legislating to stop what it deems to be “misinformation” (false information)
or “disinformation” (deliberately false information). The Bill will give the sitting government of the day the power to
silence religious and political speech that contradicts prevailing ideologies and political messaging, whatever it
arbitrarily deems to “cause harm.” The proposal fails to state what mechanisms will be included to ensure that valid
expression of opinion and belief are protected. The powers in this Bill would allow tech companies to censor what
the government perceives as problematic speech and impose significant penalties to online service providers. The
measures proposed in this Bill are a direct contradiction to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which state:

_"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions_
_without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and_
_regardless of frontiers."_

Indeed, this proposal has been rightly criticised by the Australian Human Rights Commission, quote, “There is a
_real risk that efforts to combat online misinformation and disinformation by foreign-actors could be used to_
_legitimise attempts to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and enforce ideological conformity_
_in Australia."_

This Bill would impose some of the most draconian controls to free speech in the Western world. It is a deliberate
attack on Australian's freedom of speech, showcasing a move of overwhelming government overreach that does not
align with the values that has made this country such a success on the world stage.
