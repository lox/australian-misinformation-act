    "Notable Quotes": [
      "I am disappointed that the Minister is committing time and resources to the perceived problem of 'misinformation and disinformation' when the issue of the harms of pornography has languished under this government.",
      "The proposal would prevent freedom of opinion and expression because, unlike editorial policies of individual platforms, it would apply a country wide restriction on what could and could not be said.",
      "The government seems comfortable to legislate no upper bound to the penalty, and I find it to be a cynical and greedy grab for profits which are not rightfully theirs."
