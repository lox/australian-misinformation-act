**combat** **misinformation** **and** **disinformation**

Feminist Legal Clinic Inc. is a community legal service established to advance the
human rights of women and girls. We are also the Australian country contact for
Women’s Declaration International.

The definitions in the draft Bill are both prolix and unclear. It seems the only
difference between the two definitions is that ‘disinformation’ requires an intent to
deceive in addition to the other elements. But there is no indication of the process and
criteria to be applied in determining what constitutes either misinformation or
disinformation. Who will be the arbiters of truth?

False, misleading or deceptive conduct that occurs in the course of trade or commerce
is already unlawful under Australian Consumer Law. If anything, this proposed
legislation detracts from the extent of that protection, since it is defined in a manner
that is subject to extensive exclusions. For example, false, misleading or deceptive
conduct by way of email or by a ‘media _sharing_ _service_ _that_ _does_ _not_ _have_ _an_
_interactivefeature_ _’_ is not captured by these provisions. Surely fraudulent messaging
should be captured regardless of the mode of communication used?

Furthermore, it seems that mainstream entertainment and news content as well as
information disseminated by educational institutions and government are all excluded
from the reach of this proposed legislation. In effect, this is legislation squarely
aimed at alternative sources of news and information and as such would seem to be
politically motivated. This legislation ensures government and corporations with
control of major media outlets are not only free to mislead and deceive but are also
empowered to effectively shut down all dissent.

Another element of the definitions is that it must be _'’’’reasonably_ _likely_ _to_ _cause_ _or_
_contribute_ _to_ _serious_ _harm”._ _'Serious_ _harm_ _’_ is not defined and may be difficult to
either establish or disprove. _'Harm"_ is defined in the proposed Bill’s Exposure Draft,
but the criteria for assessment of both misinformation and disinformation is _'serious_
_harm_ ’. Clearly it is a matter of degree, but how is the relevant level of ‘seriousness’

to be determined? Some claim their hurt feelings are a serious harm when another
fails to use their preferred pronouns. Meanwhile, widespread and systemic abuse of
women’s rights through the publication of violent and under-age pornography is
routinely overlooked by both social media corporations and government regulators.

Further, the Exposure Draft defines _'harm'_ as, among other things          -

_'hatred_ _against_ _a_ _group_ _in_ _Australian_ _society_ _on_ _the_ _basis_ _of_ _ethnicity,_ _nationality,_
_race,_ _gender,_ _sexual_ _orientation,_ _age,_ _religion_ _or_ _physical_ _or_ _mental_ _disability'._

Harms visited upon women and girls on the basis of their sex via so-called
misinformation and disinformation are not considered worthy of legislative
consideration. ‘Sex’ is not a protected attribute in the proposed Bill, in the same way
that it is increasingly overlooked, or rendered inferior to ‘gender identity’ in the
operation of anti-discrimination laws and policies of several Australian jurisdictions.

The draft legislation is not only unnecessarily repetitious and torturous to read but
holds little promise to do anything other than ordain arbitrary censorship of social
media and alternative news content. It would be preferable to see conscientious
application of existing laws, rather than the introduction of further complex legislation
which ultimately relies on the industry to self-regulate. Such provisions risk being
applied by corporations to unreasonably constrain freedom of expression in a manner
motivated by commercial or ideological considerations rather than protection of the
vulnerable from unscrupulous operators.

Having seen how mainstream media has been used to saturate society with gender
ideology so that no one now dares question the mantra that ‘transwomen are women’
or the fallacy of sex change, it is chilling to consider how this legislation may be
misused to further silence dissent expressed on alternative media platforms. Please do
not take this next step towards an Orwellian dystopia.

Yours faithfully
