_l object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation_
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023._

_The proposed bill undermines freedom of speech by attempting to ‘balance’ that_
_fundamental right with the notion of combating so-called ‘misinformation’._
_Fundamental rights cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are undermined._

_Determining what qualifies as so-called ‘misinformation’ is subjective and entrusting a_
_government agency to decide truthfulness raises concerns._

_So-called ‘misinformation’, unless it incites violence, does not cause direct harm, and_
_defining harm based on subjective criteria is problematic._

_The bill grants excessive control to authorities and will lead to censorship, which_
_undermines our democracy. You can’t have a democracy without free speech._

_Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of_
_speech._
