**Who is going to decide what is Misinformation and Disinformation ?**

There has been, and is, massive corruption in almost all areas of government and public
administration in Australia. It seems like almost every night Australians are being confronted
with an expose about corruption, either in the government, a government agency, or in a big
business of some kind. The individuals and organisations concerned have been able to
perpetuate their fraud because they have been allowed to police themselves through
originating their own laws and rules that have then assisted them to remain unanswerable to
any outside authority.

No government agency or authority should be given complete discretion to make the decision
as to whether they consider presented information to be misinformation or disinformation.
Giving one agency or authority overweening power to make its own rules and regulations has
been proven to encourage corruption on a massive scale, and aid everyone involved to be
protected from responsibility, accountability and transparency, to the detriment of Australia
and its people.

Freedom of speech through all and any media/s that an individual chooses to use to express
themselves should be an inherent right of every citizen, not only in Australia, but in every
nation of the world. Every individual in Australia should be encouraged to seek out any and
all information that is available to them, whether it is for or against an issue, allowing them to
base their decisions on the broadest range of research materials that they are able to access.
It should be every individualâ€™s inalienable right to make up their own mind and to confer
their own point of view without repercussions or consequences.

**The ACMA bill to Combat Misinformation and Disinformation should not be**
**considered. Do not allow this travesty against freedom of speech to go ahead.**

No person, organisation, or department, (government or private), should have the sole right to
police what is considered misinformation or disinformation for the citizenry of Australia.
That decision should be made by every individual Australian for themselves.

**Do not allow this bill to happen.**

Thank you.
