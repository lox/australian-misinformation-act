Submission re: draft of Combafting Misinformafion and Disinformafion Bill

I am an Australian cifizen who is alarmed by the draft of Combafting Misinformafion and
Disinformafion Bill, which effecfively reduces the freedom of speech on which our nafion has been
based. Aggressive and somefimes volafile but never violent discussion and disagreement has led to
new understanding and somefimes acceptance of another person’s view and beliefs, this is healthy
way for people of differing views to come to understand each other.

The draft legislafion is about controlling disinformafion and misinformafion, if one is to truly know
what these are there must be a definifion of these words as well as the words informafion and truth.

The definition of misinformation according to the oxford dictionary is

_[‘False or inaccurate information, especially that which is deliberately intended to deceive’.](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AB5stBhyErzXOfIv0n8NYU8slf-HvQ1mqg:1689034017553&q=inaccurate&si=ACFMAn9-5A9OMKPWcg180I9o9MndlKKAExTJ9WgNKEKJ1a_j8yhi9WzXNC935oLChgbdyyou7Huu6P9qnPwZawQ7YREdBrFDdA%3D%3D&expnd=1)_

The definition of disinformation based on the oxford dictionary is

_‘false informafion which is intended to mislead, especially propaganda issued by a_
_government organizafion to a rival power or the media’._

The definifion of informafion according on the oxford dicfionary is

‘facts provided or learned about something or someone’

The definifions of truth from oxford dicfionary are

_‘the quality or state of being true.’_

_‘that which is true or in accordance with fact or reality’_

_a fact or belief that is accepted as true._

In clause 7 of the draft, the definifion of misinformafion idenfifies the first part of the Oxford
definifion and adds is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm but omits the
intenfionality of the person sharing the informafion.

In clause 7 the definifion of disinformafion acknowledges the informafion to be false, misleading or
decepfive and is intended to mislead but adds is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious
_harm._

If the definifions of informafion, misinformafion or disinformafion, from the oxford dicfionary are
accepted, then any informafion a person has learned about a topic is not misinformafion or
**disinformafion unless they intenfionally or deliberately intend to mislead someone.**

What is truth? It would seem that truth is relafive in our country and is based on what the individual
chooses to believe about something and not as stated in the English dicfionary as being based in
**facts or reality or accepted as true. The following is an example of the way Australia has accepted**
the changed definifion of a word that was historically accepted as true

The Oxford, Webster and Cambridge dicfionary definifion of a women is an adult female human
_being. In Australia today according to LGBT foundafion a woman can be anyone who idenfifies as a_
_woman this is subjecfive definifion based on feelings not facts and doesn’t take into considerafion_
the accepted facts about gender such as women having XX chromosomes, having ovaries, and a
uterus aftached to a vagina which makes it possible for a woman to give birth to a child.

If truth is relafive then misinformafion and disinformafion are relafive based on an individuals
personal beliefs about a topic.

If a young person considering transifioning to the opposite gender, than the one they were born
with, is told that ‘puberty blockers are reversible’hftps://www.healthline.com/health/are-puberty-blockers-reversible,
that in my opinion is misinformafion and disinformafion as ‘the effects on the brain are largely
[unknown’ (hftps://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.8675580) . Studies have shown this not to be true in terms](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.8675580)
of what happens to the body and brain of a young person as outlined in this arficle
//www.iwf.org/2022/12/13/puberty-blockers-were-never-reversible-or-temporary/.

This informafion also has the potenfial to cause harm as there are no longitudinal studies to back the
claim that they are reversible, so the statement ‘puberty blockers reversible’ should be classified as
misinformafion. My concern is that this statement will not be said to be misinformafion as the issue
of gender is such a hot topic, our polificians cannot define what a woman is for fear of offending a
minority in our country and so to categorise this statement as misinformafion would be difficult as it
is what is being seen as truth although the facts of studies and fime do not back this up.

Who will decide what is truth/ misinformafion/disinformafion? Will those who decide on what is
misinformafion/ disinformafion come from a wide variety of backgrounds and belief systems or will
they represent a certain secfion of our society?

Will the topics monitored to find out what is misinformafion/disinformafion cover all topics and all
users on digital plafforms, or will certain groups such as those who hold tradifional values, pro-life
organisafions, Chrisfians, Muslims, covid dissenters and others who quesfion what is happening in
our country or world be targeted?

I have great concerns about this draft legislafion,

That it will represent the views of certain groups not a cross secfion of society

Will not hold governments accountable for misinformafion and disinformafion they share.

That it will squash freedom of speech as digital plafforms censor content to avoid lifigafion
and fines.

Will target certain groups.

Will put vulnerable people at risk because they are not given valuable informafion.

Will in effect cause harm to the people it is seeking to protect by not giving them a balanced
set of informafion to allow them to make informed decisions.

Australia has always been a country where debate and discussion about controversial topics has
been expected and encouraged. Currently we have our Prime Minister saying that those who oppose
the Voice legislafion are disseminafing misinformafion and disinformafion, just because they oppose
what the government is proposing. Are people now to be afraid to speak for fear of reprisals from
government bodies such as the ACMA, who will have the power to fine digital plafforms such as
search engines, news aggregators, social media and podcast services up to $6.8million or 5% of their
global turnover and individuals are also liable to fines, whilst the legislafion will not apply to the
government.

I believe this draft legislafion is another step towards government control of our thoughts and beliefs
and has a pecuniary aspect to ensure we comply with what the ACMA sees as misinformafion and

disinformafion. I am vehemently opposed to pufting this type of power into the hands of a few
flawed human beings.
