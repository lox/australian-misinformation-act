I am opposed to any restriction of fundamental human rights including freedom of speak and
expression by digital or any other means. This bill aims to restrict these fundamental rights and is
therefore a violation of all Australian’s fundamental rights. This bill should be dismissed in any form,
and with any amendment due to the blatant intent to violate fundamental human rights.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has no right to impose substantial,
unilateral, and discretionary authority over media channels and any intent to do so would be a
violation of our fundamental human rights. Once these rights are lost, they will never be returned to
us, the Australian people.

This bill is prone to misapplication by nefarious, negligent, or otherwise compromised members of
ACMA and the government more generally. This sort of behaviour has already been witnessed on
countless occasions by the Australian people through the ‘covid-19’ pandemic where the population
was subjected to mandatory vaccinations, social distancing requirements, fear-based government
funded propaganda, lies and deceit by politicians, plus many other violations of our fundamental
human right to live freely and without prejudice.

The fact that this bill has been prepared and offered for consideration is evidence of the totalitarian
intent of this government to strip the Australian people of their fundamental human rights.

Everyone has the right to hold opinion without interference.

Everyone has the right to freedom of expression including the right to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the
form of art, or through any other media.

This bill proposes to allow ACMA power to create ‘Misinformation Codes’ and ‘Misinformation
Standards’ which would apply to anybody who disseminates information publicly save for those
explicitly excepted from the Bill’s operation (mainstream/ professional media and Government).

All peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their
political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development.

This bill intends to restrict the views and opinions which people are post on internet platforms
thereby impeding their fundamental right to self-determination.

Any person’s involved in the production, development, or promotion of this bill should be held to
question as to their personal involvement in their intent to deny the Australian people their
fundamental human rights. They should be withdrawn from public office and prosecuted accordingly
if they are found to have conspired to restrict the inherent human rights of any and all Australians of
their freedom of speech.

The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) has an explicit statutory function to examine
enactments for the purpose of ascertaining whether they would be inconsistent or contrary to any
human right. All new bills passed must be accompanied by a Statement of Compatibility which
assesses the compatibility of the proposed legislation with the rights and freedoms recognised in the
seven-core international human rights treaties that Australia has ratified, including the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Such statement should be publicly released
immediately given the gravity and proposed scope of the Bill, so that the public can meaningfully
consider whether the Department has paid appropriate mind to those rights. There should also be
immediate establishment of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in full transparency.

Open exchange of opinion and ideas is vital to a democratic society, and such openness is vital to
human rights protections. Digital internet platforms should not be required to remove any content
solely based on its alleged falsity if the content is not otherwise unlawful.

This bill would render any citizen who chooses to express themselves in a digital form subject to
regulatory frameworks that are yet to be created, unilaterally imposed by ACMA, and not subject to
meaningful challenge. This would signal the end of the internet as a free market of ideas and
opinions and render criticism of Government, an essential element of any healthy democracy,
vulnerable to civil and criminal prosecution.

When the public is no longer the arbiter of truth, and that role becomes usurped by bureaucrats and
governments, the resultant censorship erodes the publics’ trust in authority.

I fundamentally and vehemently oppose this Bill. If allowed to pass this Bill will clearly show that the
Australian Government seeks total control of the dissemination of information within this country,
and that such control is more valuable to that Government than the rights of its citizenry.
