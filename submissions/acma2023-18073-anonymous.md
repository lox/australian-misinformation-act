To Whom It May Concern,

I strongly object to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
**Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is a gross overreach of government authority.**

It is not in the government's or any government agency's purview to determine what should
be identified as "misinformation", "disinformation" or any other similar words.

Digital platforms should be treated like a utility. My telephone doesn't censor me, it simply
transmits what I say. Digital platforms should operate exactly like this. We are not children. If
we don't like what someone else says, or disagree, we can debate it or ignore it. We don't
need some faceless fact checker to ensure that we align with any particular narrative. This is
too open to abuse.

Freedom of speech means that every voice can be heard, no matter what they say. If certain
people or groups or authorities don't like the opinions expressed, the solution is to speak
their own version of the issue, NOT to suppress the offending statement.
