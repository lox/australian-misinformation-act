I wish to make a submission about the draft Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I have a Bachelor of arts in Community Development (sociology) and have worked in a wide range of industries including
medical, veterinary, agriculture, sales, small business and hospitality. I have been a volunteer in associations and school
committees. I am a parent of three children and currently do advocacy work for a not for profit organisation. I have spent my
whole life learning how to stand up for the rights of those less fortunate than me and have realised the essential power and value
of our beautiful constitution is key to everyone's wellbeing.

The Government has absolutely no right to present such a communistic amendment to the parliament! We did not vote for this!
The real living voice of the people is the essential uncontrollable power in the constitution, not the whims or power interests of the
parliament! Could this be treason? It certainly looks like it!

This bill tramples on freedom of speech, It compels big tech to silence discussion which – even unintentionally – causes “harm” to
such a broad range of targets that almost anything can be construed as such. This bill relies upon online platforms to play it as
safe-as-possible, thus remove whatever could potentially be labelled “mis/disinformation” before they get fined for not doing so.
Must we live in fear?

A cursory look at history reveals that many ideas which were unpopular, controversial, or even universally condemned later
turned out to be true! Since the plandemic, there are evident and emerging instances of "so-called" facts which even governmental
departments have been compelled to back-track on. Consequently there is no reason to trust government efforts at legislation
change.

We the people, must retain the standing of free speech, the right to access distribute and discuss openly un censored media
material except, of course, in the case of child pornography and associated atrocities! Humanity has not become infallible since
then, and certainly not this government. Those nations that allowed their government this sort of power all suffer now beneath the
tyrannical authority of dictatorships and authoritarian rule.

Why is this government initiating this now? Why would an honest and honorable parliament, assigned to serve "we the people"
seek to legislate that power away from us? We are the final authority ! I would be asking who initiated this? Are they somewhat a
threat to Australian wellbeing and sovereignty? This is government overreach, reeks of communism and the murmurings of a
dictatorship.

Moreover, the exclusion of government-authorised content from this censorship regime raises even more alarm bells! This
establishes one standard for government and another standard for ordinary Australians, leaving the government free hold on
propaganda, silence the rightful constitution and we the people and usher in a totalitarian regime, over time, as is consistent with
those members of parliament who also serve as Fabians and their sly communistic creep! (See "The Naked Communist 45 Goals
")

I therefore demand the Department abandon this legislation, return to the truths and ideologies of the Australian constitution, and
focus on empowering individuals with critical thinking skills, education and awareness campaigns, particularly for migrants and
those of whom English is their second language. So that every one is aware of the richness and authority of our constitution and
are subsequently able to repel other regulations which infringe upon fundamental freedoms of Australians.
This is your duty as servants to "we the people".
