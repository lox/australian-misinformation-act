A law which proposes to allow one government body aka ACMA to be the arbiter of
what constitutes misinformation and disinformation poses a complete threat to free
speech in Australia. This is far more serious a concern than treating the population
with the respect they deserve and that has always existed to allow them to
determine for themselves what they believe based on their own research and
interpretation.

Every truly democratic country enshrines free speech as the cornerstone of what
differentiates them from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes.

Former High Court Judge Michael Kirby once said “Australia has less protection of
free speech than most Western countries”.

If this bill is passed into law, it puts Australia in a similar league to communist
countries of the world.

This is not what our forefathers fought for when they participated in world wars to
keep this country free. The first line of our National Anthem may as well be changed,
as freedom will no longer exist with one government department if charge of what
can and cannot be said.
