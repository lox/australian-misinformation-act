I do not want ACMA or any other government body to have the power to determine what is and
what is not misinformation or disinformation or the truth online. I refer to the ‘The Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023’ - the Bill. The
Bill’s definition of misinformation and disinformation is tantamount to assigning ACMA as an
unelected body the power to decide what truth is. Misinformation and disinformation do not pose a
threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy, as
is being argued. We have adequate laws in place to address slander and libel.

There is no requirement for a mature and advanced liberal democracy, such as in Australia, for an
authoritarian and controlling government bureaucracy to impose a new intolerance to free speech
and thought, which is an attempt to silence uncomfortable voices of dissent. The definition of
misinformation and disinformation in the Bill is broad and wide and assigns power to determine
truth to unelected bureaucrats. The Bill gives the government the power to censure and silence all
Australian individuals.

Common law
Australians enjoy common law protection. An established principle of statutory interpretation in
Australian courts is that Parliament is presumed not to have intended to limit fundamental rights,
unless it indicates this intention in clear terms. This includes freedom of expression.

Freedom of information, opinion and expression
This Bill is a direct contradiction to the principle of freedom of expression already enshrined in the
UN’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966), Article 19: “Everyone shall
have the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all
kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any
other media of his choice. … It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only
be such as are provided by law and are necessary: For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals.”

General comment 34, from the ICCPR, emphasises that freedom of expression and opinion are the
foundation stone for a free and democratic society and a necessary condition for the promotion and
protection of human rights.

Constitutional law
While the Australian Constitution does not explicitly protect freedom of expression, the High Court
has held that an implied freedom of political communication exists as an indispensable part of the
system of representative and responsible government created by the Constitution. In Nationwide
News Pty Ltd v Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1 and Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v the Commonwealth
(1992) 177 CLR 106, the majority of the High Court held that an implied freedom of political
communication exists as an incident of the system of representative government established by the
Constitution.

States human rights laws
Section 15 of the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) states: “Every person
has the right to hold an opinion without interference. Every person has the right to freedom of
expression which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all
kinds, whether within or outside Victoria and whether- (a) orally; or (b) in writing; or (c) in print; or
(d) by way of art; or (e) in another medium chosen by him or her.” Again, the limitation of those

rights is in regard to the rights and reputation of other persons or national security, public order,
public health or public morality. But, this in no way extends to the broad definition of
misinformation or disinformation as stated in the Bill.

Overseas law
Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms states that: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include
freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by
public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the
licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.”

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States refers to a right to freedom of speech
and press freedom in more absolute terms than Article 19 of the ICCPR referred to above, or the
equivalent provision of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms: “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech or of the
press … .”

The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023 is itself a threat to freedom of speech and expression. It should not become legislation or
statute law in a free and democratic Australia.
