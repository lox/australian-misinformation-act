I grew up in in the communist dictatorship of East Germany. Freedom of speech was
severely restricted, with the government deciding what was true and false, what was allowed
to be said and what wasn’t. Anyone not abiding was punished with prison and restrictions
(career, education, freedom of movement etc). During the 80s I managed to get hold of a
(forbidden) copy of George Orwell’s 1984. The contents of the book were only a small step
further from East German reality. This nightmare ended with the fall of the Berlin wall in
1989.
The new proposed Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation Bill is a good step along
the way of recreating this nightmare. In the passages of this bill I recognise a lot of the ways
how dissenting voices were silenced.

In order to combat misinformation and disinformation, we need honest and open discussion
and dialogue, not the government deciding what currently goes as “truth”. There is a history
of misleading and incomplete information spread a by our government, and some claims
labelled as 'disinformation' are demonstrably true.
We are adults and are capable to dealing with information we come across. I would rather
use my own judgement than trust “experts” who have their own agenda. We have seen how
this has worked out in the past.
I do not accept any restrictions or limitations on my freedom of speech.
