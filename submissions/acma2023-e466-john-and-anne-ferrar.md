To Whom It May Concern

Thank you for the opportunity so submit our views on the proposed Misinformation and
Disinformation laws which would provide ACMA with new powers to combat online misinformation
and disinformation.

On the surface, it all sounds like a good idea, after all, nobody wants to be given mis – or disinformation.

However, as an example: – in relation to covid, we find that that is exactly what happened. The
government has been responsible for causing irreparable harm to many families in insisting that the
‘safe, effective and tested‘ experimental jabs be made mandatory, while at the same time outlawing
safe and trusted remedies. Many of the so-called ‘conspiracy theorists’ have since been proved
correct. They are neither safe, nor effective, with thousands now adversely affected. Yet government
is still pushing this dangerous agenda without honest & free debate. Who will call them to account?

What has this to do with the proposed bill?

I am sure that excellent people have been chosen by ACMA to fulfil this role – but what guide or
plumbline will they use to determine Misinformation without verifiable debate and factual evidence
from opposing views? They, like all of us, are fallible human beings who do not have all the facts and
make mistakes and giving such powers is Orwellian in nature and destructive to the welfare of a free
and open society. History has shown it can and will be misused for political purposes and agendas.


# What is free speech in Australia? Govt website


# Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.

What I fear is that arbitrary decisions, regarding anything controversial political or emotional, is that
decisions can then be made on the grounds of misinformation, without any freedom and pathway to
appeal – while the government remains above the law?

  - the hurried takeover of Calvary Hospital in Canberra –

  - Climate change –

  - the huge assault on our children, by undermining parental authority

to name a few more examples.

# If the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent, we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter. ...
