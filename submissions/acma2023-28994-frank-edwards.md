To the director, department of infrastructure, transport, regional development, communications and
the arts.

Dear director,

I profoundly hope that you will do everything possible to prevent the passing of the
communications legislation amendment (combatting misinformation and disinformation) bill 2023.

As there is no definition of misinformation or of disinformation, and as history has shown that long
term truths are often eclipsed by short term commercial advantage, then a bill such as this one will
become a convenient gag used by business and government for stifling public debate of important
social issues.

The tobacco industry would have loved legislation such as this. The fossil fuel industries will
certainly make maximum use of it. Nuclear proliferation advocates and numerous environmental
vandals, also.

It is a really bad idea.

I hope it does not come to pass.
