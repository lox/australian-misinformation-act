Submission by Protect Free Speech:

**_Preamble to the proposed Bill explanation:_**
**_"Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians_**
**_, as well as to our democracy, society and economy."_**

It is with much disappointment that I write this submission. The issue as described in the preamble above
says that "misinformation _and_ _disinformation_ _pose_ _a_ _threat_ _to_ _the_ _safety_ _and_ _wellbeing_ _of_ _Australians_ _as_
_well_ _as_ _to_ _our_ _democracy, society_ _and_ _economy"._
I believe that that statement is false. Therefore, I would be censored for having a different view from that
statement, if this Bill was in force.

It would not matter whether I could back up my view with evidence from a courtcase - perhaps a ruling of
a High Court Judge. I have experienced being censored for posting such a ruling on social media about 2
years ago. The post (which was not in any way written by me but was a news article) went against the
"guidelines" of Facebook at the time. I have not used Facebook since then.

I am against censorship, but I have been reminded that there must be some censorship to protect our
morality and uphold community values. So rather than discuss the proposed Bill as a form of censorship, I
will object on the grounds that it does not allow any sharing of opposing opinions.

I defend free speech, even when I disagree with others' views. That is what democracy is about. People are
not so stupid that they cannot decide for themselves what is true or not. It is the nature of facts, especially
anything scientific in nature, whether it be about the environment or health that facts change with time
and experience. Data is collected over time and the changes bring us more information. We will not be
exposed to that information if ACMA decides what is truth.

We will have no scientific advances and we will be living in a police state if the only truth we are allowed to
hear is what ACMA or the government decides is the truth. We call these truths the dominant narrative. A
narrative is a story. I would rather use the scientific inquiry method of hearing various alternative
viewpoints and evidence before formulating my opinion. I do not want to be told what to think and only be
given the facts that are approved by ACMA or the government dominant narrative.

There are already sufficient laws that protect people from harm. We slander and lie at our peril. We could
be taken to court if we promote harm. However, this Bill is not helping the general public, but is a tool to
shut down free speech.

I am now going to quote some famous people here:
Bishop Desmond Tutu: If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the
oppressor.
*This Bill is designed to oppress those who have views or facts contrary to the ACMA or government. Leave
our speech alone.

Voltaire: It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong.

- I repeat: It is an injustice to limit free speech just because it differs from the established authorities. And
as Voltaire said, at times the contrary view is correct.

hysteria. The "official" views presented in the mainstream media have now been shown to be wrong on so
many issues; from lockdowns, masks, social distancing, "vaccine" efficacy and effectiveness, and 2 weeks
to flatten the curve.

Martin Luther King Jr: We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was "legal".
*In other words, there are some things that are just wrong, even if they are "legal".
Leonardo Da Vinci: It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.
*If we do not stop this Bill before it is introduced, it is the end of free speech, which is sharing our opinions
and it will impact free thinking.

If this Bill is implemented, we cannot hope to turn our once free country of Australia back to a democratic
country. This limiting of the sharing of information Bill is the biggest threat to our democracy and freedom
of speech that we have ever faced. It will impact on our religious and personal freedoms and will encroach
on our basic human rights to think for ourselves and to not be treated as brainless slaves.

Robert F Kennedy Jr says that his father told him that "people in authority lie and the job in a democracy is
to remain skeptical." Robert F Kennedy Jr has been a believer in science since he was a child. He requires
evidence before believing something and will not take the word of official narratives without evidence.
"The way you do research is not by asking authoritative figures what they think. Trusting experts is not a
feature of science, and it is not a feature of democracy. It is a feature of religion and totalitarianism." RFK Jr

The Indigenous Voice to Parliament is presented by the government as being something that all indigenous
people want, but if we had a dis and mis information Bill in effect, we would not hear that a large
percentage of indigenous elders who live in remote communities are not in favour of the Indigenous Voice
to Parliament. They do not want the Constitution to be changed to make them subject to Parliament. They
want to keep their sovreignty. They have not been consulted. I know this because I have been allowed to
see their words printed, hear their words speaking in videos, see their powerful presentations and listen to
their opposing views.

So no, I do not approve the Australian government introducing this proposed legislation to form a Ministry
of Truth where Australian citizens will no longer be allowed to hear alternate views or express an opinion
on many different matters.
We need to preserve the freedoms for which our forefathers fought for in wars. Censorship like this is
worthy of Communist China, but not worthy of our freedom-loving country.

How can open debate and free speech be dangerous to our country? Seriously, we are not that stupid.
Anyone who promotes this legislation must think that Australians are so stupid that they are going to get
their feelings hurt over whatever the ACMA deems is hurtful. There will always be people who do try to
lead others astray and down wrong paths. Especially with Artificial Intelligence increasing to get into the
writing of stories and the possibility that we will not know if the author is real or an AI entity.

We will need to be super vigilant to investigate all stories for their accuracy and authenticate sources.
However, it is a good and necessary part of remaining a democratic nation to be allowed to do our own
research and to share ideas.

It is a dangerous thing to have truth in the central control of one organisation such as ACMA or any
government or government body. Please do not do this. Please do not take away our free speech. It is just
not acceptable. No. Not in any way, shape or form can we have this kind of censorship. It is an overreach to
call unpopular notions mis and disinformation. If information is wrong, it always gets found out. Truth
cannot be hidden. With enough time, the truth is always found out. However, ACMA and any government
does not have a monopoly on the truth


-----

I find it difficult to believe that the ACMA is an independent regulator. It is doing the job of monitoring
what is "truth" for the government, following government policy. How is that independent?

My final point: The government and ACMA were never appointed by we the people to be the arbitors of
truth. They do not have our permission to limit our freedom to express our opinions (within the law). Leave
free speech alone. It is not dangerous for people to have a different opinion from the government. After
all, we do have opposing views in politics and there are many different political parties. When the
government becomes the arbitor of truth, we have tyranny, we will have totalitarianism. Please do not
proceed down this path towards total control of the citizens of Australia.
