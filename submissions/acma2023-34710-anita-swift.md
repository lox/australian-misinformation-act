Dear Officer

"The Issue" section on the website seeking input states:
"Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy."

On the contrary, _government_ _interference_ _in_ _free_ _speech_ _and_ _communication_
_between_ _citizens_ poses a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, and
_especially_ to our democracy, society and economy.

This is the most frightening piece of legislation that I am aware has been
proposed during my whole life as an Australian Am I living in North

Korea now?

Critical questions that have been left unanswered are:

1. Who decides what constitutes "misinformation"?

Today's misinformation is often tomorrow's truth. This is the nature of
information        - knowledge progresses via discussion, evaluation, debate and
considering opposing viewpoints. We have a wonderful opportunity though
digital media to engage in this and contribute to it. At best, it seems very
arrogant of government/ACMA to consider themselves the sole arbiters of what
is accurate information. At worst, it seems a giant step towards a totalitarian
nightmare.

2. Who decides whether content is "disinformation"?

How do you know whether content is "reasonably likely to cause or contribute
to serious harm".

It could likely be argued that any information (and especially professional news)
could be reasonably likely to be seriously harmful to someone's mental health.

# 3. Why is professional news content excluded? Why are governments and government educational institutions excluded?

There is no rationale or evidence to show that these bodies are any more
reliable than private citizens when it comes to providing accurate information. If
there are going to be rules, they should apply equally to everyone.

The draft Bill definitely does not strike a balance on freedom of expression. It
entirely removes freedom of expression online, and limits expression to
anything the "Ministry of Truth" (aka ACMA) approves at the time.

A bill that allows a government agency to require private corporations to spy on
individuals and "keep records" pertaining to communications between them
has no place in a liberal democracy.

Sincerely
Anita Swift
