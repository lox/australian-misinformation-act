**New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation Bill**


I wish to make strong representation in relation to the proposed New ACMA powers to
combat misinformation and disinformation Bill. This Bill must NOT proceed in any way,
shape or form.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that must not be watered down or removed for a
multitude of reasons, not the least to ensure that a tyrannical government or group of
individuals can use censorship of opinions to crush dissent, in order to create a dystopian
Communist regime against the will of the people. Australia has been a democratic country
up until now and that is how it should remain.

The Australian population are intelligent enough to be able to listen to opinions and
determine for themselves if those opinions are either correct or disinformation or
misinformation without government interference.

When governments pressure social media sites to sensor what they don’t like, as has been
evidenced throughout the Plandemic, this is clearly a violation of our civil rights and does
actually place us all in harm. I for one of very many, would prefer to take advice on health
issues from extremely well respected doctors like Peter McCulloch, rather than discredited
government officials, politicians and bureaucrats.

Dr Peter McCulloch along with many other well respected doctors, were censored
throughout the Plandemic, which in my opinion led to the unnecessary deaths and vaccine
injuries suffered by hundreds of thousands of people across the globe. Had these wise
doctors been allowed to provide the information that they had without being censored,
then I have no doubt a very large percentage of those deaths and injuries could have been
avoided.

My understanding of the use of Emergency Powers for vaccines can only be implemented if
there is no alternative treatments. Well clearly there were and are treatments beside the so
called “vaccines” that didn’t work. Hundreds of thousands of Australians were coerced to
take the vaccine or lose their jobs and it is my opinion that everyone responsible for these
mandates and coercion must be held accountable Nuremburg style. No doubt no politician,
bureaucrat or other government official involved in these mandates and or coercion, would
want my opinion to be publicised for fear that they may very well one day actually be held
to account.

It is again my understanding that the proposed powers for ACMA do not include
accountability for government under the same rules. Rules for them but not for me it
seems!

It has become extremely clear that our government, many politicians and bureaucrats can
not be trusted to provide factual, honest and unbiased information to the Australian public.
