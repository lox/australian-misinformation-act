IMPORTANT; look at the thread from the attached link, news and public notice,
Why did you not get this news and public notice?
Because if you had, they wouldn’t of been able to control you?
Based on the total lack of accuracy in testing do you really think you should of been restricted? No.

Expert 4, Centre for disease control (CDC)
The centre for disease control has what they call a “Pandemic assessment quadrant”.
This again is based on epidemiology.
This is hidden far away from you to see.
In this assessment the CDC class difference risk levels differently.
A low to medium level risk is 18% infection rate.
A extreme level risk is 30% infection rate.
As can be evidenced later, Australian infection rates (without any need for restrictions and evidenced by the
CEBM), have been less than 0.7%.
Does this sound like you needed to be restricted? No.
Now if you look at the second chart, the CDC have recommendations for each level of risk.
Now if you skip the lowest risk( which Australia never came close too) and you look at the extreme risk,
nowhere is it mentioned any restrictions enforcement.
Does this sound like you should of been restricted? No.

Expert 5, Australian Government Department of Health
The Australian government department of Health has a training program on its website which reinforces what
the WHO state:
“The coronavirus disease is otherwise known as Covid 19 and is caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
Most people who become infected with the virus will only experience mild to moderate symptoms and will
recover without any special treatment.”
Now understand this
This is reinforced by the number of positive cases that recover without any treatment prior to any vaccine
availability. Just by staying at home.
They also mentioned that a small number only 5% of the population may develop serious symptoms and get
very sick and that’s only “may”.
Now understand that with an infection rate of 0.7% it’s absolutely impossible to get 5% develop serious
illness.
Does this sound like you should of been restricted? No.

Now let’s look at legislation.
The public health and well-being act guidelines for disease control ( we do not have a disease outbreak)
Extract:

PART 8—MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, MICRO-ORGANISMS AND MEDICAL
CONDITIONS

Now let’s look at Australia as a whole.

Now where does it any of these figures suggest an infection rate of anywhere near a low to moderate
risk(CDC) of 18%.
Now let me also stress that I have many more statistics to back this up, just too many to put into this
correspondence.
Let me also assure you of another interesting observation.
When we in Melbourne we’re eventually let out of our ring of steel, I visited Albury, and found they were
business as usual.
Now look at their % infection rate.
Wow you wonder why that might be, re read the CEBM, and you will understand why you and no other
Australian should of been negatively affected by any pandemic response.
Let’s not forget the bio security act was brought in to control a disease outbreak but everything above proves
we cannot have a disease outbreak if we don’t have a virus transmission outbreak which is what causes the
disease.

Now from the ALRC link above, can anyone show where exactly it states that any member of parliament,
