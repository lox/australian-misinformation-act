I would like to voice my opposition to the misinformation/disinformation Bill.

I have questionsâ€¦.

Who decides what is Misinformation or Disinformation and what makes them qualified to
decide what I am allowed to see and not see?

What we have seen in the last 3 or so years is government and media making false claim
after false claim, that is either really poor governance or plain outright lies. So how can
anyone trust them to be the arbiters of truth with that track record.

Why is the Government and media allowed to spread misinformation to Australians, but
the speech of ordinary citizens is being censored?

This Orwellian style, government approved censorship that is being proposed is
abhorrent. A similar type of censorship in the US was ruled unconstitutional and antidemocratic.

Who will be liable when this supposed mis/disinformation turns out to be true and
factual?

These draconian ideas have the potential to cause serious harm to Australians, as we
have seen in recent years. We grow as a nation by sharing thoughts, ideas and beliefs,
when this is stifled in the form of censorship we are dangerously close to tyranny.
