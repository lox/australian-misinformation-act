Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)
Bill 2023

Introduction Freedom of information and free speech are fundamental pillars of any
democratic society.

They allow individuals to express their opinions, engage in critical thinking, and hold those in
power accountable. However, this is a concerning government bill that seeks to restrict
these essential rights. This document aims to present arguments against the proposed
legislation, highlighting the dangers of limiting freedom of information and free speech.

1. Government's Propagation of Misinformation

Over the past few years, the government and its bureaucrats have been the primary
propagators of mis and disinformation. Their dangerous lies have caused significant
harm to the Australian people, the economy, and society at large. It is therefore
perplexing that this legislation fails to address the government's role as the biggest
source of misinformation.

2. Suppressing Dissent and Removing Free Speech

The legislation appears to be designed to eliminate any sources of dissent against
the government in power, thereby restricting free speech and the right to debate. It
aims to remove independent media sources and social media platforms that provide
alternative perspectives, including references to scientific facts and peer-reviewed
evidence. Such restrictions undermine the democratic process and hinder the
discovery of truth.

3. Orwellian Censorship and Removal of Truth

The bill employs the terms "misinformation" and "disinformation" to mask its true
intent, which is to control narratives and suppress dissenting voices. If the legislation
were honest, it would acknowledge that the truth and scientific facts pose no threat
to the safety and well-being of Australians. Instead, it aims to establish Orwellian
censorship, eradicate thought crimes, and deny citizens access to the truth.

4. Inaccurate Labelling of Information

The legislation's definition of misinformation as content that is false, misleading, or
deceptive is flawed. Numerous instances have occurred where information initially
labelled as misinformation was later proven to be true. Examples include statements
about the mandated nature of certain medical treatments, their limitations in
preventing transmission, their distribution throughout the body, the origin of SARS

CoV-2, and the efficacy of repurposed drugs. Such mislabelling of information
undermines public trust and impedes the discovery of truth.

5. Removal of Global Information Sources

The legislation seeks to censor not only what is published within Australia but also
internet content accessible to Australians worldwide. By restricting access to global
information and news sources, the legislation poses a significant harm to the
Australian population, economy, environment, and democratic processes.
Throughout history, those who have sought to limit information and destroy history
have never been on the side of what is right.

6. Passing Responsibility to Digital Platforms

The bill's attempt to pass the responsibility for addressing misinformation and
disinformation onto digital platforms is merely an evasion of accountability. Without
clear guidance from the government on approved narratives and information,
platforms will struggle to determine what is permissible. This approach risks
restricting freedom of speech and undermines the government's responsibility to
protect democratic values.

7. Eliminating Public Discussion and Debate

The legislation exempts authorized electoral and referendum content, professional
news, and satire from regulation. This exemption, coupled with the absence of
independent voices, suggests a deliberate attempt to eliminate public discussion,
questioning, and debate that is not funded by the government in power. Such a
restriction erodes freedom of speech and enables the consolidation of power
without accountability.

Conclusion

The proposed government legislation is an affront to the principles of freedom of
information and free speech. By targeting independent sources of information and
dissenting voices, the legislation threatens the democratic fabric of Australia. Its lack
of interest in truth and the elimination of diverse perspectives are not aligned with
the values of a fair and free society. It is crucial to defeat this legislation to safeguard
the rights and liberties that are the cornerstone of a truly democratic nation.

Yours sincerely
