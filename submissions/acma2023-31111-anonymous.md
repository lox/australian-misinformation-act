To Members of the Australian Parliament,

I write with concerns regarding the clarity and transparency of the proposed

Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and

Disinformation) Bill 2023, introduced by the Labor Party.

I hold sincere concerns that this proposed amendment will limit our democratic right

to ‘Freedom of Speech’ and reduce people’s right to a voice, for fear of punishment

and/or retribution.

In a democratic society like Australia, there are certain rights and freedoms that we

cherish. One of these rights is the freedom of speech, which allows us to express our

thoughts, opinions, and ideas openly – without fear of punishment or censorship.

Australia, as a democratic society, needs to continue to allow its citizens to discuss

important matters, challenge authority and contribute to public debates. Free

speech promotes diversity, creativity and progress, by encouraging the exchange of

different perspectives. In a democracy, everyone’s voice matters, regardless of their

age, gender or social status – with the exception of hate speech or incite of

violence toward others.

Free speech enables citizens to participate actively in the decision-making process,

providing a platform for debate, dissent, and accountability. It ensures that

governments are transparent and open to criticism, which helps prevent the abuse

of power. Free speech allows citizens to express their concerns and bring attention

to social and political issues that need addressing.

As an educator, we teach students to be critical thinkers; and we teach them that

all authors have a bias or particular view point in what they write. We also teach

students to look for a minimum of three pieces of information saying the same thing,

to determine the truthfulness of an article. Then based on our own beliefs and

values, culture and societal ideologies, we determine our own version of what is true.

Two people can see the same information and still come away with different

perspectives and interpretations. I feel strongly that we need to be allowed to have

individual thought and to hear debates from all sides, so that as free thinkers, smart

adults, we can find a middle ground of what we believe to be true or to side with

the group of similar views – all within the realms of what it means to be an Australian

– care for our fellow man with respect for all.

My concerns for the proposed bill are as follows:

Do we need another organisation when we already have organisations in place

that manage national security, international issues, terrorism etc?

How many people will form ACMA and what will their credentials be that qualify

them to be the authority on what is ‘truth’, in regard to misinformation and

disinformation? Science is ever evolving, facts and situations change eg When I

went to university to become a teacher, certain theories and ideologies were

presented as current, best practice. 15 years later, those theories are being

replaced with new ‘best practice based on research-based evidence’. While at

university, I questioned some of these theories, because they didn’t make sense to

me based on what seemed reasonable. What was true then, is not true now, and I

was right to question, debate and provide reasoning for my thoughts. Without

questioning, ideas get stuck and become limited. Consider how many students we

failed because everyone just followed the norm of what they were told was correct,

rather than query, ask further questions; look for a better way to achieve more

successive outcomes.

Look at covid – many things were said to be untrue or partially untrue at the start of

Covid, which later turned out to be corrected. Debate and opinions are essential for

growth of thought.

For ACMA to deem certain information to be ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’, I

would expect their claims to be supported with facts or data, to confirm such

judgement; and I would advocate for a process of appeal to be available. How

can there be one universal truth when truth is different things to different people?

Why is this amendment targeted at just online digital platforms? What about other

modalities like mainstream media, news, newspapers, radio shows, magazines etc –

are they not written with a certain bias that could also be seen as disrupting public

health responses, inferences to foreign interference in elections and undermining of

democratic institutions.

Why are these powers needed? Online platforms already seem to be monitoring

and fact checking information. Not that I agree with this, as I believe as smart

individuals, we all have a right to have our say and share our thoughts. Critical

thinking comes from listening to both sides, then forming an opinion. This is what we

teach students at school. This is what is in the Australian Curriculum.

Under your category of ‘Serious Harm’, laws already exist to deal with these

assertions of harm. The Online Safety Act 2021 already exists, along with an eSafety

Commissioner. Why do we need an additional organisation (ACMA) with arbitrary

power to decide what is true and what is not?

The amendment proposal needs to include more examples of what a breach may

possibly look like. I am of the strong opinion that this feels like a Big Brother

movement, designed to control and monitor free speech, and prevent freedom of

thought. It will subdue Australian citizens from having a voice and move

communication underground. Much better for communication to be upfront,

transparent and visible for all to see. In today’s online world, people are quick to

contribute their thoughts and viewpoints if they like or don’t like what is being said.

I don’t agree that there should be exemptions for politicians, mainstream media,

educators and comedians. What is good for the goose, is good for the gander. The

exemptions create an imbalance in the treatment of different voices and different

viewpoints. Many independent media groups have organically grown over the past

few years, and I advocate for their right to continue discussion, debate, conduct

interviews, share research papers and advise of documented facts and figures. I am

smart enough, educated enough to sift through what I hear to determine what I

believe to be true; based on my own moral compass, societal and familial values. I

don’t see how restrictions on digital media can protect us from serious harm, when


-----

misinformation and disinformation can still be presented to the public via

mainstream media, news outlets, magazines, radio etc.

In light of these concerns, I, the undersigned, call on the Parliament to:

Reject the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation

and Disinformation) Bill 2023, recognizing that it poses a threat to freedom of speech

in Australia.

Safeguard the principles of freedom of speech and expression as cornerstones of

Australian democracy, ensuring that all individuals, media outlets, and political

parties are equally protected in exercising their right to free speech.

Conduct a thorough review of the bill to address its subjective definition of

misinformation and the imbalance in protections provided to different entities,

aiming to foster a fair and inclusive environment for open public discourse.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
