**Submission in response to the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba�ng**
**Misinforma�on and Disinforma�on) Bill 2023 No., 2023 (The “Bill”)**

To whom this may concern,

I hereby lodge my response to the abovemen�oned Bill in regard to comba�ng Misinforma�on and
Disinforma�on on online pla�orms and outline my concerns with the applica�on of the proposed
legisla�on.

This Bill presents a number of concerns in its scope and poten�al applica�ons and future
consequences for all Australians and their children. The Bill has the poten�al to cause great harm to
Australia if it is to come into law.

First of all, the Government will allow itself within the Amendments (see Schedule 1) under Schedule
9, Part 1, sec�on 2, that content produced by government at all levels (Commonwealth, State and
Local) and any organisa�ons authorised or accredited by the Government will be “excluded content
for misinforma�on purposes”.

_In layman’s terms, this means that the Government will be able to say and do as it sees fit, with no_
_danger of consequence under this Bill._

If, for example the government was to endorse, order or otherwise coerce the public into taking an
ac�on that was not in their best interest financially or for their health, it would be absolved of any
responsibility. Given the current economy including the strain on young families in par�cular and in
many cases novel health issues now facing Australians in the wake of the last three years, this is very
concerning.

It is also concerning that under this Bill that intent would be considered a factor and it is within the
scope of the Bill that intent could be decided by Government rather than the originator of the
content.

The following points directly address the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
_Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023—Fact sheet, available at_
htps://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/communica�ons-legisla�onamendment-comba�ng-misinforma�on-and-disinforma�on-bill-2023-factsheet-june2023.pdf

The following is an analysis of the informa�on contained in under the sec�on �tled “Serious harm”,
with the original text appearing below in Italics.

_“The proposed powers will only apply to misinformation and disinformation that is reasonably likely_
_to cause or contribute to serious harm. The matters that are relevant to determining whether the_
_content is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm are outlined in section 2.1.2 of the_
_Guidance Note to the Bill, and clause 7 of the Bill.”_

The determina�on of whether a statement is misinforma�on or not would be subject to the
discre�on of the Government. This is especially dangerous as it will likely consider the Government
the arbiter of truth. As men�oned above, the government will have no incen�ve to avoid
misinforma�on itself, as it has excused itself from consequences.

The table below is reproduced from the Fact sheet, with the original content presented in Italics and
the addi�on of comments presented in a third column.

|Type of harm Example of serious harm Example of past or present misinformaƟon or disinformaƟon|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientatoi n, age, religion or physical or mental disability|Misinformatoi n about a group of Australians incitni g other persons to commit hate crimes against that group|It could be argued that the concept of “racial privilege” as commonly claimed by Australian media and in educaƟonal insƟtuƟons, including the publicly owned ABC would likely be causing resentment against a group of Australians which may lead to hate crimes as defined under the Racial Discriminatoi n Act 1975.|
|Disruptoi n of public order or society in Australia|Misinformatoi n that encouraged or caused people to vandalise critci al communicatoi ns infrastructure|It could be argued that a race-based referendum to give addiƟonal systemic power to one race over the others is fuelling greater divisions within Australia, with acƟvists on the affirmaƟve side suggesƟng the likelihood of civil unrest if the proposed amendment to the consƟtuƟon is not passed.|
|Harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions|Misinformatoi n undermining the impartai lity of an Australian electoral management body ahead of an electoi n or a referendum|The designaƟon of ideas inconvenient to the party in power as “misinformaƟon” could prevent or seriously curtail poliƟcal discourse among the voters and potenƟally sƟfle poliƟcal parƟes.|
|Harm to the health of Australians|Misinformatoi n that caused people to ingest or inject bleach products to treat a viral infectoi n|The coercion and force applied by Government to Australians to “stay at home for safety” in 2020 and 2021 had measurable negaƟve effects on health, both mental and physical. The resulƟng economic issues stemming from the damage to small businesses caused healthy food opƟons to become more expensive and therefore less affordable to a greater number of Australians, damaging to their health more so than the total number that may have ingested or injected bleach or suffered harm from alternaƟve treatments. The treatment offered and coerced upon Australians by government and corporaƟons for this virus was officially touted as “safe and effecƟve”. It proved not to be effecƟve as those that had accepted the treatment were sƟll able to contract the virus, become symptomaƟc and spread the pathogen to others, thus rendering it ineffecƟve.|

|Harm to the Australian environment|Misinformatoi n about water saving measures during a prolonged drought period in a major town or city|It could be argued that “renewable” energy ventures that involve the large scale clearing of natural habitat criƟcal to the survival of threatened and migratory species and threatened ecological communiƟes, and with the potenƟal to affect downstream wetland and marine habitats are not in the interests of the Australian environment. This is especially true when coupled with the economic fallout such as offshore manufacturing of components, which transfer money from the Australian economy to foreign interests, not to menƟon the constant requirement for mining of raw materials and high carbon inputs for producƟon of these components. Constant manufacturing and replacement of concrete supports, fibreglass, copper, magnets, resins and other inputs require mining of sands, petrochemicals, ores and producƟon of cement are therefore inseparable from “renewable” energy.|
|Economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy|Disinformatoi n by a foreign actor targetni g local producers in favour of imported goods|The forceful and oŌen militant blocking of the economy on the Commonwealth and State levels, parƟcularly in 2020 for the purposes of “protecƟng Australians” from a virus which, from the start was accepted that all Australians would eventually contract and most would fully recover from has leŌ the economy heavily affected with the greatest pressure on young families by rising living costs and soaring interest rates which have leŌ an increasing number homeless, or at the very least in a worse situaƟon.|

As demonstrated above, it may not be wise to vest trust in the state to handle maters pertaining to
what cons�tutes misinforma�on or disinforma�on or otherwise.

It is also par�cularly concerning that the Bill suggests that the misinforma�on – by extension the
originator of the alleged “misinforma�on”, is to blame rather than the perpetrators of acts. This is
exemplified in statements such as “Misinformation that encouraged or caused people to vandalise
_critical communications infrastructure” and “Misinformation that caused people to ingest or inject_
_bleach products to treat a viral infection”. This viewpoint assumes that the public are uterly_
incapable of thinking for themselves, and that a statement or idea will force them against their will to
do harm to themselves or others. In other words, it absolves persons of any kind of personal agency,
yet at the same �me applies total agency to the person who may be sharing an opinion in good faith
– whether they themselves are misinformed or perhaps correct at the �me and yet to be vindicated.
Could it be that the fear of the virus, as perpetrated by the media and government in the first place
put a sec�on of the popula�on in a state of fear which made them more amenable to harmful
alterna�ve “treatments?” When government is not forthcoming in admi�ng fault for misinforma�on
it disseminates, the likelihood that members of the public will believe more extreme and dangerous
conspiracy theories is greatly increased.

In conclusion, the right to access informa�on and opinions must be preserved as democracy cannot
exist concurrently with limited or controlled access to informa�on, especially considering that
misinforma�on is best dealt with openly and publicly. Removing personal agency and decisionmaking ability from some and applying it to others is also remarkably unjust and cannot be policed
fairly or effec�vely at all, especially as official viewpoints change and evolve with new data as we
have seen, par�cularly since 2019. As this is currently a Bill not passed into law it is outside the scope
and ability of the Commonwealth government to have such control over the expression of opinions,
whether correct or incorrect by the ci�zens of Australia who fund this ins�tu�on to act primarily in
their interests. The truth will always surface eventually no mater how thoroughly it may be
supressed in the moment, which is why this Bill is at best ineffec�ve or at worst a decisive leap
towards a dystopian nightmare.
