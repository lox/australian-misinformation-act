I am joining the submissions against this bill because I believe it is going too far in removing our
freedom of speech.

In times past when we did not agree on something we had discussion and debate and often one side
would concede they were wrong and sometimes we agreed to disagree.

Is not that what a democracy is all about, learning.

During the pandemic is a perfect example of why these terms Misinformation and Disinformation
should be removed from our vocabulary and should NEVER be used to silence people.

How many topics were deemed Misinformation and Disinformation that years later have become
TRUTH.

The vaccines will stop you getting covid

The vaccines will stop you spreading covid. Think of grannie you are saving her life

The vaccines will stop you from dying of covid

Masks work

Distancing works

Staying at home works

Staying away from playground works

Locking people away from each other works

Stay inside your own home

None of the things above for one worked, for two many of them have now been proven around the
world that they were done for political reasons, NOT for our health or to stop the pandemic.

Covid is just one example.

I could go on all day about the so-called mis and dis information posts that have been removed only
to be admitted later were actually the TRUTH.

When did people stop being able to think for themselves. Where has critical thinking gone. Are we
supposed to be zombies and follow everything the government says. Who says the government
knows everything, they are just people. People who live in a cocoon and not in the real world,
regardless of how humble a start in life they may have had.

The Government WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE, they should not sensor us, we have the right to free
speech and if you do not like something that is said, delete it, or turn it off. That is what we did in the
past. If you do not like a particular program, do not watch it. Simple.

I do not like all the Trans activism that is being shoved down everyoneâ€™s throat but I do not believe
they should be banned either (except from in front of our children) They have a right to say what
they want but I just turn off. I no longer watch main stream because of it. I no longer watch most
movies because of it. MY CHOICE.

This bill should NEVER EVER be passed.

Just my humble opinion. Unless of course you want to censor that as well.
