Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts,

I am writing to express my grave concern at the draft bill titled "Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". As an Australian citizen, I firmly believe that
this bill undermines our fundamental right to freedom of speech.

The creation of two classes of citizens, where politicians, journalists, and members of educational
institutions are given the power to spread information while regular citizens are restricted, is a stark
indication that this government does not respect the principles of freedom of speech. It is unjust to
assume that regular citizens lack the knowledge or insight to contribute to the public discourse on various
topics, including those on which they possess industry expertise.

The proposed legislation presents a significant risk in undermining the power of the internet, which I
believe is the most powerful democratic invention ever created. The internet has allowed regular people
to have a voice and participate in shaping our democracy. This bill threatens to disproportionately harm
ordinary individuals who rely on the internet to engage in open and honest discussions.

The excessive fines outlined in the bill will undoubtedly lead to an environment where digital services are
more restrictive of speech than they currently are. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the code
applies to the entire industry without any mechanisms for relief or flexibility. This lack of escape valves
further restricts freedom of speech in an already constricted digital landscape.

The task of accurately determining what is true or untrue is impossible. History has shown that what was
once considered widely accepted fact can later be proven false due to new information and discoveries.
The examples listed in the text demonstrate the fluid nature of knowledge. Subjecting information
providers to potential fines for disseminating information that was considered true at the time but later
found to be false stifles the progress of knowledge and the ability to engage in open debates.

Furthermore, the bill does not target only provably false information but also includes true information
that is deemed "misleading" or "deceptive". Freedom of speech is vital as it allows for open and honest
discussions, even when perspectives differ. It is through these discussions that common ground and truth
can be found.

The government must also consider the implications for the global digital landscape. For instance,
platforms like Mastodon, which are attracting users seeking alternatives to platforms like Twitter, would
be subject to compliance with Australian industry codes. This requirement raises questions about
international enforcement and the potential blocking of Australian users, limiting their access to diverse
social media networks based on legal risks.

The bill delegates legislative power to private entities, effectively abdicating the legislative power of
Parliament. This delegation violates constitutional freedoms, including the freedom of political
communication and freedom of opinion and expression. These freedoms are crucial for a functioning
democracy and should not be curtailed by legislation.

By categorizing certain political party viewpoints as misinformation and authorizing their removal from
digital platforms, this bill undermines the democratic process itself. Voters will be deprived of access to
information necessary for making informed decisions. Independent media organizations, journalists, and
bloggers will face complex reporting standards and harassment through misinformation reports, while
government-approved journalists will benefit financially.

Australia's commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to freedom of
thought, conscience, religion, and freedom of opinion and expression, should not be undermined. It is
crucial to consider diverse viewpoints and allow for legitimate discussions on matters of public policy and
scientific investigation.

This bill lacks consideration for the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians and assumes that

the government and accredited institutions hold the authority to determine what is true. Diversity in
viewpoints is essential for the sense-making process, allowing for all possibilities to be considered.
Silencing or categorizing certain views as misinformation or disinformation before they can be shared
hinders this process and disempowers ordinary citizens.

I firmly believe that as a society we should direct our efforts and energy toward healthy, respectful
debate, discussion and sharing of information. Ideas when shared can be transformative in the best
ways. Good ideas and truth have a way of "rising to the top", like the cream in milk. Bad ideas,
information and hateful attitudes likewise tend to fall away and be ignored by the majority who are pretty
good at discerning truth from lies. This draft bill would stifle or, I fear, destroy this natural and healthy
way of the growth of knowledge and information.

The threats outlined in the bill, directed towards both digital platform providers and ordinary users, further
erode trust in the democratic system. Imposing negative records, burdensome reporting requirements,
and civil penalties on platform providers damages their reputation and financial stability. Subjecting
individuals to ACMA hearings and potentially forcing them to report on friends and family is reminiscent
of oppressive regimes, or Orwell's novel 1984.

In conclusion, I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,
Communications and the Arts to reconsider this draft bill. It not only undermines freedom of speech and
democratic values but fails to account for the complexities of information dissemination and the potential
for stifling diverse perspectives. It is crucial that legislation supports, rather than restricts, the democratic
process and the freedom of expression and opinion that Australians hold dear.

Yours sincerely,
Alan Williamson
