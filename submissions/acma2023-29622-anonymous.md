New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

Why is it important to have uncensored speech?

1. Without the freedom to promote a thought or hypothesis there can be no checks and

balances. If Copernicus had been silenced when he first put forward his concept of a solar
system, we could still be geocentric rather than Helio centric in our understanding.

2. A truth can become misleading and even damaging or harmful if it is not given context or a

more complete truth. For example; it is true that large numbers of people die in bed but that
does not mean that one should not spend a significant number of hours in a 24hr period
sleeping in a bed. Citizens should be free to make their own judgements.

3. Where ideas are silenced, tyranny prevails. Nazi Germany and Mao’s China are examples

from recent history.

4. All of science is based on observable facts/truths which cause people to draw conclusions

but until all or more observable facts come to light the conclusions may indeed be false,
misinformation or disinformation.

5. Some people find freedom and pleasure in the belief that their life on earth is the only true

reality while for others their faith in a sovereign God is intrinsic to their health, moral
compass and well-being. It is not the place of government or media outlets to prevent a free
flow of these notions in the public arena.

By silencing different or even opposing views by labelling them misinformation or disinformation it
presumes that one select group of people have all knowledge of truth while others don’t. Aside from
being supremely arrogant, this inhibits growth and development in all areas of society; science,
health, civilian life, spiritual understanding and relationship building. History is full of examples at a
governmental level of actions taken based on a considered “truth” which later turned out to be
inaccurate after more information comes to light or populations intervened to rectify the situation.

Humility in leadership is far more respected than arrogance.

Offense taken because of another’s statements, regardless of their validity, is a sign of immaturity or
insecurity. However, to be challenged to substantiate a viewpoint can bring correction, refinement,
or confirmation.

ACMA should not be given any powers to enforce expanded codes of conduct.

ACMA should not be concerned about gathering or judging what might be deemed misinformation
or disinformation. Only information that leads to criminal activity should be gathered, judged, and
investigated.
