# Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023

I’m an Australian wife and mother of two adult sons, who are happily married, giving us 5
grandchildren in total. I’m interested in my country and the way our government is running it.
That’s why I’m writing this submission. I’ve tried to look at the fact sheets and come up with my
ideas.

First of all I want to say that I am not happy with this Bill and I am asking you to withdraw this
**draft Bill.**

I am not happy with these things from the Fact Sheets…

Pg 6 “ACMA would have a range of enforcement powers to ensure the digital platforms providers
comply” – I feel that this gives ACMA too much authority.

Pg 8 “The government is committed to achieving a balance that upholds the rights and freedoms
of Australians whilst protecting Australians from serious harm that can come from the spread of
misinformation and disinformation” – I don’t feel that you have really explained what this serious
harm is??? We have been used to sharing our thoughts on different subjects. Some people agree
with us and others don’t. It seems that the government is wanting to shut down our freedom of
speech and discussion.

Pg 8 says that you “can’t disclose private messaging” – but I feel that once you start to regulate
people’s opinions and comments you would go on to meddle with people’s private messaging.

Pg 9 “ACMA would have no role in truthfulness” – well who would set the standards of
truthfulness? I want to preserve my freedom to continue proclaiming and living by God’s truth in
Australia. In fact in the Bible in John 14:6 “Jesus says, I am the way, the truth and the life, no one
comes to the Father except by Me”. I do not believe that everyone can have their own truth!

Pg 9 “ACMA could make a standard” but these people have not been elected by us to govern our
nation. They are being given too much power in this Bill without transparency or accountability.
Who would be the fact finders? – left wing motivated people?

I want to remind you of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19.

“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference…”

I do not feel that you are considering this in your proposals.

I want to say that this Bill promotes the overreach by the government leading to an authoritarian
power and eroding democracy. In fact saying that the government authorised content is free from
the censorship regime is hypercritical and inconsistent leading to one rule for government and
another for Australians in what they say.

In conclusion I want to repeat that I am NOT happy with this draft Bill and I want it withdrawn.

Mrs Ruth Crowe
