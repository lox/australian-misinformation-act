Re:

New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

SUBMISSION

I am vehemently opposed to this Bill. If passed in its current form, this law would render Australia’s
commitment to freedom of speech and expression useless.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 19 says that everyone should
have the right to hold opinions without interference, and everyone shall have the right to freedom of
expression, which includes receiving and imparting information of all kinds, through any media of
his/her choice.

Over the last three years of the pandemic we have seen the suppression of free speech and
expression in the mainstream media and on social media. This suppression of free speech and
information – with the labelling of it as misinformation or disinformation - is in violation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Passage of this Bill would further erode our
human right to freedom of speech and expression and access to information of all kinds.

Over the last three years we have seen the censorship of information from world-renowned, highly
published, respected, frontline, experienced scientific and clinical medical experts with no conflicts
of interest. The role of conveying public health information has been usurped by bureaucrats and
governments.

If this Bill is passed, I believe the resultant censorship will further erode the public’s collective trust in
government and authority and be the death knell to democracy in Australia.

Sincerely

Concerned citizen
