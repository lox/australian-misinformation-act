# This bill must be SCRAPPED.

Submission by Helen Nandlal Bsc.Hons

Why?

1. More openness, not less, is needed in our society. Governments above all other organisations

must disseminate the information they generate freely and openly without redaction.

Misinformation spreads when information is withheld (including by governments). Rather than

shut down debate, encourage debate.

2. If you are serious about combatting misinformation, put money into teaching people how to

find reliable information (such as in PubMed), how to find the source of information, how to tell

if the source is suspect or not (even if it is presented within a journal article, such as recognising

conflict of interest), and how to examine the information. It is clear from the COVID narrative

that sustained, intensive, long-term messaging by government can change people’s behaviour (to

get them to even do things contrary to human decency), so use this for good and educate people

about how to tell fact from fiction.

3. The government should not be exempt! The government has exempt themselves from

prosecution in this bill, and well they would, as history shows us that the government has spread

misinformation (and engaged in disinformation?) many times, and only corrected themselves

following intense protest by those who would (if this bill were in operation) be prosecuted and

silenced. Government’s “facts” have been shown time and time again to be wrong and in many

cases damaging. Change begins when a few people question and disseminate what would be

called in this bill “misinformation”. Here are only a few examples:

  - Aboriginal people were not permitted to vote by the government, and they (as fellow

Australians) should be able to vote.

  - Cigarettes were originally touted as healthy by the government, and they are not.

  - Levels of lead in paint were originally allowed by the government to be >50%. Lead is a

potent neurotoxin.

  - COVID vaccine was advertised by the government and mainstream media relentlessly as

able to prevent transmission of the virus and preventing people from getting sick. Both

these assertions have proven to be incorrect.

Overturning all these untruths and many, many others took organisation and protest by groups

within our society. The government didn’t make the changes without many people protesting –

these days it would be largely via social media as mainstream media refuses to report the truth –

and if this bill were to pass all dissenters and platform providers would be committing illegal acts.

4. Who decides what is misinformation? This is not mentioned. All that is stated is that

misinformation is content that contains ‘false, misleading or deceptive’ information. What are the

guidelines for truth? All my examples in 3 above were eventually accepted as right and true. At

what point does an assertion become truth, and how is the evidence going to be allowed to

accumulate when debate and dissemination of evidence will be stifled through this bill?

This bill is an evil overreach of power. It seems designed specifically to silence debate and prevent

education of Australians. It contravenes the human right to freedom of expression and needs to

be torn up and replaced with a bill that enshrines all Australians’ right to free access to

information, whether the government of the day agrees with the information or not.
