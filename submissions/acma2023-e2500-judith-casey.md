 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

**Submission** **prepared** **by:**

E:

There are a number of reasons why I object to this bill.

_1._ This bill is a direct infringement on Freedom of Speech. Freedom of Speech is a hallmark of
a democratic society. Any curtailment of this freedom will inevitably lead to tyranny. Freedom
of speech allows free discourse of ideas which leads to the best ideas rising to the top.
Without freedom of speech there is stifling of the progress of ever evolving science and new
ideas will not be encouraged. Thinking outside the box will be a thing of the past. People will
be afraid to come forward with their ‘cutting edge ideas’ for fear they will be construed as
perpetrators of disinformation or misinformation, especially if it is in opposition to the current
dogma of ‘settled science’.

Intellectual Freedom follows on from this concept. I believe people need access to a wide
range of information, ideas and opinions. There is no need for the government “to play
God” on this issue. Censorship is far more damaging than misinformation and
disinformation. With access to a full range of ideas and information, be it right or wrong,
people are then free to make up their own minds about an issue, which is how it should be
in a democratic society. When governments “play God” and decide what you are allowed to
know and what you are not allowed to know, it smacks of conspiracy to fraud. There is no
transparency. This is the domain of tyrants and the method all totalitarian governments
work from. This is un-Australian.

_1._ Conflicts of Interest: Universities, Hospitals, large Health Institutions and Advisory Agencies
are all subject to financial influence with regards to funding, dependant on their stance on
certain issues. Pharmaceutical Companies have mega wealth and can withhold grants for
research or donations to these bodies and indeed donations to campaign funding for
politicians, if the “right narrative” is not followed according to the pharma company. This is
how conflicts of interest permeate bureaucracies. Financial coercion can ‘pervert the Truth’
so that the financial interests of large companies are put in advance of the welfare interests
of the Australian people.

2. Professional Ethics: It is most important that Medical professionals and alternative health
care practitioners can treat their patients in an holistic and honest manner, upholding the
mantra “to do no harm”. During Covid, APHRA set a ruling that no doctor or medical
professional could say anything negative about the ‘vaccines’ to the patients, or anything
that might deter them from taking the vaccines. This is not following the principles of
Informed Consent. It is widely accepted that any and all pharmaceuticals can have side
effects. It is why there is a pamphlet of information covering this in the packaging of such

outlined in the Childhood Immunisation Schedule as part of the informed consent procedure
required for all vaccines given. APHRA threatened every medical professional with loss of
license and inability to practice, if they did not follow APHRA mandate, rather than the ethical
approach of full informed consent. It put the Medical practitioners in an impossible position.
This is precisely my concern with this Bill. Our Medical advisory bodies have fallen foul of the
law and buckled under the temptation of financial coercion and incentives. The policies they
adopted were dangerous to the health of many Australians and the Vaccine program itself,
was one of misinformation and disinformation. Important information was censored.

3. Costly bureaucracy and Government over-reach: I see this bill as allowing yet another level
of bureaucracy, which is a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer. The funding for this could be
put to better use by improving staffing levels at regional hospitals and much needed
maintenance of regional hospitals, aged care facilities, police stations and the like. The bill is
another example of government over reach: the increasing interference in people’s lives
from government.

4. Compliance costs to small business: Yet another report to write to a government department
to justify that department’s existence. It takes away from the service the business is trying to
provide and is costly in staff time and resources. It is an added burden to business with an
ever present financial threat in terms of what a business can say about the service it
provides, especially if that service is an alternative to mainstream medicine or to big pharma.

I am confident the vast majority of Australians will agree with me, that “Less government
red tape” is what the Australian people want.

It is for the above reasons, that I object to the proposed Disinformation Bill. I pray common sense
and the principles of democracy and decency prevail and that the Bill is dismissed as it should be.
