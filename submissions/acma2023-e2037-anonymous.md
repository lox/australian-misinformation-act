Please reject the current draft of the Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill!

As an older citizen ( years) of Australia I am shocked at this law our government is proposing!

We have been a country of freedom, democracy and diversity of opinions, hard fought and died for

by our ANZACS and others so courageous in protecting our country and others in the past. China’s

leadership would be proud of you! Is the Australian population being conditioned to aid their

takeover?

The Government is supposed to consider and reflect the opinions and needs of their people, not the

other way around. You are here to serve us, not the other way around. You are supposed to trust us

to have varying ideologies and opinions, not impose your ideologies and opinions on us, not even in

the name of ‘the common good’! Diversity means living together with our differing ideas and ways

of life aiming for harmony from the bottom up, not the top down. We do not want to follow the

United States creation of civil unrest by their Government promoting division on many issues.

The mechanism you have chosen to police digital platforms for ‘harmful’ content will be purely

subjective, suiting whatever propaganda the Government wishes to push at the time. No doubt some

global body will have tasty monetary incentives for whatever they decide is ‘good’ for the public.

We have had a taste of this over the past few years, with the response to the ‘pandemic’. The

population was powerfully manipulated by fear tactics and guilt tripping. Compassionate people

were lied to, believing if they didn’t comply, they would be guilty of harming others! Human

freedoms were significantly eroded with negative consequences. One of many, a recent peer

reviewed, high quality study, of Covid Boosters reveals one myocardial injury case per

thirty five administrations! Various studies have shown the lockdowns proved disastrous on many

levels, including economical, morbidity and mortality related. Masks have been shown to do more

harm than good, yet the Government refuses to advise their discontinuation. More seriously, Covid

needles continue to be promoted. The relentless advertising of these needles makes me feel sick!

You know these needles are killing and maiming people! How can we, the people whose welfare

you are supposed to be concerned about, trust you any more?!

Never before have I felt so threatened by my own Government’s ideologies and laws. The World

Health Organisation has an increasing appetite for the power gained over the past few years with

our Government apparently quite happy to acquiesce. Our young and vulnerable people have

bought into the fear and bullying tactics and are far more likely to be compliant, allowing an


-----

authoritarian government to dictate their lives, brainwashed by the propaganda produced by

mainstream media. The tools for this are in the hands of increasingly younger children, in the form

of their mobile phones. A sad era in Australia indeed!

In conclusion, I urge you to shelve this law permanently and allow democracy and freedom of

speech to continue in the way Australians are used to, and the UN Declaration of Human Rights and

the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights call for.
