Who decides what is truth.

I am a pastor. And an Aircraft engineer, a pilot, schools chaplain and a high ropes outdoor Ed
teacher.

Things that are known and obvious to me were presented to the general public out of fear or
speed.
That were wrong.
Always were, always will be.

Yet I almost lost my job over what the health minister came out and appollogised for having told
the public that turned out to be wrong.

Yet what I have know because I am educated in these areas as always true.
Was labelled " mis information"

Now I could be nice and say "the government didn't know enough"
But that does not cut it.

When on power you need to know.
Moving forward what's to stop things that one minister thinks is truth being labelled as " the only
government approved way to think"

Which is essentially what your proposing.
Believe in our version of truth or your Evil.

That's been done before.
I am teaching on W.W.1 now.

Why do we have Anzac day " lest we forget" which as a minister I go to and say the prayer and
hope we learn from it.

If we are just going to do it all over again.
Start removing people's freedoms.

" The government says this is the only thing you can believe"

When the science or truth or knowledge is subjective.

Does the Australian government know everything there is to know about something before it
even happens?

If so the Australian Government believes itself to be God.
Which is heresy.

Consider further this impossible bill, when the health minister had to come out and admit they
were wrong about the affectiveness of the needles.

And the governmental overreach that accompanies it.

Does that mean the government would be mis information sprukers?

Would the government need to put the government in prison??

I say this wanting a free country to remain that way.
Don't be idiots about this.

I come from a faith that says it's the only way. Yet I am accepting of all peoples with any faith or
the faith of no faith.

You need to stop treating people like babies and let them learn.

Education is about presenting all information. Then allowing people to figure out what is right.

When on the past has making something " black market" ever worked?
Never. That's when.

Allow all people to see all information and they can deduce on their own what is actually truth.

Is the government planning to descriminate against people of different faiths?
What about those who believe the earth is flat..are you going to label them as wrong?

That won't help. And is a waste of my tax money.
I don't gives consent for my tax money to be spent on any rubbish bill to restrict freedom or
make Australian education of the population limited to what the government chooses.

My example is all through lock downs the rules changes.
" One shot and done"
"One needle and you can't get it"
"Don't wear a mask or your a conspiracy theorist"
"Do where a mask or your a conspiracy theorist"
Mask stop everything

We never said masks stop everything.
Stay home and it will be over in a fourtnight.

3 months to beat the curve
(3 years later)

3 needles and 5 boosters will make.you healthy.

My kids dental bus has been delayed 3 times as all the staff with needles are out with Covid.

This bill is stupid and close minded.

Back to the drawing board and scrap the whole thing.
