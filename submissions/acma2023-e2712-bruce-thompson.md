### Submission to The ACMA Social Media Censorship Bill Enquiry 2023.8.18

## My Statement

##### The Australian government has over the last 40 years had more trouble with the adverse
 consequences (some catastrophic) due to the misinformation (much of it likely
#### disinformation), than any of the independent media (I mean media that reports on truth rather than cowering to bribes or threats from other entities [unfortunately especially the governments]) or individual people have. The effect of social media has been to enable people who have been already ostracised by the mainline media & the government, who are knowledgeable on truth aspects, to be able to communicate their ideas to the public (= true freedom in speech & ideas).

##### Social media has been a voice for truth, & has to date largely prevented attempts of
#### government to make bad laws to further restrict our freedoms, and has been otherwise a positve input. In effect, social media over this time has been a medium for people to be
##### able to analyse information to determine what truth is, and contrary to government input,
#### most has been of the highest scientific, moral & intellectual quality. The misinformation has
##### easily been shown up its errors, to enable most truth seeking people to gain a better perspective of what reality is & what is occurring.

#### However, as in the process of analysis in one mind to determine truth, so within the public, freedom of social media allows one to analyse various information to determine truth. Without that freedom, the government will have limited the information from which the real truth can be determined, by especially curtailing the input to the vast numbers of public, that the most knowledgeable & bravest advocates of truth can have.

##### As a result, this bill is government restriction of development of truth in the minds of the
#### public, by restricting access, to information, & the experts who devote their time to determining the reality in their chosen field. Thereby this bill is a step towards an Orwellian type facist government that controls people by controlling the truth (ie. designing their
##### preference of what they want people to believe, based on lies, to enable their agenda of a facist one world government, without any recourse for their actions against their own people
#### to get there), and punishing those who own the real truth & try to better the world by telling their fellow man.

##### The government is heading towards a facist totalitarian state, like in George Orwell's book,
#### today with this bill. Like the nazi & stalinist governments of yesterday, which we all agree were evil governments. But what we must understand is that they all started with massive restrictions of freedom of speech (& today social media), & the consequential control of what


-----

##### people believe to be truth, by means of force.

I can only say that this is one of the most evil bills that I have ever seen concocted by the

##### Australian government, and just in case you thought that is might be a coincidence, they
 removed that possibility by introducing this on George Orwell's 120th birthday. I can not

### say it in any stronger terms, please reject this acme social media censorship bill,

##### and ostracise those who concocted it, expose them for who they are, so that we the people

can give them 0 votes at the next election.

##### There should be a law introduced which deals with anyone who tries to restrict freedom of
 the media in such a way, in order to prevent Orwell's totalitarian state ever happenning
 again, regardless of their position in society or in government.

Real Social Media Reform

Obviously, there are many things that mostly large social media has negelcted (or worse) to censor.

Such includes child crime, the live streaming of terrorists, & the Christchurch atrocity. Social media
platforms should rather monitor, detect, and notify police & others, when they see signs leading to such
incidents, like an early warning system. For whatever reason they have failed us, not only as a warning

system, but also in allowing such people to use their services for their own evil purposes. These
failures can probably already be dealt with in the current system. However if necessary, appropriate

laws can be introduced to deal with these incidents & ensure that this is not able to reoccur. But this

should not be allowed to be used as an excuse to have massive government over reach into freedom of

speech, such as the suggested Orwellian laws of acme social media censorship.

##### Historical Context to our Current Delema

Over the last 40 years there's been alot of questionable things that have been done by governments,
which have been backed up by misinformation to enable their action. Many of those who questioned
them with sound argument, were villified and called conspiracy theorists. But what happens when the
outcome is that which was was warned. In reality, the conspiracy theory then becomes the conspiracy
##### truth. But the government, says no, we made a mistake. However, when they try to punish media &

people for telling the truth (eg. Julian Assange, Christine Holgate, Shipton etc.), then they show
effectively what they were pushing was actually disinofrmation, rather than misinformation. Then

because they're the government, & not an individual or company, they can get away with that without
scruitinity. That has to change.

There are so many of these adjustments of the truth to get their 'ends justifies the means' result, by
governments, that it would need a book to cover it substantially.

However, the main bad scenarios which have resulted from government misinformation, much of which
may be disinformation, are listed as follows, and include the following;


-----

1. Privitisation of the 80's & 90's. The result was less employment, great increases in wages of

executives with respect to the average employee (effectively stealing from the company), reduced

services & higher prices for those. It was meant to be more efficient, but it's not, because no or

reduced service & higher prices are much worse than any inefficiency that occurred. Not assessed by

governments or main media.

2. mid 90s. The relaxation of banking regulation & the privitisation of CBA. The CBA funded many
national projects over the history of Australia since its establishment, including the ww2 response, the

Snowy Mountain Scheme, railways, infrastructure & numerous other smaller projects. These were
well planned, completed to a high technical standard, & were mostly completed under budget. Since
the privatisation of CBA, there have been no national projects that have been done at a comparable
technical standard or economy as then, & they are also much fewer. The main issue is that the private

banks don't like long term development projects.

The other aspect, is that the private banks & CBA have become mostly speculative, and of the gambling
type as at the worst end of that, as seen in the 85%+ undisclosed derivatives contracts as a % of their
##### total worth. Banking regulation & the CBA public bank (need for private banks to compete) prevented

this prior to the 90s. Information hidden from the public & only exposed by independent media.

3. The Iraq war. We went to war against Iraq contributing to over a million deaths over a lie, that

Suddam Hussein was in some way involved with al keida & 911, & was amassing weapons of mass
destruction. He actually hated alkeida & 911, & had no mass destruction weapons, the later of which

was shown via the main media. They then said we made a mistake. But when they locked up Julian

Assange, & wouldn't allow fairness, that implies conspiracy. Especially, when the regime change
##### intention of those nations that wanted true independence (ie. independence from globalism, & the nwo,

= post 1983 (here) international reforms) became known, were listed targets. These consequently
faught long unnecessary wars to defend their independence, and those which failed effectively became
failed states, with continued fighting for control. These lies & other lesser ones were responsible for
the situation in Iraq, Libya, & Syria, but also partly for Somalia & Sudan. Reliant on independent media
mostly to ellaborate.

4. The attempted Ban on Cash by the morrison government, only uncovered & opposed by independent
media.

5. The expanded powers to apra bill, which apparently intentionally has a loophole to allow bailin of

bank accounts. Conspiracy was proven, when instead of ammending the bill to disallow bailin, when

One Nation were absent waiting for the ammendment to assess, they cheated, passing it in their

absence on 2018.2.Valentine's Day. Once again only reported by independent media.

6. The support of the maiden coup in Ukraine, & the resultant facist government that persecuted &
warred against all those who disagreed with them. And the millitary support of such a regime when

Russia was baited to intervene, despite potential destabilisation & the risk of ww3 (nb. nuclear ww3 was a risk

ever since the us sponsored maiden coup). Also the disinformation about China and Taiwan, & the resulting
destabilisation of the Pacific. The main media & government narrative here has effectively become a


-----

propaganda machine in both cases. It's no coincidence that Russia & China were at the top of their

regime change list. Only research uncovered & opposed this, by independent media, contrary to the
war support by government & main media, which is based on an incorrect biased narrative.

7. The cv19 response. The allowance of vaccines which were known to be dangerous mrna & dna
injections, which potentially could enable transciption of all one's DNA long term, despite the fact, that

'All the animals died' in experiments of previous years, & apparently dubious short human trials with
adjusted results. Then when the vaccines were shown by statistics not only not to work, but also to

cause, significant vaccine injuries, and a high & increasing excess mortality, thereby becoming (in secret

because of their narrative) much more of a curse than cv19 itself, they mandated them, asking people

choose between their jobs and health (sometimes their life, & that's only so far). All this was enabled

by a strong government narrative & a persecution of those who opposed that for scientifically correct &
##### life moral reasons. We need indepdent media for this.

8. Climate Change. There are many scientific arguments by eminent scientists who have much
greater ability & understanding than those who currently teach us the narrative, that show that the Sun

is the primary control of climate, & CO2 atmorpheric change is simply a very small addition, which is so

small in effect, that it probably can't be practically measured. The real cause of climate change was

established when the good side of the US people published an image from Soho (a satellite that
monitors the Sun) to a public site, which showed a large sphere behind the Sun (Nemesis = Sun's twin

smaller dark sun in our dual sun system) with all its planets & their moons orbiting it, at a time when the
establishment was distracted by a national speech given by Donald Trump in 2020. It was seen to be

so close that it was sucking some of the Sun's atmosphere to itself. That is the likely reason not only
##### for the apparent increase, in the Sun's energy (ie. shorter time to sunburn), but also in geological activity
(earthqukes & volcanoes), & in meteors & fireballs (mostly originating from there, behind the Sun = why
the Chelyabinsk meteor was not detected by nasa). It's not just the disinformation, but also the hiding
##### of all information about what is currently happening with Nemesis, but also historically UFOs &
extraterrestrials from the public. Once again the reason for this seems to be another conspiracy (of

consequences known to them) against us. Nemesis seems to have been there since at least 2018, why

is unknown, possibly locked on the other side of earth from the Sun due to some force (something like
magnetism or static electricity). Nor do we know how it will move in the future, since we have never

observed an object which approaches the Sun, & then locks in an orbit opposite any planet.

Independent media is once again vital in order to obtain information to assess this issue.

All these 7 scenarios should not exist, & only exist because of misinformation spread by the
governments, that was acted upon. And the 8th one should be one which the entire world is preparing
##### for, not co2 reductions & the economic turmoil that that brings, but Nemesis itself, & the changes that that is likely to bring to us (to the extent that that can be predicted). Now when these mistakes are
on the verge of being proven conspiracies based on actual disinformation, they want to protect

themselves from legal & otherwise judgement from their own people that they have directly or
indirectly affected, by defining the truth on their terms, creating laws to persecute those who spread
the inconvenient truth for them. This should not happen, but there should rather be a concerted
##### effort to discover their responsibilites in all these undesirable scenarios, & let the law take its course


-----

(adjusting it as required to get a right outcome).

##### Concluding Remarks

However, If this bill is passed, then there is potential risk of their largely closing down independent
media. Then there is the obvious risk that Australia could continue along that path, to essentially have
the ceasation of freedoms, and become a facist viet state, as the viet continues to battle & scheme
towards an Orwellian facist world government under them.

Please save our independent media, and give our eminent scientists and researchers a decent means to
##### inform the public, so that truth can continue to be obtained from our truth seeking crtical thinkers.

And please save our country from sliding down the path to an Orwellian facist state. To enable these,

please reject this Orwellian acme social media censorship bill.

Please read and act favorably upon my submission,

Bruce Thompson.
