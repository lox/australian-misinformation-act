I want the primary means of information sharing in our current society to remain
relatively sponsorship free and indeed to remain an open market place of ideas so
that we don't fall into corrupt hegemonic ideologies that cannot be shifted or that can
only be governed and controlled by the ruling class the Government.

The Australian human rights commission has as one of it's functions, as one of it's
obligations examining any enactment which means any bill that's to be proposed to
be made law which might impede on Australians human rights which includes any
rights we've covenanted into via international treaties and covenants.
So that's absolutely includes the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of
expression.
The Australian human rights commission has a duty, a statutory duty, to make a
submission to this inquiry and to personally advise the minister and the Government
that this bill should not pass.
It is absolutely way over the top to put it mildly, it is onerous; it breaches the human
rights of Australians.

It's clearly going to create scope for manipulation, control, authoritarian censorship.
It would signal essentially the end of the free marketplace of ideas online.

There is no such thing as a balance of free speech. Speech is either free or it isnâ€™t.
