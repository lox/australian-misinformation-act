Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the Communications

Legislation Amendment [Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation] Bill 2023)

Dear Officer,

The Albanese Government's proposed Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023
threatens the very heart of our democratic rights. It will grant the government the power to define
## truth and empowers regulatory bodies to enforce it, while exempting the government and
mainstream/corporatized media from the same regulations. This Bill will enforce ideological
conformity in Australia and herald in Labour's socialist agenda.

I as a natural born citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia (Un-incorporated) and do not consent
to this Bill, its violations of free speech and call for its immediate withdrawal.

**l.The** **Bill** **contravenes** **ICCP** **freedoms** **of** **speech.**

The Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under
international human rights instruments including the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The proposed Bill is an attack on freedom of
speech that is inconsistent with Australia's international human rights obligations and is out of date
with equivalent European laws. The Bill enables government bureaucrats and tech corporations to
silence and censor speech that goes far beyond reasonable limitation.

The _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation_ _Bill_ _2023_ contravenes our rights to express any form of free
speech and is in violation of Human Rights article 19 to free speech under UN- ICCPR.

_Everyone_ _has_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _freedom_ _of_ _opinion_ _and_ _expression;_ _this_ _right_ _includes_ _freedom_ _to_
_hold_ _opinions_ _without_ _interference_ _and_ _to_ _seek,_ _receive_ _and_ _impart_ _information_ _and_ _ideas_
_through_ _any_ _media_ _and_ _regardless_ _offrontiers._

The scant provisions that are inserted to 'acknowledge' the competing right to freedom of expression
do not meet the gold standard of international law for the interference with fundamental rights of
freedom of expression and is sheer tokenism. Australia is a signatory to UN Charters any human right
violations by our government will inevitably be met with Grand Jury and International Criminal
courts (invocation of Nuremberg Code) in the short-term future.

**This** **Draconian** **Bill** **has** **serious** **ramifications** **for** **religious** **rights** **and** **secular** **aspects:**

The Bill will give government the power to silence or quash religious and political speech that
contradicts prevailing ideologies and political dogma. The Bill fails to include mechanisms to protect
valid expression of opinion and belief or to ensure that there are clear and defined limits on
suppression of speech. On July 4, 2023, a US court shot down the Biden Government's censorship of


-----

free speech as unconstitutional and anti-democracy. The ACMA legislation takes the Biden
administration's approach and likewise should be withdrawn.

**Exclusion** **of** **debate,** **discussion:**

There is the potential to weaponize any form of healthy dialogue or criticism. A healthy democracy

can only be sustainable with the support of its people, e.g. We the people, who hold the government
to ACCOUNT through dialogue, debate and impartial voting system, not through an arbitrary
unelected body such as ACMA and other pay rolled entities such as AHPRA and the TGA- ( re:

Hansard : -Page 7, Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee- Parliament of Australia

             - Senate August 3, 2023): Senator ANTIC: 'Our therapeutic goods association derives something in
the order of 96 per cent of its budget from industry fees. What amount of funding does Pfizer
provide to therapeutic goods association per annum?' This was taken on notice by Dr Hewitt.

**2.** **The** **Bill** **has** **inconsistencies,** **privacy** **issues** **and** **opaque** **definitions-** **harm,** **disinformation,**

**misinformation?**

## • The Bill includes a vague and ideological definitions of the five forms of "harm"
which risks it being weaponised to shut down legitimate speech on pressing social

issues. The government already has legislation and policing to protect the public
from 'harm'- hate speech, civil and criminal crimes, counter -terrorism tools to
defend national and international threats (AFP, ASIO/ 5 Eyes agencies)

## • The Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and private users of digital
platforms to provide information and evidence about misinformation and
disinformation- this is a disturbing breach of privacy.

## • The Bill appears analogous to the US Smith-Mundt Modernization Act which has
overarching powers and consolidation. This Bill will reflect the US style of selectivity
and conformity of journalistic content thereby quashing any independent critical
thinking/ expression. This is the same script MSM one size fits all apply to according
to their corporatized Mockingbird formula.

**S.The** **Bill** **will** **open** **the** **path** **to** **authoritarian** **censorship** **with** **zero** **accountability** **or** **transparency**

**from** **the** **creators** **of** **this** **Bill:**

## • The Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in the
public forum without transparency or accountability. The Bill is a blatant tool for Government
overreach of dissemination of information and censorship. This will open the pandora box to
State/Government sponsored misinformation, disinformation or simply but           - propaganda.
Australians could potentially be "propagandized" by their own government. Falsehoods are
now surfacing in Senate Select committees and the need for COVID 19 Pandemic Response

Royal Commission to expose the deliberate suppression of critical information to the public.

## • The Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 has potential serious conflicts of interest
inherent in its formula.

## • The Bill does not require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable for
excessive and onerous policing of legitimate speech.


-----

## • The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse of

censorship powers. For example: Amendment 7 (2) (e) states "the person disseminating, or

causing the dissemination of, the content 'intends' that the content deceive another

person." How will the arbiter interpret the "intention" of the person disseminating content?

How does ACMA determine if the person disseminating intends to deceive another person?

How will this be achieved?

## • ACMA also have the potential impose their own vague 'standards' through interpretation of

the Bill/Act, thereby by-passing industry 'voluntary' codes and enforcing infinite censorship

possibilities and penalties should it see fit, see **Interaction** **with** **the** **voluntary** **code:** _'If_ _the_

_ACMA_ _were_ _to_ _register_ _a_ _code,_ _then_ _it_ _would_ _need_ _to_ _draw_ _upon_ _the_ _Bill's_ _definitions.'_

The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and standards and
for failing to provide evidence requested by ACMA is excessively brutal and ensures a calculated blow
on free speech only a step away from China's CCP clampdown on freedoms expressed by political,
cultural, and religious minorities.

Additionally, the Government, MSM- mainstream media, big tech corporations, education, medical
institutions, and other entities saturated mass consciousness through dissemination of dis / mis
information regarding a plethora of State sponsored COVID 19 /SARS -COV-2 disinformation over the
past few years. This information was touted as 'campaigns' surrounding the safe efficacies of
experimental vaccine and mask efficacy, while condemning independent think tanks from medical
and legal associations over the medical tyranny debate ,supressing public access to off- label
pharmaceutical and other antiviral treatments, especially the renowned Ivermectin ( which is now no
longer the boogieman)and supporting the MSM narrative regarding the dubious origins of SARS         -

COV-2 . These State sponsored entities had carte blanch access to broadcast their messages and
'campaigns' (which included divisive antivaxxer rhetoric from State politicians- CMO's) on MSM and
social media platforms, all the while a commercial conflict of interest played out under the blessing
from our Federal and State governments.

Governmental intervention on social media platforms has been exposed on Facebook with the
suppression of protest and interest groups posts deleted, this was a stealthy violation under the
Morrison Liberal Government and will also allow current and future Governments to supress free
speech via social media platforms. Moreover, the Morrison government during the COVID 19 period
(one-man National Cabinet) sought to gag all contrary Covid 19 information from the public through
its involvement with other media outlets through censorship or ridicule of contrary viewpoints. The
latest Senate Committee Education and Employment Committee August 3, 2023, has identified the
lack of information that existed between the government and the TGA surrounding the COVID 19
trial drug 'campaign' whilst blindly supporting pharmaceutical industry claims of prevention of
transmission and overlooking safety protocols not privy to the public- (refer to Hansard- Senate
Education and Employment Legislation Committee- Parliament of Australia        - Senate August 3, 2023):
Senator RENNICK:....... 'According _to_ _the_ _Pfizer_ _non-clinical_ _report,_ _there_ _were_ _no_ _carcinogenic_ _tests,_
_no_ _genotoxicity_ _tests,_ _no_ _immune_ _toxicity_ _tests,_ _no_ _interaction_ _studies_ _with_ _other_ _medicines_ _and_ _no_
_longitudinal_ _studies._ _I_ _note_ _that_ _in_ _regard_ _to_ _pregnancy_ _and_ _lactation,_ _studies_ _were_ _conducted_ _on_ _rats._
_How_ _can_ _Pfizer_ _say_ _that_ _the_ _vaccine_ _was_ _uneguivocally_ _safe_ _without_ _gualifying_ _any_ _risks_ _around_ _the_
_vaccine?'_


-----

This continuity of State sponsored dis/mis information under this horrific Bill, will nonetheless go
unchecked and unpenalized, free of accountability under the rigors of the Bill. Only allowing
corporatized MSM dissemination of information which can only be perceived as part of labour's
Orwellian socialist agenda for control under the guise of the 'Ministry of truth'.

**4.SUMMARY**

The Albanese Government has no legitimate right to even entertain this notion of authoritarianism

with such a body as ACMA upon its own populace. A Government or Government entity which is a

centralised authority who determines what is true or false becomes a dictatorship (Government will

be your central source of truth). This shameful piece of intended legislation must be consigned to

the rubbish bin of history. Any idea of Australia being the 'fair go' country will be pure mythology to

our future generations. Remember the ALP built is foundation on free speech through the actions of

real men, shearers. Go back to our roots and take stock as the path the ALP Government now

embarks on will have significant repercussions to our cherished freedoms under our Westminster

system. The Australian populace and international community will in time gradually acknowledge

your erroneous dystopian Bill as sheer folly. Please reconsider this Bill and save Australia from any

## further international embarrassment. The bill serves to support only the corporate 'chums' of the

Government while supressing the will of its own people. This Bill further highlights Labour's socialist

agenda of conformity and unfortunately many honest hard-working Australians will be blindsided by

Labour's Marxist vision of a post-industrial dystopian Australia.

I do not consent to the ACMA Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023 which will silence free

speech in Australia. In the words of John Adams- 'There are two ways to conquer and enslave a

nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt'.

Yours sincerely,
