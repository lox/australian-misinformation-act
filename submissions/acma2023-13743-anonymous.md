# Statement of Opposition to Proposed Bill “Communication Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023”

I totally oppose the proposed bill. There is no one person or group of people who hold the truth, and
therefore determine if something is misinformation or disinformation. Most topics are nuanced and
therefore cannot be categorically stated to be true/false. And just because some idea is popular
doesn’t mean it is true. The whole idea of some group being in charge of what is misinformation or
disinformation is to allow and in fact encourage corruption and control of the narrative in this
country. ‘Fact checking’ is always partially opinion – partly because the fact checkers are also partial.
I have seen multiple fact checked articles that are deceptive or misleading in themselves because
they make assumptions and misinterpret things stated in original article, either accidently or
deliberately. This Bill is therefore, whether intentionally or not, an attack on free speech.

In the fact sheet it is asserted that: “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety
and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our democracy, society and economy.” I could not disagree
more with this statement. There is no danger in information. Information that is absolutely wrong is
easily disputed with reasoned arguments and other than that any discourse that includes a variety of
perspectives is very healthy – it encourages you to think and builds personal resilience – both of
which are important for mental health.

As far as our democracy is concerned, the preservation of free speech is paramount for maintaining
our democracy – there is no democracy if the citizens are not free to speak their mind, or if they do
not feel that it is acceptable to. Any attempt at “Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation”
will inevitably reduce or remove freedom of speech - It will involve a group of people deciding what
is acceptable and what is not.

The wellbeing/safety of society is not served by silencing people and/or making them too scared to
speak up when they disagree for fear of saying something that is considered mis/disinformation on
social media. They will not feel free and their trust in their neighbours, friends and Governments will
be eroded.

Of the Bill there is one clause that I find even more troubling than the rest. That is 6 (1) (c ) - To
allow the possibility that some organisation could be exempt from the law is not equitable and
allows for misuse and corruption. A minister could exempt a service which is putting out particular
information to the benefit of that minister, or that political party, or of a third party who is willing to
pay enough to obtain an exemption. This would particularly by a threat to political balance which
has already been reduced due to media bias.

Finally, I would like to comment on the use of the word “hatred” that seems to have taken on a new
meaning, for how can anyone know if something was said out of hatred (since this in an internal
motivation), unless it was a personal targeted abuse which is already not allowed by our current
laws and has nothing to do with misinformation. To remove a discourse because someone or some
group claim it is hatred is unjust.
