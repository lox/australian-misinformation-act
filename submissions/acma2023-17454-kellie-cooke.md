How will ACMA determine what is misinformation and disinformation?

The past 3 years have shown the Australian Public just how much misinformation and disinformation
the Australian Government and State Governments pushed with regards to Covid-19 and the “Safe
and Effective” Vaccine. I personally know so many people that have injuries and who know’s what
the effects in years to come.

Let’s have an enquiry into the Pandemic and see who was spreading misinformation and
disinformation, the scare tactics, the media and it continues.

Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter last year and released internal company documents to chosen
journalist suggesting what they claimed was collusion between company and government officials.

Why should the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) a government department
have the power to determine what is misinformation and disinformation?
Who determines the facts and how do we know the fact finders are not being paid to sway the facts
in the way the Government want them too?

Where are they getting the facts from? The World Economic Forum or the World Health
Organisation? These entities are not our elected government, and it would appear our government
is just another puppet following their instructions like the rest of the world.

I do not support Bill it is a breach of our democratic rights to freedom of free speech.

The Australian public are waking up to what is going on.
