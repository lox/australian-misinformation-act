### With respect to the proposed legislation by the Australian Labour Party to prevent "disinformation" and "misinformation" - this should be strongly opposed in all forms, and never brought to the fore again.

Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right. Everyone has the right to say what they want and
reciprocally everyone else has the right to say what they want including in response to that person.
The over sensitive culture is beyond rational and does not creating a better more discerning world. It is
### creating a superficial world where people are shallow and prone to easy influence - which is what our current governments (both sides) appear to be driving. The old saying sticks and stones may break my
bones but words will never hurt me never has a greater place in today's world.

Australia is arguably never "more educated" than ever before. Therefore, if my tax dollars are forced to
pay for said education, then my tax dollars should grant me the indulgence that these well educated
people are capable of intelligent discernment of any topic on social media or on any platform. One would
hope with such an outstanding education system that we have all had privilege to access that Australians
### would be exploring all avenues of information open to them to reach a reasoned opinion on any topic.
Citizens should be afforded access to all information     - not a bias narrative dictated to by the government
### or by government agencies. This is a dangerous Orwellian scenario which was well played out in
1930s/1940s Europe, and in latter history in other countries via communist or other totalitarian regimes.
No government has the right to impose a "ministry of truth"    - it is subject to bias, corruption, bullying and
### ultimately can be the foundation for years of torment and terror to a country's citizens as many modern history events have evidenced.

Critically, the key misinformation spread over the last 40 years but notably the last 3 years has been by governments
including Australian. It is against the Constitution that any legislation carve out consequences for a select few of a
nation     - nevermind the biggest risk of proponents of disinformation.

No Australian government has any right at any time to even contemplate these laws. If any Australian
### politician supports these laws they should be treated as a traitor and never be allowed to represent an
Australian citizen again. It is clear that the current government is driving an agenda to suppress the rights
and freedoms of all Australian citizens by suppressing access to information it chooses to disagree with.
This government and any politician supporting this legislation should come clean with the agenda they are
subscribed to.
