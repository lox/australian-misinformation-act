This proposed Orwellian legislation effectively establishes a government
“Ministry of Truth” to decide what is real and what is false, and will punish online platforms if they allow unsanctioned material to be published.

This a grave threat to democracy and freedom of speech, because any opinion
contrary to government narrative can be stifled and the holders of such opinions
can be cancelled. Meanwhile the government and corporate media, who have
been some of the major purveyors of falsehoods in recent times, will be
exempted from this legislation.

In a democracy an unelected, unaccountable panel of bureaucrats or “fact
checkers” should not be the final arbiters of what is true or false. This proposed
legislation may be appropriate for Soviet Russia or North Korea, but has no place
in Australia and should be thrown out.
