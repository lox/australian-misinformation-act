Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023)

**Submission**

I oppose any form of censorship so I do not support this legislation for the following
reasons:

           - Australia already has laws in place to protect people from hate speech or threats.

           - This Bill would be an attack on free speech and the contest of ideas.

           - It would be undemocratic and make our government more like other totalitarian
governments around the world.

           - It would be very Orwellian in that there would be a body that determines if
information is true or not (The Ministry of Truth) and not individuals deciding for
themselves what is truth.

           - The answer to controversies scientific, political, or otherwise is not more
censorship but, about more debate.

           - A body such as this would be biased and ideologies would influence any
determinations of what is true or false.

           - Alternative views & opinions could be easily suppressed.

           - Discussions should not be about which ‘opinions’ are right.

           - It would create division in society with hate crimes against those of opposing ideas
more likely.

In conclusion, people should be free to view the evidence for both sides of an argument
and make their own informed choices whether right or wrong. It would be better to spread
the decision-making process to every individual to minimize errors. Everyone in a free
society should be allowed to make their own decisions about what is correct information
and what is not, rather than one governmental body making the decisions. This bill
should therefore be totally repealed.

Kind regards

John Belik
