**ACMA Submission**
**By Christiena Ennis**

The responsibility of a democratically elected government should never include opinion policing and
should instead prioritise nurturing citizen interests, safeguard rights, and foster well-being. The focus
should be on preserving democratic principles and shaping a future where transparency, accountability
and the power of the people prevail. Spying on the citizens of Australia is NOT part of ANY Democratic
process.

When the very essence of free expression is stifled, and our democratic principles are curtailed by
censorship through online surveillance of Australian citizens via the digital platforms that they choose to
interact with, we can wave a fond farewell to Democracy. This Act is the very beginning of dystopia.

**1.** **The definitions of misinformation and disinformation**

The issue that misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, our democracy, society and economy is simply impossible to prove. ACMA is being placed in
the position of “parent” to the citizens of Australia and discounting every citizen’s adult ability to make
decisions for themselves.

According to the Oxford Dictionary, misinformation is

_[“false or inaccurate information, especially that which is deliberately intended to deceive”.](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBiWShdavMlr_6XDQp7OkfdPVjiaHw:1688876976633&q=inaccurate&si=ACFMAn9-5A9OMKPWcg180I9o9MndlKKAExTJ9WgNKEKJ1a_j8yhi9WzXNC935oLChgbdyyou7Huu6P9qnPwZawQ7YREdBrFDdA%3D%3D&expnd=1)_

**Who determines, and How is it determined that any statements, conversation, debate, personal**
opinions and any discussion is “false, inaccurate, or even if something is deliberately intended to
_deceive”?_

Australians enjoy one of the World’s best education systems. Does the Government have so little
faith in its own education system that it cannot believe the recipients of this system cannot make
decisions for themselves?

According to the Oxford Dictionary, ‘disinformation’ is
_[false information which is intended to mislead, especially propaganda issued by a](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBhhAvE-KbCrjJI8ovUSNCtkdcH9KQ:1688877704016&q=mislead&si=ACFMAn_otZSKbpzAqD_RvWk4YSL-zdduNPbtNmSjnsGJ7oWC53JI5O9-SvXQmVPeR_4evts19AXipBCnM6Ur9WjwmiXBdljt9g%3D%3D&expnd=1)_
_government organization to a rival power or the media._

Again, Australian citizens are being treated as fools. Again, the Government obviously does not
consider the ability of its citizens to determine whether they are being misled. Granted, some
genuine disinformation is cleverly disguised, but the Government itself as well as almost every
politician in the Australian Government is guilty of, as a minimum, hiding truth from the public, to
outright lying to the public. Everything that has occurred over the past three years is a testament to
this.

How can we, and why must we, trust unelected bureaucrats to determine what determines
misinformation and disinformation? How is it possible for unelected bureaucrats to determine
whether we are telling the truth or not?

How can we, and why must we, trust artificial intelligence and/or electronic (whatever) bots to
determine what is misinformation and disinformation? How is it possible for unelected AI /bots or
whatever technology being chosen for this travesty,, to determine whether humans are telling the
truth or not? This is too subjective for their understanding. They are not human; ergo they cannot
think as humans, ergo they cannot judge humans. Human expression, human freedom of speech,

should not be the purview of electronic surveillance technology to make judgments on what is truth
and what is not; what constitutes misinformation and what constitutes disinformation.

The proposed powers for ACMA would enable monitoring and increased surveillance efforts from
digital platforms. However, my concerns are how is it determined that disinformation and/or
**_misinformation is/are occurring?_**

Case in Point – the Voice to Parliament issue is the current debate occurring in the Public Space on
all media. The ‘Yes’ group is stating that the ‘No’ group is “spreading both misinformation and
_disinformation” according to Linda Burney, the current Labor Minister for Indigenous Affairs. This_
was publicly rebutted by Senator Price. THIS DEBATE IS HEALTHY! It means we are FREE to
SPEAK and DEBATE and CENSOR according to the dictates of our own thoughts, beliefs and
**conscience. It’s called Free Speech, which should be readily available to ALL citizens. It**
**allows US ALL to have a VOICE, whenever and wherever we choose within the confines of**
**decency and our Laws.**

We currently have the freedom to debate the issues on Social Media such as Facebook etc. This is
**our right to express our private thoughts and opinions to friends and acquaintances and for that**
matter, to anyone in the public domain who wants to join in the discussion/debate. This is healthy!
The depression that will occur in Australian citizenry whose freedom of expression is denied to them
will be found to be unhealthy.

**2.** **The definition of digital platform services and the types of services we propose be subject to**
**the new framework**

If you are going introduce a new Act, then everyone in the industry should be included. All digital
services should be included. A digital platform is the very backbone for operations and customer
engagement. There should be no exclusions. This reeks of selective targeting which is totally antiDemocratic. After all, misinformation and disinformation can and does occur on all types of digital
platforms!

**3.** **how instant messaging services will be brought within the scope of the framework while**

**safeguarding privacy**

Instant messaging should NOT be bought within the scope of the framework. There is sufficient
coverage for scams as things stand now. To go beyond this is an infringement of personal privacy and
amounts to personal surveillance without participant permission. In other words - CENSORSHIP.

**4.** **The scope of the information-gathering and recording keeping powers, which includes the**

**prevalence of false, misleading or deceptive information on digital platform services**

This point concerns me in that information keeping in this sense constitutes anti-Democratic censorship.
Again, who or what determines what is false, misleading or deceptive information on a digital platform?
This leaves the door open to the reliance on artificial intelligence making decisions about human ideas,
emotions and opinions.

The past has taught us that so-called ‘fact checkers’ make mistakes (deliberate or otherwise) that have,
at a later date, proven to be correct. So-called ‘conspiracies’ later emerged as verifiable truths and this
unveils a chilling reality of wrongful deplatforming, discrediting, and defamation.

How can we be certain who is the bearer of misinformation and/or disinformation? By way of example:
the “Covid-19 so-called ‘vaccines’ prevent you from succumbing to the disease”. This was a patent
untruth spread universally by those who had a vested interest in the profits.

Why is “Professional News” exempt? Are they always truthful? Can we totally rely on what they say at
all times? I think not.

**5.** **the preconditions that must be met before the ACMA can require a new code, register a code**

**and make an industry standard**

Public consultation by the industry body or association producing a code must always be a precondition to registration.

**6.** **How the digital platforms industry may be able to operationalise the Bill and various content**

**exemptions (e.g. professional news, satire, authorised electoral content)**

Professional news, satire and authorised electoral content should NOT be exempt. They should be
operating under the same laws as every citizen is expected to.

**7.** **Appropriate civil penalties and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance.**

No comment other than it is a nice little earner for ACMA (the Government). Always Follow The
Mondy.
