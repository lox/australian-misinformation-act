**Subject: Combatting misinformation and Disinformation bill**

First let me state for the record that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia is the WORST government this country
has ever seen and full of liars spreading misinformation and disinformation. In fact when their lips are moving they are lying.
The weakest minded communistic and murderous undemocratic government since federation. Also operating under foreign
influence which this bill seeks to protect from view.

This dangerous unlawful and unconstitutional bill is the last straw for the people of Australia. We know what you are and
what you have done. This bill will hide nothing.

This insulting bill claims to seek to stop “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing
###### of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy” what a joke.

Firstly who asked for it? Because it was not the people of Australia “whereas we the people” is was the WEF inspired
**bureaucrats seeking to undermine democracy and the Australian public, protect parliament from the non-stop war on the Australian**
population being directed by a group of elites and NGOs donating to your political campaigns. We don’t need it thanks we are ok with
stupid people saying stupid things, we can work it out ourselves and have so far.

The Australian Commonwealth, Prime Minister, Health Ministers, State Premiers and bureaucracy Lied repeatedly and spread
**disinformation and misinformation to dupe Australians with no informed consent exposing them to real risk to kill, maim, and**
injure them by injecting MNRA vaccines (poisons) which were untested, deadly and unlawfully administered. They lied and repeatedly
about the danger of Covid19, spread these falsehoods through the legacy media relentlessly. The legacy media, with majority
shareholdings via, and who have a huge vested interest in pushing this bill through to protect its

(i) the Commonwealth;
(ii) a State;
(iii) a Territory;
(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as an accreditor of educational institutions;

(i) by a foreign government or a body recognised by a foreign government as an accreditor of educational

(ii) to substantially equivalent standards as a comparable Australian educational institution;
(e) content that is authorised by:
(i) the Commonwealth; or
(ii) a State; or
(iii) a Territory; or
(iv) a local government.

**_excluded services for misinformation purposes has the meaning given by clause 6._**

**_foreign government has the same meaning as in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975._**

**_harm means any of the following:_**

(a) hatred against a group in Australian society on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation,

age, religion or physical or mental disability;

(b) disruption of public order or society in Australia;
(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local

government institutions;

(d) harm to the health of Australians;
(e) harm to the Australian environment;
(f)      economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the Australian economy

The health of Australians has diminished from the Covid war as has the economic harms diminished peoples lives and livelyhoods.
Public bodies are not exempt from Justice and scrutiny, and our constitution allows as much information as we want under
FOI act. Australians have a right to free speech, assembly and air grievances in the public square. We don’t need your nanny
state censorship which up to now has never been an issue. Pornography, violence and all manner of degrading things are
found on the internet and the Australian Government don’t care a hoot. So don’t pretend this is some caring Bill to protect
people from harm.

I should also ask which Royal Assent this act pertains to get? There is no Queen or King of Australia. Our constitution 1901
states that Royal Assent can only be given by his Majesty King Charles of United Kingdom, not a fake dead entity corporate
King.

I strongly oppose this disgraceful Bill and any person who crafted it.
