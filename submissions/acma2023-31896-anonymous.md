Censorship and silencing of ideas that differ to the official stance of government will s�fle innova�on
and growth in our na�on. Imagine if the ideas and inven�ons which have led to forms of alterna�ve
energy or new medical treatments had been censored, simply because they were not the same old
ideas. New ideas and innova�on do not just come from Government-approved “experts”,
Government-approved Universi�es or Government-approved media. Innova�on comes from the
people. Censorship of alterna�ve ideas and opinions is a dangerous, backward step for a country that
intends to grow and mature in its development.

I ask, why would a free, democra�c, and educated na�on, like Australia, need this kind of
censorship? Silly ideas, false ideas, even dangerous ideas have always existed, but the Australian
government has never felt the need, before now, to “nanny” its ci�zens and “hide” these ideas.

Australians are intelligent enough to discern the truth from mis or dis informa�on, if given the
opportunity, and they must not have this opportunity legislated away from them through censorship.
This kind of censorship of anything besides the government’s voice is characteris�c of a dictatorship,
rather than a democracy. Australians do not need poli�cally mo�vated “experts” to tell them how to
think. If the government’s message is truth, then it will speak for itself and need not fear compe�ng,
dissen�ng, or differing opinions.

The only real reason Australians would turn to the opinions of others voiced on social media is
because they have lost trust in the voice of their government. This trust cannot be restored through
censorship of differing views. The government must earn this trust through enabling complete and
u.er transparency, and con�nued freedom of speech and opinion.

Please reject the Communica�ons Legisla�on Amendment (Comba2ng Misinforma�on and
Disinforma�on) Bill 2023.
