# Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023

This is a supplementary submission to my previous submission, due to new evidence relevant to this
legislative amendment has just been released in the ABC Ombudsman Report.

My previous submission argues that the proposed amendment is inappropriate to the role of ACMA as
an infrastructure regulator. The proposed new powers for combatting misinformation and
disinformation are inconsistent with a democracy which must allow dissenting views to be expressed
and discussed freely.

This supplementary submission points out inherent flaws and contradictions in the exposure draft’s
definition of “excluded content”.

In the exposure draft, (p.6 & p.7), ACMA would apply the definition:

**_excluded content for misinformation purposes means any of the following:_**
_..._
_(b) professional news content_
_..._
_(e) content that is authorised by:_

_(i) the Commonwealth; or_
_(ii) a State; or_
_(iii) a Territory; or_
_(iv) a local government_

That is, content published by professional news or various levels of government, will not be
considered as misinformation. This assumes and implies excluded content is information, which is
not necessarily true.

For example, the ABC Ombudsman has just released a six-month report for 2023 disclosing 1,500
complaints on ABC content, of which the 535 were investigated, 120 or 23 percent needed remedial
action or found to have breached editorial standards.

[I have personally published an article exposing ABC misinformation during the COVID pandemic.](https://principia-scientific.com/lies-damn-lies-and-covid-statistics-in-australia/)

What happens when readers and citizens question or discuss excluded content for their
misinformation (which "contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive")? How can
misinformation of excluded content be discussed using digital services?

The legislation is poorly considered and should be withdrawn without further amendment.

Yours sincerely,
Dr Wilson Sy
