Dear Sir/Madam,
I write to express my (and my families) absolute opposition to this proposal.

There is no such thing as "misinformation" or "disinformation". There is only "information" and if anybody thinks that
information is wrong then the way to address it is by providing "better" information or "correct" information and
protecting the right of citizens to make up their own minds.

Information, whether correct or not, is not a threat to the safety or well-being of Australians. But this Bill certainly is.
It's called the sanctity of free speech and without it there can only be tyranny.

Yours sincerely

Bernie Franke and Famil
