During the past few years during the pandemic, the government has been the biggest contributor to
disinformation (eg. 'safe and effective'). Why should we allow you more powers to exert your
authority, monitor and censor what you claim to be disinformation or more aptly put, information
against your narrative? The Australian government is in all aspects of our lives, placing onus on
industries report and monitor our activities - we are becoming more like communist China everyday.
Who is policing your information â€“ where are the safeguards? Also, why is Julian Assange still behind
bars when all he has done is expose criminal activity?

I DO NOT consent to this bill.

BTW, I like how you have Australian Privacy Principle at the end of this survey, is this a joke? We all
know the government allowed employers, businesses and state governments to collect private
medical information / vaccination records.
