I am concerned that PM Albanese and Labors Misinformation Bill contradicts our rights
under the Australian Constitution

In Australia you have a right to hold an opinion, Article 19(1) Australian Constitution, and
Article 19(2), protects freedom of expression in any medium, written and oral,
communications, media, public protest, broadcasting, artistic works and commercial
advertising. You have the right to form and hold an opinion and you have the right to express
that opinion.

The Albanese government is currently seeking powers to “hold digital platforms
to account for harmful misinformation and disinformation online.” By this sleight
of hand they can claim that they are not empowering bureaucracy to determine
what is true or the power to censor individuals. They are only threatening Big
Tech, not us. They are expecting Big Tech to threaten us, censor us, punish us
and deplatform anyone if they speak against the government approved
information – but it is not technically the government punishing you directly. The
government will bring a big stick to Big Tech if Big Tech doesn’t keep you in line.

Yet even without this proposed legislation, that is exactly what the Department
of Home Affairs admitted to doing in recent years. The Australian government
interfered more than 4,200 times to censor opinions – many
eventually substantiated – which merely disagreed with official government
propaganda.

Would critical commentary of the claims that Saddam Hussein absolutely
definitely had weapons of mass destruction justifying the invasion of a foreign
country by Australia among others have been labelled “misinformation” by the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).

Would ACMA have ordered social media posts disputing that refugees ever threw
the children overboard as falsely claimed again by the Howard government have
been censored as disinformation because they disagreed with government
experts?

Will preachers who publish videos of their scriptural sermons or Christians
commenting accurately on God’s design for gender and sexual ethics, and the
medical and emotional consequences of transgressing those boundaries, come
afoul of Big Tech knives freshly sharpened by the looming threat of new
government powers?

I have no confidence in a government which demands the power to deplatform
or punish citizens who debate the government-approved opinions.


If freedom of speech is valued then this Misinformation Bill must be rejected.
