Dear Member of Parliament,
I am writing to express my serious concerns with the proposed misinformation and disinformation bill. I consider this
bill to be egregious in nature and a grave threat to free speech. The issue is that the government and large media
bodies would have the power to decide what information is correct. This is heavily biased and unjust. It is not
appropriate for the government to censor public debate. This means that Australians would not be capable of
presenting a view that the government disagrees with. That is very dangerous. For society to develop good ideas for
the many, it is imperative that free speech in debate can take place, without threat of consequence. People could be
penalised for saying very reasonable things, because the government's official stance is different. History has clearly
shown that government does not always maintain the same viewpoint regarding misinformation. Laws can never
change for the better if free speech criticising them cannot safely take place. It means well-thought debate
surrounding major moral issues cannot take place.
To conclude, I ask that you vote against this dangerous bill. It undermines free speech and democracy.
Thankyou for taking the time to read this.
Kind regards,
James Browne.
