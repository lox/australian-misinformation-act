Submission re:misinformation and disinformation bill

Australia has some 25 million people of all walks of life, beliefs and traditions. It is clear that there is a
dominant force already being dictated through government, media, education and social media. People,
most especially conservatives, Christians, Muslims and others who hold to strong moral and family
principles which are guided by faith and personal beliefs are being sidelined, gaslighted and ridiculed
already without this bill in force.

Show me in history where government led silencing of free speech has gone well for the people? I cite
China and Russia and North Korea as examples of what you are asking Australians to accept with this bill.

You are asking 25 million people to hand over their freedom of speech to a few hundred unknown
bureaucrats who you have no control over and whom have the power to police and bankrupt free
speech.

This is a shocking bill which reeks of those who seek total power to control the Australian public to the
extent that they will have no voice. People would be afraid to speak at all with this legislation.

It is likely that this will divide the country and force the adoption of alternative media and
communication systems outside government purview. Like water finds a way people will create an
underground society to communicate.

This sounds like communist China. My God what has Australia become.

Stop this insane bill. People of Australia wake up while you still have the right to speak.
