The problem is that the powers proposed in this Bill eventually will be abused and applied for
political gains.

Misinformation and disinformation can be real problems but the proper direction to look for
solutions is solid foundation to have pluralism and environment which supports multiple viewpoints.

The ongoing discussion, debate and comparison of different opinions will allow relatively fair
solutions to be found for the problems we deal with.

These solutions will never be perfect but at the same time the mere fact that multiple perspectives
are being discussed will guarantee that we do not end up with a disastrous outcome.

This will be a self-healing system.

The alternative - introducing a single entity (in this case ACMA) to enforce what is
misinformation/disinformation through standards/codes of practice/etc is prone to huge abuse.

The problem is two fold.

Obviously ACMA could be used as a tool to enforce censorship.

Equally big problem though is the mass collection of data that will happen. Basically, for the average
user of social media almost any content published by that individual can be a target for data
collection (excluding private messages).

This opens the door for numerous ways of abuse based on mass data collection for individuals.

Through my eyes this Bill is fundamentally flawed. It tries to find a solution in a directions which will
create even bigger problems.

Put in other words, we do not need a monopoly in the way we determine what is
true/false/misinformation/disinformation. What we need instead is a healthy
competition/discussions of different perspectives. This will keep the participants in these discussions
fair.

Some other suggestions how to fight misinformation/disinformation...

Often the means to spread misinformatio are through automation. Instead of actual humans who
distribute misleading information it is done by bots/AI/etc in social media.

This means legislation in the following direction can help minimise the impact of bad actors in social
media:

- Creating an account in social media should be done in a way so it guarantees there is an actual
human being registering the account

Or at least it should be possible to tell if an account represents a real person or there is no
information for that. This doesn't mean the identity of the person should be revealed.


-----

- A person should not be able to create multiple accounts under their name

- The social media provider should offer their users the means to tell if certain post/information
comes from human being, automated account/bot or unknown status

- The social media provider should allow their users to filter out content based on human
being/bot/unknown.

Legislation like this will help users of social media to subscribe to streams of information which are
guaranteed to be created by real people.

This can solve problems where flood of information is generated in an automated way for the
purposes of brainwashing/misinformation.
