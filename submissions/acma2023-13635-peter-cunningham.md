# SUBMISSION

 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
 Disinformation) Bill 2023.

  - Always will be lies and deceptions in ANY society.

  - Paramount in a free society are the means to Free speech and argument to counteract.

  - Truth will prevail not from a Government appointed arbiter and more regulations, but
by non-interference.

  - It is NOT the roll of any government or entity to interfere with free speech – irrespective
if “offense” might be caused.

  - Establishing a so called “eSafety Commissioner,” and inevitably a large, expensive
supporting bureaucracy to be the truth arbiter … is both dangerous* and utterly biased.

  - In public circles, any anointed truth can result only after censorship.

  - In government at ALL levels, the same processes and penalties must apply to politicians
and Bureaucrats to always be wholly truthful without omission.

  - Same for mainstream media, but must NOT be applied to the carriers of public discourse,
as they supply the vehicle, but not responsible for how it is used.

  - If that principle of equality is not applied, then this entire effort must be terminated.

# • Therefore, if this assault on liberty is to proceed, will the same scrutiny and censorship
(and with severest of penalties) be applied to the professional liars and manipulators –
Politicians and Bureaucrats and Mainstream Media?
