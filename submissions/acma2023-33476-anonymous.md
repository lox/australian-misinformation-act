# Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

To the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications

and the Arts:

**I** **object** **to** **the** **Communications** **Legislation** **Amendment** **(Combatting** **Misinformation**

**and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023.**

This Bill grants excessive control to Government and its authorities and is highly likely lead to

censorship, similar to what is occurring in past and current Orwellian / Totalitarian regimes.

The basis of this Bill is, in my view, illegal to the lore of this land and contravenes our basic

Human Rights of freedom of speech (include expression, debate, beliefs and opinions)

encompassed in our founding Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia 1901 (UK) that

enshrines in our democracy and Westminster System of Government.

## Alternative approaches should be explored that do not infringe upon freedom of speech and

expression. Censorship and penalisation of the Australian People is undemocratic and illegal

## for Freedom of speech, expression is our Birth rite. Laws that are made that are not inline
 with the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia 1901 (UK) intent1 should not be

considered in an Australian Parliamentary Westminster System.

The proposed Bill undermines the Australian People's 'Freedom of Speech' by attempting to

'balance' that fundamental right with the notion of combating so-called 'misinformation'.

Fundamental rights cannot be balanced against anything, rather they are undermined forthe

People of Australia.

This Bill is discriminatory as it specifically exempts a certain class of Institutions and

Australians from censorship (ie, Government, 'Professional' News and 'Academics') that have

## the ability to create the narrative, public policies, 'mandates' and opinion that has the

 potential to provide 'brutal' harm, deception and misinformation if they do not abide by their

own Industry codes of practice and the founding Constitution of the Commonwealth of

Australia 1901 (UK).

1 The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia 1901 (UK) enshrines the People of Australia's Freedom of Speech
and Expression. Such Freedoms are underpinned by the Magna Carta (1259), the English Bill of Rights (1689) and the
King James bible.

## Determining what qualifies as so-called 'misinformation' is subjective and entrusting a

Government agency (ie, ACMA) to decide truthfulness raises concerns. The Government,

'Professional' Media and certain Academics, in recent years are prone to foreign and

ideological interference to steer a narrative, public policy and draconian 'mandates' which,

in hindsight has not always been in the interests of the Australia's economy as well as the

People of Australia's health, wealth and freedoms.

So-called 'misinformation', unless it incites violence, social and economic destruction, mental

and physical health issues and detrimental decisions that can cause physical health, social,

economic and environmental harm does not cause direct harm, and defining harm based on

subjective criteria is problematic.

I implore the Government law makers to reconsider progressing with this Bill and consider

## alternatives that do not impinge on the Australian Peoples' Freedom of Speech and

expression in our Democracy.

My Submission is with the Australian Public's interest in mind,

20 August 2023
