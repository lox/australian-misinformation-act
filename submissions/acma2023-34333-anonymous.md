# Re: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

As an Australian citizen, I believe that this bill will erode our freedom of speech.

There are many scientists, and experts in every field, whose opinions differ from those of
other experts in the same field. Many times, throughout history, there have been beliefs
that are strongly held as true, which centuries, decades, years, or even months later, are
proven NOT to be true.

Healthy, respectful, and open discussions about any issue MUST be allowed, and we as
citizens of a democratic country, have the right to form our own conclusions about the
issues. We should NOT be prevented from expressing ourselves about any issues, nor be
shielded from differing opinions. Neither should we be forced or coerced into believing
something that is currently believed by the government of the day, just because their
political interests demand it.

I’m sure we could all name countries where this happens, and where there is NO freedom of
speech if it doesn’t align with the views of those in power. I for one, never imagined that we
would be facing such a future in a country like Australia, but I am deeply concerned that this
bill is lurching us headlong into such a future. I demand that the government NOT proceed
down this undemocratic and totalitarian path. I plead with you to protect our freedom of
speech and the values this country has been built on.
