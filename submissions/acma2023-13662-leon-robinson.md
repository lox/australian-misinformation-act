# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?”, 1984,
George Orwell.

Dear government please don’t infantilise me. The new ACMA powers to combat
misinformation and disinformation assumes that ACMA knows what misinformation and
disinformation is. Why use the word combat, what or who is the fight with, the truth, whose
truth. Is it a truth that is not conforming to the present government narrative. As we have
seen the narrative changes depending on the latest news poll. Recently what was once
considered misinformation or disinformation is now the truth. I don’t want ACMA protecting
me. If you feel that I am not educated enough to make my own judgement, wouldn’t it be
better to educate me than to merely tell me what the answer is.
