Regarding: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023)

To the submissions officer,

I understand this bill to allow ACMA to indirectly curate and censor content through it’s code and
standard making powers which supports government and other authoritative institutions in their
efforts to protect Australian citizens from harm. I believe these powers in their current iteration as
presented in the exposure draft have the potential to do more harm than good. They undermine the
necessary legal due process when there is a discrepancy between public opinion and the positions of
our authoritative institutions. The definitions provided lack the clarity required to protect freedom
of speech and expression while minimising harm from disinformation.

Further separation between the terms misinformation and disinformation are required. The bill
describes that disinformation is disseminated with an intent to deceive or cause harm, it has an
antisocial nature and can perhaps tighter regulations when there is a potential for harm.
Misinformation on the other hand is poorly defined and understood, the keywords used are false,
misleading or deceptive. Deceptive communication harbours negative and misleading intent and is
more in the realm of disinformation by the bills own definition, that is if we use “intent” to separate
the two terms. Understanding the false and misleading aspects of misinformation is important in
clarifying the exact content that may justify ACMA’s powers.

In regards to “false” information, only a judicial process can determine the fine line between truth
and falsehood and this may take several months at a minimum. What criteria are the ACMA using
to determine what information is accurately reported as false? What checks and balances are in
place to ensure that the review of all reported information is accurate, and the outcome of the
review is consistent regardless of the opinions held by the reviewer? Does the content provider have
to include a clear reference supporting their claims, perhaps from peer reviewed literature, for it to
be deemed accurate and what if those claims oppose government recommendations? Does anecdotal
evidence and the authors own subjective opinion need to be explicitly prefaced as such to avoid any
confusion on the quality of their information? Perhaps tighter regulations surrounding the language
used in social media will inspire greater thoroughness in the spread of information without resorting
to stricter regulatory powers.

Accurate and truthful information which is out of context can be misleading. This aspect of
misinformation can still indirectly cause harm but not due to the intent of the author, as it can be
communicated with sincere and honest intent, but by how it is understood by the end user. This
information is necessary for public consideration. Reviewing it as harmful to the end user and thus
requiring censorship indirectly through the end stage of ACMA’s progressive powers implies that
the ACMA has adopted a single context as the primary truth, which leads us once again to the
undermining of due process. A simple example of de-contextualised truth that I suspect will be
classified as misleading information is, “Non of the COVID-19 vaccines have long term safety
studies”, if spoken soon after their release then the comment is technically accurate as most
pharmaceuticals go through several years of safety testing to be considered safe, yet the comment

undermines the safety testing that has been done through project Warp Speed. This statement can
cause hesitancy and thus harm through under-vaccination during a pandemic but emerging data has
shown that COVID vaccines have a far greater injury rate than that of previous vaccines using
recent TGA data showing the rate of injuries in Western Australia as an example. I understand that
some vaccines have even been removed from the market for carrying lower risks of injury than the
COVID vaccines. So, who determines the ever shifting ethical line between the risk of personal
injury from a product and enforcement of its use through a mandate? Such conversations are a
bedrock for a free and creative exchange of ideas that, despite carrying a risk of harm, provoke both
insight and resiliency through a diversity of thought and action. An unforeseeable future (including
exceptionally poor and disparate epidemiological modelling) necessitates precisely this level of free
speech, which is immediately subverted when attempts are made to exert control over our public
dialogue to preference and overexpose a single message such as “safe and effective”, for this
example.

All three key words attributed to the definition of misinformation are poorly chosen and the
definition lacks the clarity needed to protect freedom of speech. I believe any further substance
attributed to the word misinformation, despite it’s potential to indirectly cause harm, is concretely
within the realm of democratic discourse and creates the necessary friction that allows ivory tower
academics to prove the integrity of their ideas and decisions against public scrutiny. Though I do
agree that there is a line and any anti-social behaviour through the spread of disinformation
harbouring harmful intent should be moderated both to mitigate public confusion and to help
improve the quality of discourse on any given topic.

While this bill claims it is not aimed at curtailing freedom of speech, I suspect it will classify any
oppositional ideas to both the lockdowns and COVID vaccinations as a factor in increasing
disobedience and hesitancy respectively, and thus causing harm to the health of Australians. Many
of the lock down response and vaccination critics such as Peter McCullough, Robert Malone and
Robert Kennedy Jr were figure heads in the rally’s during COVID. They had convincing arguments
which were often well referenced yet they were met with active censorship rather than engagement
which strongly intensified the level of dissent and conversely further propagated much of their
contribution and discourse surrounding vaccination and lockdowns. Was their contribution to the
discourse surrounding COVID helpful in retrospect? I believe this is worth reviewing. A
retrospective review of the accuracy of third party fact checking services during the pandemic will
help inform the extent of ACMA enforcement powers if any are justified at all. Emerging evidence
on the effects of lockdowns as well as COVID vaccine safety and efficacy will indicate whether or
not both have had unforeseen and undesirable outcomes. And perhaps those outcomes have been
effectively tempered by the doubt and hesitancy created by those figure heads. Of course any
review would need to taking into account all factors including increases in domestic violence,
mental health, substance abuse, our economic health, etc. Higher level modelling, analysis and
discussion is essential before insisting on tighter regulations that curtail freedom of speech over our
digital social landscape, with public access to the modelling and data justifying the proposed
ACMA powers for transparency and accountability.

The bill seems intentionally vaguely worded and is absent of the proper checks and balances that
allows it to be used fairly, and instead it just seems to serve as an instrument that only supports the
current government in power and whatever opinion it holds at the time. It has poor implications for
democratic debate outside of authoritative decision making and is leaning towards autocratic forms
of control. Stifling any public concerns also stifles the very feedback that is required to instigate and
refine democratic discourse and policy making. The solution is greater transparency in decision
making with more pressure on those in authority to make better decisions that are easily defensible
against public scrutiny through education, engagement and understanding.

I also strongly support Peter Fam’s submission on behalf of Maat’s Method law firm and
Australians for science and freedom (their submission was made public). Their recommendations
for improving this exposure draft, as well as their opinions, reflect my own.

Thank you for reading my submission.

Kind regards,

29 July 2023
