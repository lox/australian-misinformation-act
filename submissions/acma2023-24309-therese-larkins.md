**Submission Objecting to the introduction of the proposed new misinformation laws**

19/07/2023

I, Therese Larkins, strongly object to the government’s proposed new laws providing the
ACMA with powers to ostensibly combat online misinformation and disinformation.

The proposed new laws contravene:

 - Article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), proclaimed by the

United Nations General Assembly in 1948 in the wake of the holocaust. The UDHR
expressed a commitment by the world to promote and observe a full suite of fundamental
human rights.

`o` Article 19 of the UDHR protects freedom of opinion and expression stating

explicitly that:

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes_
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart_
_information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers._

Importantly, The Australian Human Rights Commission has warned against giving any body
the power to be ‘the sole arbiter of truth’.

Following are several key arguments stating why the legislation would be in violation of this
critical human rights article (Article 19):

**International Obligations:**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a foundational international human rights
instrument. Many countries are signatories to the Declaration, committing to upholding its
principles. Legislation that restricts free speech in the media not only contravenes Article 19
but also raises concerns about a country's commitment to respecting and protecting human
rights.

**Suppression of Freedom of Expression:**

The essence of Article 19 lies in the protection and promotion of freedom of expression.
Legislation that restricts free speech in the media curtails individuals' right to express their
thoughts, opinions, and ideas freely. It undermines the foundation of democracy, where open
discussions, debates, and the exchange of diverse viewpoints are essential for societal
progress and collective decision-making.

**Hindrance to Media Independence:**

A free and independent media plays a crucial role in holding governments, institutions, and
powerful entities accountable. Legislation that limits free speech in the media can lead to
government control or censorship, eroding the independence of journalism. An unfettered
media is crucial for exposing corruption, human rights violations, and other abuses of power.

**Denial of Public Access to Information:**

Article 19 recognises the importance of the public's right to seek, receive, and impart
information. Limiting free speech in the media denies the public access to information and
impedes their right to know. The media serves as a crucial conduit for information
dissemination, allowing citizens to stay informed, make informed decisions, and actively
participate in democratic processes.

**Threat to Pluralism and Diversity of Ideas:**

A diverse media landscape with a wide range of ideas and perspectives is essential for
fostering a vibrant and informed society. Legislation that restricts free speech can lead to
media homogenisation, limiting the availability of different viewpoints and hindering public
discourse.

**Obstruction of Societal Progress:**

A thriving media environment fosters creativity, innovation, and societal progress. By stifling
free expression in the media, legislation impedes creative thinking, hinders the exchange of
new ideas, and restrains the potential for social advancement.

**Potential for Abuse of Power:**

Legislation that limits free speech in the media may be subject to abuse by authorities seeking
to control information and suppress dissenting voices. This can lead to arbitrary application
and punishment of journalists and media outlets critical of the government or those in
positions of power, violating the principles of justice and impartiality.

**Chilling Effect on Journalists:**

Legislation restricting free speech in the media can create a chilling effect on journalists and
media professionals. Fear of prosecution or punitive actions may lead to self-censorship,
compromising the media's role as a watchdog and undermining the public's right to access
information.

**Impact on Media Pluralism:**

Media pluralism is essential for a well-informed society. Limiting free speech in the media
can lead to the concentration of media ownership in the hands of a few, reducing the diversity
of voices and perspectives available to the public.

It cannot be argued strongly enough that legislation that limits free speech in the media
directly contradicts the principles enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. The unrestricted flow of information and ideas through a free media is crucial
for maintaining democratic societies, promoting human rights, and ensuring the public's right
to access diverse information. Upholding media freedom is essential in fostering
transparency, accountability, and societal progress while safeguarding the principles of
democracy and human rights.
