**PART 1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS**

**Introduction**
Firstly, thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this matter by way of this submission.
Making this submission should, of course, be unnecessary. The fact that it is even necessary to write
such a missive in defence of free speech is indicative of the alarmingly low level to which
Government respect for Australian “representative democracy” and “free speech” has fallen. I trust
this and all other submissions supportive of maintaining some semblance of free speech in Australia
will be taken seriously and that the present request for submissions is not just for “show”.

**The premise of this call for submissions**
I would like to start by examining the basic premise of this inquiry.

CLAIM at https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/have-your-say/new-acma-powers-combatmisinformation-and-disinformation “Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the
_safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.”_

That claim is utterly without foundation. Being able to analyse issues and make up one’s own mind
is the essence of day-to-day living in a representative democracy and a free society.

There is no one “single source of truth” contrary to what New Zealand’s PM Ardern infamously
said on March 19th, 2020 for which she was rightly and widely condemned world wide and
extensively mocked. Specifically she said “We will continue to be your single source of truth” and
“Unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth.” It’s difficult to imagine a more Orwellian real-life
statement than that.

People have always had to live with different sources of information and have decided the truth for
themselves. This is easier to do now than ever before, with almost unlimited, unrestricted access to
information on the Internet. Some reliable, some not. But that’s why people are endowed by their
Creator with a brain and we have an education system and for children, parental guidance. This
enables people to distinguish fact from fiction.

Also, if there is only officially-sanctioned information available, it will come to be that people
automatically assume it is true. But often Government sanctioned information or other information
is not true and conversely some information that is claimed to be false is actually true as we shall
show by way of example.

Further on, we will discuss some examples of information that Government and their agents in
legacy and social media falsely claimed to be false when it was actually true.

**One exception to the above – when dis- and misinformation comes from Government**
There is in fact one exception to the above statement. Dis- and misinformation when it comes
**_from Government. The problem with Government dis- and misinformation is that many people_**
regard Government as a credible information source. This can actually be dangerous because it is
assumed to be authoritative plus also Government has the power to suppress alternate, possibly
more reliable sources of information which is in fact what the proposed bill intends to do.

In regard to other sources of dis- and misinformation, there are multiple sources of information and
people can make up their own minds. I don’t see this as a serious problem unlike dis- and
misinformation from Government.

**Origin of this bill?**
The idea for this bill appears to be based upon the US Government’s failed “Disinformation
Governance Board” whose purpose was, much like this bill, was to combat “misinformation,
_malinformation, and disinformation that threatens the security of the homeland”. It was rightly_
likened to Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty Four “Ministry of Truth”, “Orwellian”; as “Unconstitutional”
and “a cautionary note on how dangerously out of touch Washington is” and; a “terrible idea” that
“communicates to the world that we're going to be spreading propaganda in our own country”.
(Reference: Wikipedia.). Not surprisingly, it was subject to enormous criticism, and was a clear
violation of that country’s First Amendment right to free speech and was disbanded after only four
months. Sadly, Australians have no such Constitutional Right to free speech as do American
citizens. Australian Governments have never been afraid to, and often actively seek to adopt the
failed ideas of others, so here we are trying to defend against this sinister legislation….

**PART 2 FREE SPEECH AND CENSORSHIP**

**Its not about free speech, its about dis- and misinformation?**
There may be some semantic games being played by the proponents of this bill, but it is
fundamentally about free speech. Calling what is sought to be censored or controlled “dis-” or
“misinformation” when it is really speech, in all its variety of forms, that is sought to be controlled
is a disingenuous and dishonest word game.

**The legal Right to free speech**
Although Australia has no Constitutionally recognised Right to free speech, the High Court has
decided that there is an implied right to free speech of a political nature. It is not a strong protection.

There is also Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states:

_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes_
_freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart_
_information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers._
_https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf_

**Philosophical basis of free speech**
The principle moral philosopher of the Commonwealth countries is Jeremy Bentham while the US
Founding Fathers sought inspiration from John Locke.

Jeremy Bentham thought people only had rights that came from Government alone whilst John
Locke believed that people had “natural rights” beyond those “granted” by Government.

Despite these differences, both men believed in free speech and freedom of expression.

In “Jeremy Bentham on Freedom of the Press, Public Opinion, and Good Government” by
Philip Schofield in Scandinavica, Vol 58, No 2, 2019,
https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10105424/1/13223-jeremy-bentham-on-freedom-of-thepress-public-opinion-and-good-government.pdf Philip Schofield argues that “Throughout
_his career Bentham placed great emphasis on public opinion as a bulwark against_
_oppression and misrule” and also quotes Bentham “on the liberty of the press; or the_
_security which every man, be he of the one class or the other, may make known his_
_complaints and remonstrances to the whole community: – on the liberty of public_
_association; or the security with which malecontents may communicate their sentiments,_
_concert their plans, and practise every mode of opposition short of actual revolt, before the_
_executive power can be legally justified in disturbing them”._

As argued by Alex Daniel in “Speech Locked Up: John Locke, Liberalism and the
_Regulation of Speech” 2013 https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?_
article=1154&context=student_scholarship the basis for Locke’s “rejection of speech
_regulation derives from his belief in inherent individual liberty - for Locke, speech was not_
_simply a means to arrive at the truth, but rather it was an absolute right guaranteed to_
_citizens by virtue of their status of autonomous, individual beings living in a free society”_
and “Locke's advocacy for modern constitutional government was not a coincidence, but
_rather stemmed from Locke's epistemological belief that the key to a stable society was not_
_stasis, but rather social and intellectual dynamism”._

Whichever moral philospher one goes by, free speech is the right of a free people. Sadly, free
speech in Australia is not truly supported by any major political party, only by some of the minor
parties who are not part of Government or Opposition.

**Free speech doesn’t always mean “nice” speech**
Making “bad” speech containing dis- or misinformation, or objectionable speech, illegal or
controlled doesn’t make it go away, it just drives it underground where it is far more dangerous

3


-----

because it becomes invisible and beyond refutation or public ridicule. The cure for bad speech is
good speech.

**Origin of moral viewpoints**
You can’t acquire incorrect or despicable views just by reading or watching something with
incorrect or unacceptable views. However, such views should not be censored either. It is helpful to
see these variant views so they can be refuted or mocked. If they are driven underground, no one
will ever see these views and like an infected wound they will just fester. Let these views be
“cleansed by the light”. Decent, correct and righteous views primarily come from proper parental
upbringing, proper teaching at school, religious experience and views promulgated from other
decent, learned and moral people. They do not originate with Government or their agents.

**It is censorship!**
Let’s call it what it is Censorship, the true name for the control of the supposed dis- or
misinformation being called for. It is incorrect to call it anything other than what it really is.
Honesty is essential in any discussion in any proposal to remove this fundamental element of
representative democracy, free speech.

**Is it Government’s role to decide what people can and can’t read?**
Fundamentally, the Government should not be in the business of deciding what a supposedly free
Australian people can and cannot read, or decide what is and isn’t “disinformation” or
“misinformation” whatever that is interpreted to mean and by whichever censor decides what
constitutes such material, presumably from a department equivalent to the “Ministry of Truth” in
Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty Four. I will discuss more on what constitutes “disinformation” and
“misinformation” elsewhere.

**A moderate start but what next?**
Like all government legislation, this is only a less malevolent beginning to something which will
gradually (or rapidly) expand in scope. This is generally called “mission creep”. With time the
regulation of speech will become much more draconian judging by how other anti-freedom
legislation develops. It always starts from the least objectionable position, although in this case the
starting position is already objectionable. It can only get far worse from here.

**PART 3 THE “OFFICIAL NARRATIVE”**

**The Official Narrative**
The Official Narrative is a term I have coined to describe Government’s official position on any
matter, which is also almost always reflected by the mainstream legacy media, social media (except
free speech oriented X/Twitter under present management) and corporations if they want to retain
good standing with government. Anything not in accord with the Official Narrative is deemed disand misinformation by Government and its agents (in legacy and social media).

What is really being enforced by the dis- and misinformation legislation is the Official Narrative.
Government will decide the Official Narrative on any topic and then will expect it to be ruthlessly
enforced under penalty of law or loss of Government favours to corporations.

_The Official Narrative is the real dis- and misinformation._

4


-----

There is rarely one “correct” opinion on anything. A free society has a plurality of opinions on
everything and these ought to be subject to an open, robust and vigorous public debate, something
not possible when Government seeks to enforce its own Official Narrative on any topic. Also, there
is no such thing as “settled science” as we will discuss.

Typically, anyone who questions the Official Narrative is falsely accused of being “a tin-foil hat
wearing conspiracy theorist”, “uneducated”, “fascist”, “various types of “phobic”” or any other of a
number of gratuitous ad hominem insults. These insults are undeserved and simply not true and
more a projection of the accuser.

**“Settled science” and “scientific consensus”**
In regard to supposed dis- or misinformation, one often hears the term that something is “settled
science” or “scientific consensus”. There is no such thing. I am a PhD scientist and no professional,
ethical scientist would ever say that (and I have never heard it said from an ethical learned
scientist). That’s not how science and the scientific method works. “One Hundred Authors Against
_Einstein” was published in 1931 denouncing Einstein’s work. When asked to comment on this_
denunciation of relativity by so many scientists, Einstein replied that to defeat relativity one did not
need the word of 100 scientists, just one fact. The “consensus” opinion is not necessarily correct
and has no scientific validity.

Scientific fact is not established by consensus, it never has been, real science never will be.

Also, for an example of “manufactured consensus” see article https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/08/09/fake-climate-changeconsensus “How That ‘Scientific Consensus’ on Climate Change Was ‘Manufactured’ by John Stossel, August 09, 2023.

**Doublethink**
Government dis- and misinformation may lead to some people having doublethink, a term derived
from George Orwell’s prophetic Nineteen Eighty Four, defined as follows: doublethink, /ˈdʌblθɪŋk/,
noun, the acceptance of contrary opinions or beliefs at the same time, especially as a result of
political indoctrination. An example of this would be when Government constantly tells the
Australian people that wind power is the cheapest of all methods of electricity generation and that
electricity bills are coming down; and then the people seeing their electricity bill for some of the
world’s most expensive electricity and accepting both positions as true.

GOVERNMENT ITSELF GENERATES MUCH DIS- AND MISINFORMATION IN ORDER TO
ENFORCE THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE AS WE SHALL SEE IN PART 5.

**PART 4 WHO DOES THE CENSORING?**

**Who will be doing the censoring?**
The intention is for private companies to do the censoring but this is only at the behest of
Government. It is utterly disingenuous to say this is not Government censorship when the private
companies know if they don’t comply they will be punished by Government. This is Government
censorship no matter how it is spun. In other words, the censorship by the private sector will only
happen as a requirement of the proposed legislation therefore it can only be truthfully considered
Government censorship.

5


-----

**“Fact checkers”**
If the Government isn’t directly censoring, private sector will be on their behalf. They already
employ “Fact checkers” (sic), often at the behest of Government, but will no doubt be forced to
employ more. So-called fact checkers are often no more than activist-journalists or “social justice
warriors” with no scientific, engineering, technical, medical or other training whatsoever (or even a
basic understanding thereof) involved in censoring or “correcting” some of the world’s leading
authorities in various areas of expertise and accusing them of being purveyors of so-called dis- or
misinformation. To paraphrase a famous activist “how dare they!”.

“Fact checkers” also overwhelmingly support the Government “Official Narrative”.

In the United States, the publication “The Federalist” was subject to false claims of
“disinformation” by “fact checkers” and discuss this in an article entitled “The Disinformation
_Police Are Even More Incompetent And Dishonest Than You Imagine”. Ref:_
https://thefederalist.com/2023/07/21/the-disinformation-police-are-more-incompetent-anddishonest-than-you-imagine/

**Why shouldn’t something be labeled or removed as dis- or misinformation?**
Labeling something dis- or misinformation (or removing/censoring it) stops legitimate questions
being asked which is the opposite of what is needed. For example the lab leak theory of the origin
of Covid-19 was labeled dis- or misinformation despite actual experts saying it was likely a humanmodified virus or at least was the result of a lab leak. Such a claim whether true or not, deserved
and continues to deserve thorough investigation but people were afraid to investigate it because the
Official Narrative said it was a natural zoonosis (of animal origin).

**Will legislation about dis- or misinformation make it disappear?**
Whatever the content that is sought to be removed, it will be just driven “underground”. Such
underground information will in fact be potentially quite harmful because it will not be able to be
seen, scrutinised, corrected by regular people or experts commenting on it or even known about.

**PART 5 EXAMPLES OF DIS- AND MISINFORMATION**

Some examples of things various Governments and/or their social media or legacy media agents
(and others) claimed were dis- or disinformation or false include the following:

_AS I WILL DEMONSTRATE IT IS GOVERNMENT ITSELF WHICH IS THE MAIN AND MOST_
_DANGEROUS SOURCE OF DIS- AND MISINFORMATION_

**DISINFORMATION #1 Australian Government censorship of social media posts re: Covid-19**
An example of the Australian Government itself propagating dis- and misinformation in the sense
that it censored alternative accurate information is the revelation that the Australian Government
used its social media agents to censor thousands of posts about Covid-19 which were in fact
factually correct.

**---CONTINUED---**

E.g. https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/many-censored-social-media-posts-did-notcontain-covid19-misinformation/news-story/c47a8217ffada2cf576475aef3c12c63

**_Banned Covid posts ‘totally factual’ “Many of 4000 social media posts secretly censored_**
_by government during the pandemic contained factual information and reasonable_
_arguments, rather than misinformation.”_

**DISINFORMATION #2 Ten things claimed by Covid-19 “experts” — now debunked**
Many or indeed most claims of the Official Narrative in regard to Covid-19 have now been
debunked. These are claims that Government and their agents claimed to be true while any
dissenting view on social media platforms was regarded as dis- and misinformation and censored.
Remarkably, this Australian (and other) Government sponsored dis- and misinformation are now
even being admitted to by the mainstream legacy media such as in the following article.

https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/10-myths-told-by-covid-experts-nowdebunked/news-story/d414984470291668356217f4b3fa1f9c

Summarising the above article the following items claimed by Government as truth are now known
to be false according to experts (authored by Marty Makary MD, MPH who is a Professor at the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the United States, one of the world’s leading
medical schools):

  - Government Misinformation #1: Natural immunity offers little protection compared to
vaccinated immunity

  - Government Misinformation #2: Masks prevent Covid transmission

  - Government Misinformation #3: School closures reduce Covid transmission

  - Government Misinformation #4: Myocarditis from the vaccine is less common than from the
infection

  - Government Misinformation #5: Young people benefit from a vaccine booster

  - Government Misinformation #6: Vaccine mandates increased vaccination rates

  - Government Misinformation #7: Covid originating from the Wuhan Lab is a conspiracy
theory

  - Government Misinformation #8: It was important to get the 2nd vaccine dose 3 or 4 weeks
after the 1st dose

  - Government Misinformation #9: Data on the bivalent vaccine is “crystal clear”

  - Government Misinformation #10: One in five people get long Covid

**Prof. Makary Tweeted on 28[th] February 2023:**
_Health officials were not wrong for making recommendations based on what was known at_
_the time. They were wrong because they refused to evolve their position in the face of new_
_evidence. When a study did not support their policies, they dismissed it (and censored_
_opposing opinions)._

It turns out that when Government both in Australia and elsewhere and their social media agents
censored dissenting views to the above, they were censoring the truth and it was thus an obvious
case of Government promoting the dis- or misinformation.

**DISINFORMATION #3 Wind and solar energy cheaper?**
In Australia wind and solar are constantly stated by Government to be “the cheapest form of
electricity production” but the truth is that the more we get, the more expensive consumer electricity
becomes. The Official Narrative is obviously not true but any attempt to question it results in
ridicule and even claims of dis- or misinformation. E.g. https://www.energy.gov.au/governmentpriorities/energy-supply “Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) are now the cheapest forms of new
_electricity generation in terms of electricity produced.” is obvious dis- or misinformation from the_
Australian Government.

**DISINFORMATION #4 Vitamin D and Covid-19 – Government dis- or misinformation**
Another example of Australian Government dis- or misinformation is about the association of
Vitamin D and Covid-19. At the following Government link it is stated that vitamin pills cannot
protect you from the coronovirus.

https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/blog/can-you-boost-your-immune-system-against-thecoronavirus-covid-19 _Do vitamin pills protect you from the coronavirus? No._

This is simply not true for the very large numbers of Australians, especially those in nursing homes
who are Vitamin D insufficient or deficient. It has been conclusively proven that appropriate
Vitamin D supplementation in such people does have a protective effect against coronavirus.

See Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2023 Jan; 16(1): 130 “Protective Effect of Vitamin D
Supplementation on COVID-19-Related Intensive Care Hospitalization and Mortality:
Definitive Evidence from Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis” “In conclusion, the
_positive results highlighted again and now validated by TSAs [Trial Sequential Analysis]_
_suggest that an indisputable association between vitamin D supplementation and the_
_protective effect on ICU [Intensive Care Unit] admission can be considered definitive_
_evidence.”_

_How many Australians died unnecessarily because the Australian Government said that Vitamin D_
_could not protect against coronavirus disease? A measure as simple as mailing a bottle of Vitamin_
D with instructions to every household in Australia could have saved countless lives (apart from
other measures).

**DISINFORMATION #5 “There are no vaccine mandates in Australia”**
That is yet another case of Australian Government misinformation. The former PM Scott Morrison
repeatedly said that “there were no vaccine mandates in Australia” but that clearly was untrue as
numerous Australians were sacked from the jobs, including doctors, nurses, airline pilots and many
others for refusing to participate in vaccine mandates. And mandates remain to this day in various
sectors and in Melbourne there is a lady who is is being refused a heart transplant to this very day
because she refuses to be vaccinated (following a a permanent legal exemption from the Australian
Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)) and has to go overseas at her own expense
(via fundraising) to get a transplant in a country with no such mandates.

Ref: https://twitter.com/senatorbabet/status/1648641222121234432 “Despite being a strong
_candidate for a transplant the Alfred Hospital has refused to place her on the transplant list._
_Why?” and https://twitter.com/MRobertsQLD/status/1590628165235650579 “Scott_
_Morrison's claim that 'there are no vaccine mandates' in Australia was always fake news”._

-----

**DISINFORMATION #6 Myocarditis is only a “rare” side-effect of Covid-19 vaccination?**
The Australian Government claims injuries from Covid-19 vaccinations are rare but this appears not
to be true. For example, in respect to just one documented side-effect, myocarditis, the following
journal article documents that such injuries are more common than claimed.

Eur J Heart Fail 2023 Jul 20. doi: 10.1002/ejhf.2978.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37470105/
“Sex-specific differences in myocardial injury incidence after COVID-19 mRNA-1273
Booster Vaccination”
“...In conclusion, using active surveillance, mRNA-1273 vaccine-associated mild transient
_myocardial injury was found to be much more common than previously thought. It occurred_
_in one out of 35 persons, was mild and transient, and more frequent in women versus_
_men….”_

Unlike many other tissues, once heart tissue is damaged, even if the damage is sub-clinical, in all
but the mildest cases, the damage can be permanent and long term effects unknown. It was
misinformation for the Australian Government and their agents to say such effects are rare or
necessarily harmless. An injury rate of 1 in 35 is not “rare” in a compulsory mass-vaccination
campaign.

**DISINFORMATION #7 W.A. Government Covid-19 vaccine adverse reactions report**
There was an unexpectedly extremely candid and honest report from the WA Government, “Western
Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance – Annual Report 2021” released late and only recently:
https://www.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Corp/Documents/Health-for/Immunisation/WesternAustralia-Vaccine-Safety-Surveillance-Annual-Report-2021.pdf

The extremely high rate of reported adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccinations was documented.
Reference to page 28 shows an adverse rate of events of 11.1 per 100,000 doses for non-Covid-19
vaccinations and 264.1 per 100,000 doses for Covid-19 vaccinations. Note that not all adverse
reactions will have been reported as many doctors were afraid of ridicule if they reported the truth
(because the Official Narrative said the vaccines were safe and side-effects were extremely rare).

_It is Australian Government misinformation to say that the Covid-19 vaccine was safe if it has an_
_adverse event rate of nearly 24 times that of conventional vaccines according to information from_
_an Australian State Government._

**DISINFORMATION #8 Claim: Hunter Biden laptop Dis/Misinformation**
The Hunter Biden laptop is a US story but relevant to Australia because the US is our closest and
most powerful ally and misinformation on that affected the 2020 US Presidential outcome.

This story also shows how false claims of dis- and misinformation can swing democratic elections.
This could equally apply to Australia.

According to https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2020/nov/26/cooper-biden-voters/ “one of
_every six Biden voters (17%) said they would not have voted for him had they known the facts about_
_several of the news stories the national media refused to investigate thoroughly” and “Had one of_
_six voters not voted for Biden in the swing states, or voted for Trump instead, the election would_
_have turned out differently.”._

The Offcial Narrative was that the Hunter Biden laptop was “disinformation”. E.g This article from
2020 claims that the story about the contents of the laptop were “Russian disinfo”
https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276 and then this

9


-----

article points out the contents are in fact authentic
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/30/hunter-biden-laptop-data-examined/ .
Nobody today including Hunter Biden himself denies that the contents are authentic.

**DISINFORMATION #9 Claim: Covid-19 lockups were effective**
In Australia and many places worldwide citizens were effectively held at home under house-arrest
allowed to leave only for “essential” activities. The Official Narrative was that lockups (lockdowns)
saved lives e.g. for Victoria see https://www.health.vic.gov.au/covid-19/victorias-pandemicmanagement-framework and https://www.health.vic.gov.au/covid-19/pandemic-order-register
And yet, the lockups came at tremendous human, physical health, mental health and economic cost.
While the Offcial Narrative was that lockups reduced transmission of Covid-19 but this is highly
questionable as studies show. For example:

In https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9368251/ “Are Lockdowns Effective in
Managing Pandemics?”, Moshe Yanovskiy and Yehoshua Socol, Int J Environ Res Public
Health. 2022 Aug; 19(15): 9295 comment that “extreme measures that deprived billions of
_their basic human rights”, “The extent of human life lost due to lockdowns themselves has_
_never been quantitatively reported”, “governments continuously stuck to these measures_
_despite the absence of proof that such measures were effective in controlling the pandemic”,_
and draw the conclusions that “1) Neither previous pandemics nor COVID-19 provide clear
_evidence that lockdowns help to prevent death in pandemic and 2) Lockdowns are_
_associated with a considerable human cost. Even if somewhat effective in preventing_
_COVID-19 death, they probably cause far more extensive (an order of magnitude or more)_
_loss of life.”_

Also see https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/what-if-lockdowns-dont-save-lives/newsstory/5a7b69881d3323d5edd51698270e2422 “What if lockdowns don’t save lives? - The evidence
_supporting lockdowns is shockingly weak, resting on little more than anecdote, faith and_
_tendentious modelling.”_

And https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/lockdowns-hurt-mental-health-more-than-case-numbersdeaths-20220921-p5bjt5 “Lockdowns hurt mental health more than case numbers, deaths”.

_The Official Narrative said Covid-19 lockups were good. The truth was that they weren’t._

**DISINFORMATION #10 CO2 emissions by country**
To listen to all state and federal governments constantly talking about Australia’s CO2 emissions
one would actually believe the dis- and misinformation that Australia has an especially serious CO2
emissions problem.

But nothing could be further from the truth. Australia actually has a very low, ranked 14 (Table 1),
level of CO2 emissions while China has a level of emissions more than twice that of the United
States. CO2 emissions are leveling off or decreasing in Western countries (see Figure 1) while
China has no emissions limits imposed on it whatsoever and they are building about two new coal

fired power stations every week (see Ref below) and emissions are increasing dramatically. It’s
hardly worth destroying our economy for as we are in fact doing.

**DISINFORMATION #11 Excess deaths**
Using official Government Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, Senator Rennick and many
others have analysed Australia’s “excess death” statistics pre, during and post Covid-19 with some
alarming factual results. See, for example, https://gerardrennick.com.au/mainstream-media-excessdeaths-not-covid/ . And yet this factual information based upon the Government’s own statistics is
claimed to be dis- or misinformation. Other analyses were based on figures by the Actuaries
Institute (Australia) https://www.actuaries.digital/2023/03/06/almost-20000-excess-deaths-for2022-in-australia/ They conclude in part:

_Our expectation is that excess mortality for the full year 2022 will be 12% i.e. there were_
_nearly 20,000 more deaths in 2022 than would have been expected if the pandemic had not_
_happened._

_Just over half of the expected excess mortality for 2022 is due to deaths from COVID-19_
_(+10,300 deaths), with another +2,900 where COVID-19 was a contributing factor, and the_
_remaining excess of +6,600 with no mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate._

Surely this excess which has been seen in Australia and many other countries is worth looking into
more deeply and not simply dismissed as dis- or misinformation? How many more people need to
die because this information wasn’t and isn’t analysed more deeply or publicly debated?

**DISINFORMATION #12 Bushfires caused by “climate change”**
Recent wildfires in Greece were claimed to be due to “climate change” in accord with the Official
Narrative even though the Greek Government stated they were due to arson. Many Australian
bushfires are also falsely attributed to “climate change” when they were in fact arson.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/28/greece-fires-arsonists-extreme-weather
“Most fires in Greece were started ‘by human hand’, government says”

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51125898 _A 2008 study found that in Australia about_
_85% of fires were triggered by human activity - this includes arson, but also carelessness or_
_recklessness._

_According to Australia's National Centre for Research in Bushfire and Arson, 13% of_
_bushfires every year are deliberate and 37% are suspicious._

_In the US state of California, 95% of wildfires are started by people - 7% of those by arson -_
_according to Cal Fire, the state's fire service._

**DISINFORMATION #13 The historical global temperature record**
Many claims of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming are based on a supposed instrumental
record going back to the 1800’s but few people are aware that instrumental data for the world is
extremely sparse until well after the 1950’s. The figure below demonstrates the very few stations in
the US Government NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network. As Tony Heller has pointed
out (e.g. https://youtu.be/1wpspx8EunU and https://youtu.be/r0l3tymEagc ) data is being generated
(invented) for places for times where none was ever recorded and it is also being altered as Heller
clearly demonstrates with NASA’s own documents in the second video.

**DISINFORMATION #14 Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming**
The Australia Government is possibly among the most fanatical followers of the unproven
hypothesis of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming of all the Governments of the world, but
it is based on fraudulent evidence (as demonstrated by Tony Heller in videos linked at
DISINFORMATION #13 above) and non-validated computer models. The graph below from
testimony by John R. Christy from University of Alabama in Huntsville before the U.S. House
Committee on Science, Space & Technology on 2nd Feb 2016 demonstrates the invalidity of the
climate models on which the Australian Government is betting the entire economy.

In coventional scientific fields, such a lack of agreement with actual data would render the models
invalid.

**DISINFORMATION #15 The Hockey Stick Graph**
The infamous Hockey Stick Graph which purported to show catastrophic global warming was first
published in 1998 and in 2001 was used in the UN’s IPCC came out with its Third Assessment
Report.

This misinformation of that graph has been thoroughly discredited and there is an extensive history
to that, too much to go into here. The reader is referred to
https://www.justfacts.com/globalwarming.hidethedecline.asp and
https://www.manhattancontrarian.com/blog/2019-8-26-michael-mann-hockey-stick-update-nowdefinitively-proven-to-be-fraud for the full history.

And yet despite the highly questionable nature of the graph, including the removal of the Medieval
Warm Period, it was extensively used to drive Australian Government and other Government
climate policy. According to the website at
https://enthusiasmscepticismscience.wordpress.com/global-temperature-graphs/hockeystickaustgov/
the Australian Government published the totally discredited Hockey Stick Graph and it was not
removed from the Australian Government Climate Change website until late 2009. In other words
the Australian Government was using invalid data to direct its own climate policy.

Also, for an Australian perspective on the hockey Stick, see https://www.spectator.com.au/2020/12/

**DISINFORMATION #16 Hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment**
The Australian Government falsely claimed Hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment was toxic
when taken according to published protocols but it is one of the safest drugs in the world when
taken in any conceivable, reasonable or appropriate dose.

See https://www.tga.gov.au/news/safety-alerts/new-restrictions-prescribinghydroxychloroquine-covid-19 “However, these medicines pose well-known serious risks to
_patients including cardiac toxicity (potentially leading to sudden heart attacks), irreversible_
_eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar (potentially leading to coma).” (Published_
24 March 2020.)

Hydroxychloroquine taken according to published protocols (e.g. Zelenko) was shown to be
effective for the treatment of Covid-19 but was banned by the Australian Government even before
vaccines were available.

Early studies of effectiveness include https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S12019712(20)30534-8/fulltext “Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and
combination in patients hospitalized with COVID-19” Published July 01, 2020
DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.099 “Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66% hazard
_ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin 71% compared to neither treatment_
_(p < 0.001).”_

More effective protocols were later developed that included zinc such as the acclaimed Zelenko
protocol:

**DISINFORMATION #17 Ivermectin for Covid-19 treatment**
Strangely, there was similar Government dis- and misinformation about Ivermcetin as for
Hydroxychloroquine. https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/new-restrictions-prescribingivermectin-covid-19 “These higher doses can be associated with serious adverse effects, including
_severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, neurological effects such as dizziness, seizures and coma.”_
Certainly no such toxicity has been reported when Ivermectin taken for Covid-19 treatment for an
appropriate time, in an appropriate dose and according to the correct protocol.

Early studies include:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8088823/ “Review of the Emerging
Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of
COVID-19” Am J Ther. 2021 May-Jun; 28(3): e299–e318
https://doi.org/10.1097%2FMJT.0000000000001377 “Meta-analyses based on 18
_randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large,_
_statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral_
_clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report_
_significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin.”_

Dr Pierre Kory wrote a book about Ivermectin and its efficacy for Covid-19 treatment, according to
appropriate protocols, “The War on Ivermectin: The Medicine that Saved Millions and Could Have
_Ended the Pandemic”._

A widely cited study from 2022 claiming that Ivermectin was ineffective did not use zinc
supplementation as is a fundamental requirement for Kory’s protocol.

Another 2022 study was:

“Regular Use of Ivermectin as Prophylaxis for COVID-19 Led Up to a 92% Reduction in

_compared to the regular use of ivermectin. This dose-response efficacy reinforces the_
_prophylactic effects of ivermectin against COVID-19.”_

**DISINFORMATION #18 Covid-19 vaccines would stop transmission and hospitalisation**
Clearly this was not true at all and never was. E.g. see https://joannenova.com.au/2021/10/uk-studyfinds-covid-spreads-just-as-easily-from-the-vaccinated/

**PART 6 CALLING OUT DIS- AND MISINFORMATION**

**Honest sources of information**
_As I have shown above, clearly Government is not a reliable, accurate or honest source of_
_information. Government provides the Official Narrative, which rarely corresponds to the truth, at_
_least in the examples I have provided._

So where are people to obtain their information? It requires critical thinking, something that was
once taught in schools but can be developed by anyone, even today and people will find reliable
web sites they can trust. One Australian blog site that comes to mind is Jo Nova’s at
https://joannenova.com.au/ . A YouTuber who gives honest, evidence-based information about
Covid-19 and other medical issues is Dr John Campbell. Tony Heller is another YouTuber who
provides evidence-based information on “Climate Change”. There are many others, both Australian
and International.

Among sites that should not generally be trusted are social media sites which act as agents for
Government (except X, formerly Twitter which doesn’t do Government censorship) and legacy
media sites when they act as agents for Government and thus are complicit in propagating dis- and
misinformation from Government of the type I have highlighted above. And especially, Government
sites should not be trusted unless there is proof that they are providing accurate information.

**Science education**
There is remarkable scientific ignorance in the community and especially among journalists and
politicians. It is a sad indictment on the education system and science education in particular, as
well as the failure to teach critical thinking skills. People would be far less susceptible to dis- and
misinformation if they were appropriately educated.

**The limits of free speech**
There are of course some limits to free speech, this boundary it traditionally considered to be at
actively calling for imminent acts of violence or other violations of the law such as portrayals of
actual criminal acts. These acts are of course already illegal and no new laws are required to deal
with them. And to quote the classic objection by those opposed to free speech, it does not mean
people can call “fire in a theatre”. There is much legal jurisprudence on that very issue which we
will not go into here.

16


-----

**The effect of Australian Government Dis- and Misinformation**
Examples presented previously show that some of the most pervasive and dangerous dis- and
misinformation comes from Government. That is the information people tend to believe. Not
information from “fringe dwellers”. Government dis- and misinformation is what needs to be
controlled and exposed.

Australian Government dis- and misinformation, especially in areas such as Covid-19 (leading to
tremendous economic, social and physical harm) and “climate change” (leading to some of the
world’s most expensive economy-destroying electricity prices in Australia) have resulted in a huge
distrust of Government, medical and other authorities. This is not very conducive to a trusting or
coherent society. Nowadays, Government and politicians tend to be seen more as the Enemy and
not the humble servants of the people. Distrust and disrespect of Government is extremely high.

Also, Government dis- and misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines (documented above) has led to
many people developing a mistrust of conventional vaccines and medications which are necessary
for the good health of the Australian community. This will likely result in a drop of vaccination
rates and reduced uptake of required medications.

**How does dis- and misinformation propagate?**
Much genuine dis- and misinformation is allowed to propagate because because a vast majority of
so-called journalists no longer practice genuine journalism as in the practice of impartial reporting
or investigative reporting but they just reproduce press releases from Government Ministers .
Government departments and special interest groups or individuals without any critical assessment
whatsoever, at least the ones that they agree with and who follow the Official Narrative.

Anything critical of the Official narrative is either ignored by the journalist or the writer of the
criticism is subject to vicious ad hominem attacks.

Our democracy is seriously threatened by the failure of a vast amount of contemporary journalists
to practice their jobs in accord with the traditional standards of that professsion.

**A serious threat to democracy**
Claims of dis- and misinformation are a threat to the democratic process when they are used to
silence elected members of state and federal Australian Parliaments. For example, social media
platforms have threatened to “de-platform” (cancel the accounts) of Representatives and Senators
for supposed dis- and misinformation. When this process is controlled by Government, it is easy to
see how dissenting and Opposition voices can be cancelled.

Also, as reported by Sky News Australia August 02, 2021, they had their YouTube account
suspended for a period of time for suppose dis- or misinformation even though those comments
were based on those from experts (or indeed good management of public health). See
https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/chris-kenny/sky-news-australia-youtube-suspension-iscancel-culture-writ-large/video/bcf1b9d4a63ade44c6608f48f676ecaa . Alarmingly, several
journalists from the taxpayer funded Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) publically
supported the banning of Sky News.

**---CONTINUED---**

In the United States, the Biden White House asked Facebook to limit distribution of the Facebook
feed of The Daily Wire publication (among many other examples of illegal Government-sponsored
censorship in the US) . Ref:
https://www.themainewire.com/2023/08/facebook-files-biden-admin-pressured-company-to-censorny-post-daily-wire-vaccine-negative-posts/

None of this is conducive to democracy or truth.

_How many elected representatives or media outlets remain silent under threat of “cancellation”?_

**So who are the real journalists today? The citizen-journalists.**
Many politicians say things that are misleading or even untrue. Once the news media called out
politicians for such things but unfortunately most media now uncritically reproduce Government
press releases as their “reporting” on various subjects. Thankfully, the role of calling out politicians
has been replaced by citizen-journalists in social and other online media who do the job that
traditional mainstream media can no longer be bothered doing. They are the ones that call out disand misinformation from Government and other sources.

**Consequences of questioning the Official Narrative (Government dis- and misinformation)**
Questioning the Official Narrative typically results in false claims againts the questioner of dis- and
misinformation and are met with a variety of ad hominen insults as mentioned earlier.

Beyond insults, State-sponsored violence can also ensue. For example, violence by Victoria Police
was shown in numerous viral videos with police engaging with Covid-19 anti-lockup protesters,
including police using military armoured personnel carriers, something we once only expected to
see in Third World dictatorships.

Note also, Australia and Victoria in particular had the harshest and most totalitarian Covid-19
lockups in the world. In fact scenes of the police action against alleged violations of Covid-19
lockup laws in Australia are “viral” worldwide and regularly used as examples of Covid-19
dystopia.

These acts brought great shame upon Australia and damage to its international reputation.

**And what next?**
When Government embarks on a course of action such as censorship there is really no limit as to
how far they are prepared to go. There will be ever more relentless demands from lobby groups and
opposing politicians to have any supposed dis/misinformation unfavourable to their cause
suppressed. It will go further than that. Soon Government will be demanding mandatory blocking of
various free speech oriented web sites or indeed any web site that doesn’t follow the Official
Narrative on any matter. It will end up precisely the nightmare scenario of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty
_Four._

_Nineteen Eighty Four was meant to be a warning, not an instruction manual._

**Viewpoint of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.**
The comments from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the very things under discussion seem remarkably
prescient for what the Australian Government has already done and intends to do:

“Totalitarians Will Always Have a Good Excuse for Infringing Upon Your Freedoms”

18


-----

“During COVID … the government established a new precedent, which is that if it has a
_good enough excuse, the government can now take away all of our freedoms.”_

“And guess what?” … “There is always a good excuse, whether it’s to stop a new disease,
_the next pandemic, to protect us from misinformation, to prevent domestic terrorism, to stop_
_hate speech, to prosecute a war, or to fight climate change.”_

“But all of these reasons can easily turn into pretext,” …. “Control over the public starts
_perhaps as a means, but it always becomes an end.”_

(Ref: https://twitter.com/VigilantFox/status/1659735403887206401 )

**Banning political figures**
Banning political figures from Australia is another form of censorship. For example, Nigel Farage
and Donald Trump Jr were recently effectively banned from Australia when their visas were denied
until the very last moment, making it impossible to conduct their tour. One of the purposes of their
tour was to correct dis- and misinformation told about them and their causes and the Australian
Government stopped them doing that.

**PART 7 AUSTRALIA DOES HAVE SOME HOPE LEFT**

**There is hope**
And how do we control Government dis- and misinformation? In Federal Parliament, of the 76
Senators; Senators Babet, Roberts, P. Hanson, Rennick, Antic, Canavan are the few who are all
well-informed, honest, independent thinkers who have tried to fight against Australian Government
dis- and misinformation despite powerful efforts to silence them. They have all fearlessly asked
questions of Government Ministers and corporations both inside and outside of Parliament. These
Senators should be commended for their commitment to perform their sworn duties and their
commitment to the Australian people.

**Additional points**

  - The free flow of information in all its forms is essential for democracy.

  - The cure for bad information is good information, for bad speech good speech.

  - The risk of misinformation from government is far more dangerous than that from
individuals on social medial because of Government power to control the media, the view
that many people incorrectly have that Government information is true and authoritative and
the lack of commitment to freedom of speech of most politicians in the major parties and the
bureaucracy.

  - Ultimately the government, politicians and the bureaucracy need to realise that they work
for the people, not themselves or indeed the United Nations or the World Economic Forum.

**In conclusion**
Let the Australian people use their intelligence to decide what is true and what isn’t, especially as
the body deciding, the Australian Government and its agencies and servants can hardly be trusted to
tell the truth as I have shown many examples of Australian Government dis- and misinformation. As

Thomas Jefferson said: “Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people
_alone. The people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories.” Australians lost enough_
precious freedoms during the Covid-19 lockups, some of the, if not the most draconian in the world,
and no Australian Government federal or state has any intentions of returning them. Please don’t
take away any more.

**Submission concerning “New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation”.**

**SUPPLEMENTAL SUBMISSION, Date: 18[th] August 2023**

**Author: Dr David S. Maddison**

              - FOR PUBLICATION *

“IN TIMES OF UNIVERSAL DECEIT TELLING THE TRUTH IS A REVOLUTIONARY ACT”

Please not this is a supplemental addition to my main submission.

Quoting from: https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/communicationslegislation-amendment-combatting-misinformation-and-disinformation-bill-2023-guidance-notejune2023_2.pdf an example of how supposed misinformation can harm Australians is presented:

This seems to be based on a claim falsely attributed to President Trump.

This is extraordinary misinformation by the Australian Government about the former US
President.

It is false because, as I shall show below: 1) President Trump never said it and 2) there was no
known case of anybody actually doing it.

_The Government has fabricated something that was never said and never happened in support of_
_this dystopian censorship legislation._

On April 23, 2020 President Trump was in a press conference with William Bryan, the then
Undersecretary for Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland Security, who
presented a study that stated that coronavirus viral particles that linger on surfaces can be killed by
sun exposure and cleaning agents like bleach.

There is nothing whatsoever odd about these comments by Mr Bryan, it is basic biology and
ultraviolet light such as is an element of sunlight and cleaning agents such as bleach are used all the
time as sterilising agents in hospitals and laboratories.

There was thus a role for such cleaning and sterilising agents in the control of coronavirus. In fact,
countless millions or billions of dollars were spent in Australia and elsewhere constantly cleaning
and sterilising any surfaces that people may have touched during the pandemic, including street
furniture which would naturally be sterilised by sunlight in any case.

Trump, in unprepared off-the-cuff comments, just waxed lyrical about whether such disinfection
strategies would have a role in treating people.

He said as follows:

1


-----

"A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you’re totally into that world, which I find
to be very interesting. So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it’s ultraviolet or
just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it.
And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the
skin or in some other way. (To Bryan) And I think you said you’re going to test that, too. Sounds
interesting, right?"

"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do
something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and
it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to
have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole
**concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful."**

After a reporter asked a question he clarified:

"It wouldn’t be through injections, almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works,
maybe it doesn’t work, but it certainly has a big effect if it’s on a stationary object."

**At no point did he tell people to inject or ingest bleach.**

It so turns out that ultraviolet light therapy was something that was scientifically investigated after
Trump mentioned it. For example see the reference at:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34173969/
Adv Ther 2021 Aug;38(8):4556-4568. doi: 10.1007/s12325-021-01830-7. Epub 2021 Jun 26.
“Endotracheal Application of Ultraviolet A Light in Critically Ill Patients with Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A First-in-Human Study”

**_Introduction: Our previous preclinical experiments show that under specific and monitored_**
_conditions, ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure reduces certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses including_
_coronavirus-229E without harming mammalian columnar epithelial cells…..Conclusions: In this_
_first-in-human study, endotracheal narrow-band UVA therapy, under specific and monitored settings,_
_appears to be safe and associated with a reduction in respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral burden over the_
_treatment period. UVA therapy may provide a novel approach in the fight against COVID-19._

**There was no known case of anyone ingesting or injecting bleach**
See, for example:

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287837
Did people really drink bleach to prevent COVID-19? A guide for protecting survey data against
problematic respondents

_Overall, we did not find a single respondent who provided any reasonable or compelling open-ended_
_descriptions of ingestion of cleaning products._

**This is another example how the Australian Government is a purveyor of misinformation**
This is exactly the type of Australian Government misinformation I spoke about in my main
submission and why this misinformation legislation must NOT go through because anything
contrary to this false but Official Government Narrative would be censored. There would be no one
to correct this Government misinformation.
