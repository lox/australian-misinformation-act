Nobel prize winning economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek noted in his seminal
essay, 'The Use of Knowledge in Society' (one of the most referenced articles of the
20th century) that no one individual or entity is capable of acquiring all of the
knowledge or expertise required to sensibly and efficiently allocate resources across
a broad society. No citizen, no CEO, no government minister, no professor, no union,
no medical board, no social media network, nor any other actor or body is capable of
performing this task, because all humans lack perfect knowledge. Indeed,
realistically no one has more than the smallest sliver of knowledge, and it is only
through the exchange of speech, ideas, and information that any market, society, or
even democracy can function.

The exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 suggests that ‘misinformation and
disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as our
democracy, society and economy’. The proposed solution essentially amounts to
empowering the ACMA to compel social media platforms to monitor and manipulate
online speech. Is this an appropriate solution?

An immediate and fundamental question arises. Who will be determining what
speech is misinformation/disinformation? Referencing Hayek, no individual or body is
capable of attaining perfect knowledge. No one has the perfect knowledge required
to determine what speech is misinformation/disinformation.

Is the government capable of determining what is misinformation/disinformation? Is
the government capable of doing so in an apolitical fashion, unaffected by lobbyists
or stronger incentives such as their perceived popularity/electability? The entire body
of the public choice school of economics suggests otherwise. Politicians and
bureaucrats are human beings, driven by self-interest like all others and thus as
prone to bias as anyone else.

Are scientists, professors, academics and experts capable of determining what is
misinformation/disinformation? Perhaps in certain instances, but ‘science’ is not
monolithic, and consensus/majority opinion does not determine truth. One must only
remember that for decades, the practice of lobotomy was considered an appropriate,
‘scientifically-based’ medical procedure, garnering swift acceptance throughout the
western world in the 1940s. Dr Antonio Moniz, the originator of the procedure which
involved severing brain connections in order to treat neurological disorders like
depression, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1949. Today,
lobotomization is regarded as barbaric and with little scientific merit. Yet at the time,
the expert community of the medical field may have dismissed any criticism of
lobotomization as ‘misinformation/disinformation’.

Let us not pretend other scientific fields are fundamentally different in that all fields
are incapable of perfect knowledge and thus incapable to determining without a
doubt what information is misinformation/disinformation. All scientists and experts
should be free to speak and publicly debate/discuss the truth of information, not
attempting to impose an ideological orthodoxy upon society. Equally, the ‘majority
consensus’ does not ensure perfect knowledge or truth, as the previous standard of
lobotomy exemplifies.

Since neither government actors nor experts are capable of truly knowing what
information is misinformation/disinformation (and the ACMA is comprised of
government actors and experts), the ACMA would prove incapable of determining
what information is misinformation/disinformation. This is no slight towards the
ACMA; no one has access to perfect knowledge, and no one is truly capable of
making this distinction without censoring speech that may indeed be true. If
legislation existed in the 1940s, would the ACMA then have pressured newspapers
to ‘combat misinformation and disinformation’ from decriers of lobotomy? Would the
ACMA have ‘enforced an industry standard’ (i.e., fines, lawsuits) on newspapers who
chose not to comply with ‘expert, majority medical industry opinion’ about the safety
and efficacy of lobotomization?

What is the solution to misinformation/disinformation? The same as the solution to
Hayek’s knowledge problem: more speech and freer speech. Bring speech into the
forefront, out into the open, to be debated, spotlighted, tested, exposed, to succeed
or fail based on merit and broad social examination. Let us not pretend that
malicious and/or false information will cease to exist if regulated. It will simply move
underground to less public channels, where public and expert eyes will be unable to
challenge, debate or expose its meritless nature.

This legislation should be rejected and an alternate approach based on encouraging
less regulation and potential censorship proposed. Poisonous mould grows best in
darkness but dies in sunlight. The best disinfectant for false information is more
exposure, not less.
