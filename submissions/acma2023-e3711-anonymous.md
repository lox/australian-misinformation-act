Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am strongly opposed to this bill. Freedom of speech is a fundamental value in our democratic society and this Bill
seeks to restrict that in significant ways.

It is of deep concern to me and many others that the government and mainstream media are exempt from the
operation of this Bill. Perhaps the bill should have been called “the Censorship Bill”!!

We discover the truth when there is an opportunity for the robust exchange of ideas. ACMA should not be the arbiter
of truth.

Please reject this proposed law.
