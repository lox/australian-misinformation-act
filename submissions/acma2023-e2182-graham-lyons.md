# Comments on the proposed ALP anti-freedom of speech bill

 Graham Lyons B Agric Sci, M Public Health, PhD

 “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a subversive act”.

 As Senator Alex Antic notes: “People are increasingly turning away from mainstream media for their news and information, and it seems the Labor government is displeased.” And Senator Ralph Babet states: “The government wants to cancel all dissenting voices by establishing a 1984-style “Ministry of Truth.” “

 This bill is a grotesque abuse of every democratic norm and represents a dangerous lurch down the path to totalitarianism which all Australians should oppose. It gives the government power to regulate “truth” online by being able to force social media platforms to censor “misinformation” and “disinformation” that is “harmful”—three vague terms that are open to very broad interpretation, a ploy typical of totalitarian regimes.

 ACMA makes rules so that digital platforms do not operate technically in conflict with each other. It has no role in deciding what is misinformation or disinformation on digital platforms. As Wilson Sy points out: “A digital platform is merely a modern version of the public forum in the town square. It would be laughable to the ancients, to think the town square was responsible for what people said there.”

 During the coronahoax, social media companies entered into informal arrangements with government agencies to aggressively police content on their platforms; with this bill, the Albanese government seeks to make those arrangements formal and permanent.

 ”Health misinformation” would no doubt include the fact that the covid “vaccines” have killed and maimed countless people globally…and counting. And how about pointing out that the ridiculously harmful and expensive “net zero carbon” agenda is based on lies. Carbon dioxide is our friend, and the Earth is not warming. And saying that men shouldn’t play women's sports, or defending traditional marriage, will of course be deemed “hate speech”. No- one, including ACMA, has the right or the knowledge to decide what is information, misinformation or disinformation.

# The mainstream media (or rather fake news, Judas goat media, as shown  during the coronahoax), federal, state and local governments, as well as woke educational institutions, are excluded from censorship under the bill. How Orwellian can it get? 

 This government’s behaviour is reminiscent of Hitler’s ascendancy to power in the 1930s. We can take heart and be encouraged by the very fact that this government feels the need for such draconian legislation. Its dystopian agenda has clearly been disrupted by the widespread dissemination of truth to date.

 “My passionate belief is that the second most precious thing in life is the right to express yourself freely. The most precious is food in your mouth and the third most precious is a roof over your head.” Rowan Atkinson

 In the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution: “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press”.

 And free speech is enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia helped to draft in 1948: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”
