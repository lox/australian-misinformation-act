Social media is rife with misinformation and disinformation; but the only way to combat it is to
publicly refute it, not censorship.

Limiting speech is far more dangerous to society than the regrettable consequences of false claims.

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media and regardless of frontiers.

Social media is a double-edged sword: it can be a channel for the worst misinformation and
disinformation, but so can governments, as we have witnessed; alternatively, it can also be
the medium that exposes government and corporate lies that the corporate mainstream
media won’t, which restores power to the people.

Regulating truth on social media will not protect democracy, it will suppress it.

We are animals of ideas and expression, if we suppress these, then we will become almost
non-human. We must be free to hear other people’s thoughts and ideas no matter how
extreme they maybe, otherwise these things will be hidden and become under ground which
is even more dangerous, better to have things out in the open no matter how offended some
people may be.

Thank you.
