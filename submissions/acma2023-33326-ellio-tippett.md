# Hi, I am writing to give my utmost concern at the new disinformation bill. This bill is a total breach the public trust and gives unmitigated power to those who weld it, in the form of state controlled censorship. We are not in communist Russia! This bill is a massive threat to the democratic process and should be treated with the upmost contempt and caution. You the government are supposed to be there to serve the will of the people, not to impose draconian laws of control and coercion. You need to start behaving with this concept in mind. So as a citizen of this country I am 100% against this bill.
