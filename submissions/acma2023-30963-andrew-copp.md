**Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill**

Dear Government

Please withdraw the above draft Bill.

I wish to continue in a society where issues can be debated without fear of potentially being
removed from social media sites where my views are considered false, misleading or deceptive.

I hold perspectives on same sex marriage, vaccine mandates, immigration, drug policy, public
advertising standards etc etc that I feel may be considered under the bill to qualify for de-platforming.

People have different perspectives of the world, values and ideas. Please let us continue to have a
vibrant exchange where contest often helps the best to surface.

Kind Regards

Andrew
