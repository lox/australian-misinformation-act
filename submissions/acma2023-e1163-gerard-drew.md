I strongly reject this proposed legislation. The draft exposure says it is about keeping Australians safe from “harm”. But the
government will cause harm by silencing Australians! The Commonwealth is responsible for protecting the rights of the individual,
not suppressing them.

This is government over each on a grand scale.
What makes the government think it has the right to be the arbiter of what is "misinformation and disinformation. What
arrogance!!

This bill is an attack on freedom and democracy.
