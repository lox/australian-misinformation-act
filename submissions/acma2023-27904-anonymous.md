  - This bill will violate Australian’s democratic and constitutional rights to freedom of
speech.

  - It blames the informer for the behaviour of the recipient by claiming that
‘misinformation’/’disinformation’ can cause people to do inappropriate things.

  - It can be used to censor any information on any issue that any government does
not approve now and in the future.

  - It puts the development of a code of practice in the hands of the industry, leaving
the general public out of the loop.

  - No one government or agency has a monopoly on truth. Our perception of truth
evolves over time with experience.

  - It will silence dissenting experts.

Some of the questions that need to be asked about the Bill include these.

1. Who decides what constitutes ‘misinformation’/’ disinformation? (Their

qualifications, experience, ties with industry)

2. To whom and what products will it apply? (unhealthy foods/cosmetics?)

3. What process will be used for the government to determine what constitutes

‘misinformation’/’disinformation’?

4. How will it monitor the developments in that area to update its understanding of

information/disinformation in the future?

5. How will the government communicate to all Australians (of all ages, ethnicities,

education levels and abilities) what they can and can’t say in the future?
