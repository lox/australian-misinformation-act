I'm writing to voice my objection to the "New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation".

For sake of brevity, I'll exlude discussion regarding an individuals subjective reality versus absolute
objective reality, even though I feel it has relevance. In terms of consuming information an adult
audience should use their own judgement as to whether something is true or not, I disagree with a
concept of a 'ministry of truth' which I beleive to be the ultimate goal of this, in accordance with the
World Health Organisations coming Pandemic Treaty. Politicians are not above wrong doing and/or
corruption and in reality, this is more about controlling information per se, than about actually
protecting anyone (referenced in the Pandemic Treaty as the laughable notion of an 'infodemic').
Seeing my own government - whom I've spent 25 years of my life funding through ever increasing
taxes - beginning to institute the same misbehaviors they're accusing China's Xi and Russia's Putin of
doing is a tiring double standard. Where does this end and how long before life in Australia
resembles living in North Korea. Todays government may give all the assurances under the sun that
there is no dictatorship awaiting us in the future, but Prime Minister Albanese's refusing to uphold
the previous governments low to middle income tax offset, shows that future governments probably
(definately?), will not honour their predecessors policies and/or promises to the voting public. I will
conclude by reinforcing my point that adults should decide for themselves what is true or false and
should not have a 'nanny state', decide for them. As for minors and children, the parents decisions
on censorship should take precident, not the state.

Thank you.

Vincent Booth.
