This Bill enables government bureaucrats and big tech companies to silence and censor
speech that differs or disagrees with the government narrative (or should we call it
government propaganda?).

This Bill will give governments the power to silence religious and political speech that
contradicts prevailing ideologies and political messaging. Apart from wanting to destroy
our democracy and freedom of speech, why would a government shut down debate or
questions challenging their agenda?

I do not see in my reading of the Exposure Draft where there are mechanisms to protect
valid expression of opinion and belief or to ensure that there are clear and defined limits
on suppression of speech.

This Bill sets out a framework to restrict speech that is deemed to be ‘misinformation’ or
‘disinformation’ which is not clearly defined in the Bill, but anything that ACMA
determines is false, misleading or deceptive. Digital platforms such as Facebook and
Instagram, Google and Netflix will be required by ACMA-regulated codes and standards
to police and remove ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’. However, government
communications are exempted from the Bill as are comedy/entertainment programmes,
professional news content, and private messages.

People died and were injured at the hands of Dr Patel, yet no one in the government was
ever charged or held to account for what Patel did, despite the Commissioner finding the
government was covering things up.

This Bill is, to put it simply, significant overreach by the government. A government and
a bureaucracy that wants to be able to do whatever they choose and shut down any
opposition to their agenda, sounds like a communist dictatorship.

This Bill is inconsistent with fundamental freedoms of speech and communication under
international human rights instruments like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

This Bill puts too much power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to silence speech in
the public square without any transparency or accountability.

Nowhere does this Bill require mechanisms that will hold digital service providers liable
for excessive and onerous policing of legitimate speech.

I note in the last few years a number of non-government politicians have had their social
media platforms put on hold for a period of time.

This Bill it appears will build on the silencing of opposing views as displayed in the last
three years of Big Tech shutting down people who questioned the Covid-19 Mandates. It
is clear being vaccinated does not stop one from getting Covid or stop Covid from being
spread. But governments, federal and state, still say people need to keep getting
vaccinated.

I have had several clients whose health was good until they got vaccinated and since then
their health has deteriorated markedly. Is their poor health from being vaccinated? – I am

not a trained professional in this area - but one wonders why they had an adverse reaction
after getting vaccinated and were told by their employer and government that there was
nothing wrong with them.

After having surgery done by Dr Patel, most of my Patel clients were told their problems
were in their head or no one else had had problems with Dr Patel and that they were
lucky to have him as their surgeon.

It seems to me that governments today are hiding the fact people can and do have
adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccines and yet keep telling people they need to keep
being vaccinated.


Another Dr “Death” scandal maybe?


Excluding government-authorised content from this censorship regime is hypocritical
and inconsistent with the values one would expect in a democratic country. How is one
rule for government and another rule for Australians, democratic?

It is very concerning that the Bill gives ACMA excessive powers to compel owners and
private users of digital platforms to provide information and evidence about
misinformation and disinformation. This is a worrying breach of privacy.

The Bill does not provide a sufficient standard of accountability and oversight for misuse
of censorship powers. I wonder, why is this the case?

The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to
freedom of expression are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in
international law for the interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.

The severity of the penalties for failing to comply with the misinformation codes and
standards and for failing to provide evidence requested by ACMA is excessive and will
have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, especially when government can say and do
whatever they want without the same standards of accountability.

It appears that an individual cannot personally be penalised under the Bill if you make a
post that ACMA deems to be ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’. But the Bill
encourages (I say forces) service providers to take internal disciplinary action such as
removing posts or suspending accounts where they deem you to have breached a code or
standards. If the online platforms don’t take such disciplinary actions, they face severe
financial penalties imposed by ACMA. Which in essence is an underhanded way to
control free speech but keep the government and bureaucrats at arm’s length.

Professor Noam Chomsky’s quote sums up my concerns of this Bill: “If you believe in
_freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Goebbels_
_was in favour of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you're in favour_
_of freedom of speech, that means you're in favour of freedom of speech precisely for_
_views you despise. Otherwise, you're not in favour of freedom of speech.”_

The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states the core
defining values of Australian Democracy are:

  - freedom of election and being elected.

  - freedom of assembly and political participation.

  - freedom of speech, expression and religious belief.

  - rule of law.

  - other basic human rights.


Clearly this Bill seeks to undermine the core values of Australian Democracy.


In closing I firmly believe that this Bill will not be in the best interests of Australia and
its citizens, and I urge the ACMA and the Australian government to dig a hole and bury
this Bill with concrete!


Australia does not need anymore erosion of our democracy!


Yours Sincerely,
