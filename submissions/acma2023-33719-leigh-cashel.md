**Authority** **Powers** **Over** **Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation** **on** **Social** **Media**

20 August 2023

Dear Communications and Media Authority,

I write today to express my profound objections to the proposed bill that seeks to grant the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) powers to determine what constitutes misinformation
and disinformation, along with the authority to levy punitive measures against social media companies
that are deemed to be publishing such content. While the intentions behind this proposal may be
noble, the implications for free speech, government overreach, and public trust are deeply concerning.

1. **The** **Ambiguity** **of** **Truth:** One of the foundational issues with this bill is its presumption that
there exists a straightforward, objective measure for determining truth. The nature of truth,
especially in complex socio-political matters, is multifaceted. What one entity deems as
"misinformation" might be viewed by others as a legitimate alternative perspective, or even a
fact that is yet to gain widespread acceptance. History has shown us that many 'accepted
truths' of one era were overturned in the next. To grant any governmental agency the power
to be the arbiter of truth is to set a dangerous precedent. By whose criteria and standards will
this truth be determined?

2. **Governments** **and** **Misinformation:** While governments play a vital role in maintaining order
and governance, it is naive to believe that they are immune to the spread of misinformation.
Governments, like any institution, have their own agendas, biases, and interests to protect.
There have been countless instances globally where governments have been found spreading
misinformation either to further their narrative or to suppress dissent. If ACMA is granted
these powers, what measures are in place to ensure they remain unbiased and are not
influenced by political pressures?

3. **The** **Chilling** **Effect** **on** **Free** **Speech:** One of the cornerstones of a thriving democracy is the
right to free speech. Citizens must be able to express their views, however unpopular or
controversial, without fear of reprisal. This bill, in its very essence, threatens that right. If social
media platforms, under the threat of punitive measures, become overly cautious and start
censoring content that might be even remotely controversial, we risk creating an environment
where people are afraid to speak their minds. This "chilling effect" will stifle debate, hinder
the free flow of ideas, and could lead to an echo chamber where only government-approved
narratives thrive.

4. **Potential** **for** **Overreach:** With the power to define what is and isn't misinformation, and the
authority to penalize those who transgress these definitions, there is a very real risk of this
power being misused. Such laws can easily be weaponized against dissenting voices,
opposition parties, and critical media.

5. **The** **Burden** **on** **Social** **Media** **Companies:** While tech giants have their responsibilities, this bill
might force them into the unenviable and impossible position of being the guardians of 'truth'.
Given the sheer volume of content uploaded every second, it is unrealistic to expect these
platforms to be effective gatekeepers. This would not only be a herculean task but also one
fraught with ethical dilemmas.

6. **Potential** **Erosion** **of** **Public** **Trust:** If the public perceives that their free speech is being
curtailed or that the government is actively suppressing certain narratives, this can lead to a
significant erosion of trust. Trust is the bedrock of any democratic society, and once lost, it can
be incredibly challenging to regain.

In conclusion, while the spread of misinformation and disinformation is a genuine concern in our digital
age, the solution is not to grant sweeping powers to a governmental agency. Instead, the focus should
be on fostering media literacy, promoting open debate, and ensuring that platforms have transparent
mechanisms for content moderation. The proposed bill, in its current form, threatens the very ideals
of a democratic society and risks more harm than good.

I urge the committee to reconsider this proposal in the interest of upholding the democratic principles
that Australia holds dear.

Sincerely,

**Leigh** **Cashel**

Encl.
