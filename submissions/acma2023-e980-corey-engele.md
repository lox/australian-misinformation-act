**Subject:** **Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill**

​I would to express my concern at this proposed Bill. My concerns relate to Government overreach in the guise of
public concern and potential hurtful words being harmful.
Firstly who will determine what is truthful and what is not truthful, what moral grounds will be used? Public opinions,
the opinions of a group of bureaucrats? This legislation will be used to curtail and stop people who hold different
opinions or beliefs to not only the government but other groups who will use this legislation to silence criticism and
differences or opinions. I believe government should keep their oversight to running the country ( which isn’t going
that well is it!) and remove themselves from stopping people who have differences of opinions or beliefs. This is an
attack of free speech disguised as something noble and righteous, yet I feel it’s more sinister and condescending not
to mention controlling!
I would ask you to take the words of Pontus Pilate from the biblical story of Christs crucifixion prior to the mob
calling for it,” WHAT IS TRUTH”. He could not explain it then and the government certainly cannot explain it or tell
us they have the right to tell us what TRUTH is.
Censorship is a slippery slope to totalitarian rule.
I humbly ask that it not be allowed to go ahead.
