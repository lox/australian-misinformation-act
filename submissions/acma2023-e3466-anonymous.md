Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am a proud Australian who lives in the country and has travelled the world for work purposes. Every time I returned
home from overseas I quickly realised how lucky I was to live in Australia which is one of the best democracies in the
world.

The proposed 'Misinformation Bill’ will erode our wonderful democracy. Freedom of speech is one of the pillars of our
way of life and many Australians sacrificed their lives for our freedom. Only autocratic dictatorships deny freedom of
speech and public debate, which is a valued hallmark of our Australian society. It beggars belief that a bill to censor
public debate and discourse is before our Parliament for consideration.

This Misinformation Bill although well intentioned at face value could lead to unexpected
consequences that are not in Australia's or individual Australians best interests.The proposed law has the potential to
do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed. This Bill could lead to corruption through manipulation of
information flows to the wider community!

It is imperative we foster public discussion and debate including criticism of any government mismanagement or poor
public policy that could be covered up should this bill be passed. Freedom of speech enables us to hold governments
to account and have a balanced discussion about issues that affect all of us. This bill if passed will lead to one sided
information flows that could serve ideological, rather than the nations best interests.

When social media companies such as Meta and Twitter who have a global perspective on societies, voice their
concerns over the proposed law because of potential abuse of power, it is time for Australians to act to protect our
fundamental rights. Giving the Government such unrestricted power and Australians potentially no voice to make
them accountable is frightening and could lead to a degradation of our liberty over time. Our fallen diggers must be
turning in their graves.

We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and find the truth to make informed decisions. This
Bill must be rejected so our thriving democracy is preserved.

Please reject this proposed law.
