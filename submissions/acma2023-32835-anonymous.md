Subject: Submission on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
# Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Ms Rowland,

I write to you with deep concern and outrage in regard to the proposed
Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
# Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is my firm belief that this bill demonstrates a lack of respect for the freedom of speech of Australian citizens and has the potential to significantly
harm our democracy.

One of the most alarming aspects of this bill is its creation of two classes of citizens. On
one hand, politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions have the
# power to disseminate information, whether true or false, without restraint. On the other
hand, ordinary citizens, who often possess valuable knowledge and insights on various
topics such as industry insiders, will be disproportionately affected and restricted in their
# ability to express themselves in our democratic society.

The Internet has revolutionized democracy by giving regular people a voice. This bill
poses a significant threat to the power and influence regular citizens have gained
# through this democratic invention. The excessive fines proposed in this bill will result in digital services becoming more restrictive than ever before, stifling the freedom of
speech of individuals and inhibiting open and honest discussions.

Furthermore, it is an impossible task to accurately determine what is true or untrue at all
times. New information constantly emerges that challenges previously accepted facts.


-----

Listing several examples from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the efficacy of masks or
the number of doses required for vaccination, demonstrates the complexity of judging
# information as false or misleading. This legislation, through industry or mandatory
codes, may restrict access to essential information that can contribute to public health
decision-making.

# Additionally, the inclusion of true but possibly misleading or deceptive information in
the scope of removal is deeply concerning. Freedom of speech allows for open and
honest discussions in which people can be wrong and the truth can be debated.
Restricting this freedom under the guise of combating misinformation is a slippery slope
towards censorship.

Even Dr. Nick Coatsworth, a former Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Australia, has raised
serious concerns about the scope and application of this bill. His tweet on 25th June
2023 highlights the inherent challenges associated with implementing such legislation.

Moreover, this bill, intended to protect minorities, may inadvertently result in their
persecution. Progress is often achieved by challenging previously accepted facts, and
minorities are often the ones oppressed by existing political realities. However, this bill
will not provide them with shelter or protection from a system that may push back
against their views.

Furthermore, the delegation of legislative power to private entities outside the direct
# responsibility of Parliament raises constitutional concerns. The proposed arrangement
permits the creation of Misinformation Codes that become law once registered, without
requiring approval by Parliament. This presents an unconstitutional abdication of
legislative power.

# Additionally, the granted power to the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) to enact Misinformation Standards and Digital Platform Rules infringes upon
the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. Limiting legitimate
discussion on matters of public policy, scientific investigation, and debate goes against
the principles of our democracy.

This bill assumes that the government and accredited media and educational
# institutions alone can determine what is true, disregarding the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians. Diversity in viewpoints is essential for the senseÂ­
making process and considering all possibilities. By deplatforming certain views as
misinformation, this bill erodes the foundational principles of democracy and denies
voters access to essential information.


-----

Furthermore, this bill creates a division between citizens. It deems certain individuals,
such as government and government-approved media and educational institutions,
# trustworthy and exempts their content from monitoring. However, it labels others as
untrustworthy, limiting their viewpoints and subjecting them to complex reporting
standards and misinformation reports. This creates an unfair playing field and
incentivizes government-approved journalists to produce favourable news coverage,
compromising the integrity of journalism.

In summary, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023 threatens the freedom of speech of Australian citizens and
undermines the power of the Internet in our democracy. It is crucial to reconsider this
bill and ensure that the voices of ordinary citizens are not silenced or restricted unjustly.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take my concerns into
account and act in the best interest of our democracy.

Yours sincerely,
