This proposed bill to combat “misinformation and disinformation” is the most concerning bill that I have ever heard discussed in
Australia in my seventy five years of reading about our nation's political proposals.

The screaming questions that remain unanswered are who decides what is true and by what standards.?

I realise that the moral beliefs of the majority of politicians have swung away dramatically from those of us who claim to be
Christian; and our grandchildren are well aware that they will have to bring up their children in a world where Christians will be
ridiculed and persecuted by the media, ably abetted by many politicians. They are also aware that Jesus himself warned his
disciples that they would be hated just as he was.

It is blindingly obvious that the teachings of the bible are increasingly hated, and are already branded as 'hate speech' in several
jurisdictions in the western world; and to 'love what God loves and hate what God hates' is to risk becoming more and more
hated by the most vocal and powerful forces in our society.

For example, as the bible teaches, and Jesus confirmed, God created man male and female, and he established marriage as a
union between the two. He classifies all other sexual relationships as sin, and it is an abomination to him when men and women
prefer homosexual relationships rather than what he planned for them. Nevertheless, Jesus died on the cross that we might be
saved from all sin - including sexual sin. As the bible says Jesus died on the cross to deliver us all from the wrath of God.

All that I have said in the last paragraph is hated by those who seem to have control of the media - and, increasingly of politicians
also. It will, no doubt, be considered as 'hate speech', and, furthermore, to publish it as truth will surely soon be classified as
"misinformation and disinformation".

God is not exactly taken by surprise by these events. There is adequate information in the bible, from Genesis to Revelation, to
convince anyone who wants to know the truth, that we are entering the final stages of human history. The God we worship is
totally in control of history (including climate change) and he is working out his beautiful purposes in the midst of a rampant
onslaught of evil.

My kids and grandkids know this, and so do the older ones among my great-grandkids. Of course I am concerned for them as
they face increasing isolation and persecution. However, they know that their lives are ultimately in the hands of God, and he is
teaching us all not to fear what Satan throws at us, but only fear God.

I do fear greatly for politicians who have allowed their minds to be poisoned against the goodness of God, and who are trying
ever more desperately to squeeze him out of our individual and national lives. Each one of us will stand before the Lord Jesus
Christ at the Last Judgement, to give account of our lives. Please, don't let yourselves be sucked in to unquestioningly follow the
forces behind this proposed disinformation bill. When we ultimately face that last judgement, we will stand before the One who
said "I Am The Truth". He will know not only all our acts but also all our thoughts. There will be no 'misinformation' in the way
He judges us.

With respect, I would ask every politician (or their staffers) who look at this petition, to earnestly ask God Himself to show them
what really is the truth. If they are fair dinkum, He will give them an unequivocal answer. Then if they ask Him, He will give them
the courage to stand for the truth even in their discussions concerning this bill.

May God raise up many politicians with a hunger and thirst for righteousness in these challenging times ahead.
