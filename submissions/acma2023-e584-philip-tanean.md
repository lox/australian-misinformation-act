​The Federal Government shows no competency or credibility in dealing with the very concept of truth, taking an
incoherent, opportunistic approach that bends it to its ideological objectives. For this kind of government,
censorship is not about truth but is rather the plaything of the powerful to silence dissent and political diversity. It is
vehemently anti-democratic and has a sordid history of leading to tyranny.
Over the last three years Western governments have modeled incompetence and partisanship in regards to mis/
disinformation, being its worst perpetrators. Governments conclusively cannot be trusted with the truth and freedom
of speech must be guarded at all costs. In light of all of the above, the ACMA legislation is entirely indefensible.

Don’t turn Australia into a totalitarian communist nation. Truth will never be defined by ACMA or government
alone!!!
