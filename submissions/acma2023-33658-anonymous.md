I am not impressed with the proposed establishment of what is effectivley a Ministry of Truth.

What happens when spreading the truth is just as harmful (or more harmful) than spreading
disinformation? Which of the following caused more “harm”? Disseminating the ‘truth’ about
covid-19 or misinformation about covid-19? Which ‘fact’ destroyed the economy? Which ‘fact’ put
people in a state of perpetual fear and panic? Which ‘fact’ destroyed jobs and livelihoods? Which of
the two ‘facts’ gets ACMA’s approval to be disseminated?

In this climate of emerging science, is ‘truth’ today still ‘truth’ tomorrow? What about the person
who is punished for telling tomorrow’s truth today? Is it ok to destroy their career for being ahead
of their time? Australian workplaces were years behind me in deciding that staff should be provided
with a smoke-free workplace. But I was pushed out of a job for wanting the smoke-free workplace
now, not in several years’ time after my lungs had been destroyed by second-hand smoke.

Have we got the best ‘experts’ in place in ACMA and the digital platforms? Do these experts have
intimate knowledge of every subject likely to come up on their platform, so that they can correctly
decide the veracity of opinions expressed?

What about emerging topics? Are they equipped now with the relevant ‘facts’ about covid-24? Or
will they be flying by the seat of their pants as each disaster, situation, topic, etc, emerges? Anthony
Fauci certainly seemed to be flying by the seat of his pants as he struggled to make up his mind if
masks were helpful during covid-19, let alone whether the vaccines were “safe and effective”. But
Fauci was the resident expert.

What about the reverse situation where ‘truth’ is spoken today and then considered politically
incorrect tomorrow? Will the records that ACMA requires digital platforms to keep be used against
the speaker’s retrospectively? What guarantees can you offer of that?

This proposed legislation is too vague. I have no idea what we are signing ourselves up for next year,
let alone 5 years from now. I don’t believe it is possible for you to reassure me that this legislation
will be fairly and intelligently applied in coming
years when we don’t even know what situations it
will be applied to.

The world has had liars, snake-oil salesmen, con
men, etc, since the dawn of time. We’re still all
here despite their best efforts. I’ve been honing
my liar detection skills for decades on mainstream
media news stories, politicians’ promises and
telemarketers. And so far, so good. I don’t want
a questionable ‘authority’s’ help in manoevering
my way through the lies. I’ll rely on my own
brain, thank you very much.

I’d rather take my chances on the liars out there
than authority figures who let their censorship
powers get out of control. This wouldn’t be the
first time I’ve had dealings with ACMA, and their
responses to date have left me convinced that
they can’t be trusted with the power already
invested in them, let alone more power.
