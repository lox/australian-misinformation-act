This bill should never have been brought to the table. The bill is not clear as to what constitutes as
specific misinformation/ disinformation and therefore leaves the door open for any unknowing
Australian to be persecuted for speaking what they know to be true.

If this bill passes, people will be too afraid to say what they think for fear of being penalised and
fined. This is a very slippery slope for democracy in Australia. If this bill passes we are heading into a
state of totalitarian leadership of which there is no turning back from.

Having the Australian government decide what is credible information is not a democracy. It is a
dictatorship. The censorship is on social media is rife as it is without more government overreach
being exerted. I would not approve of this bill even if the government could be trusted and had a
previous track record of being correct about important issues. Because what if they were wrong?
How many lives would be destroyed because of poor government policy and decision-making. This is
clearly another attempt to silence those that speak out against the government-approved narrative
regarding- COVID, climate change, lockdowns, The Voice to Parliament, transgender movement etc.

I do not consent to the Misinformation/disinformation bill, nor should anyone who knows what the
repercussions are.
