    Australians, our democracy, society and economy however the one important takeaway from
    the last couple of years is that the Government can not be trusted as sole arbiter of
    truth.
    The words "Safe and Effective" pushed by every Government mouth should still be ringing
    in peoples ears. Recent evidence has highlighted direct Government censorship of our
    most highly qualified medical experts and general public who did not agree with their
    narrative.
    If society requires any protection it is from Government overreach, Government
    malfeasance, Government influence by financially motivated lobbyists and a corrupted
    media system. Society does not need to be told what can and can't be discussed in the
    town square.
    Past Government actions must serve as a warning, to allow this overreach of power would
    be marching blindfolded into an Orwellian dystopia. Action is required to kerb online
    misinformation and disinformation however when the source it is often Government
    themselves granting additional power is not the answer.
