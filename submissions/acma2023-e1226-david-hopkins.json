    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The draft bill contains inconsistencies regarding ACMA's powers, particularly concerning content removal.",
      "The definitions of 'harm' are broad and subjective, potentially leading to the suppression of free speech.",
      "The bill could be used to silence open debate and dissenting views in a democracy.",
      "The legislation is inconsistent with international human rights standards on freedom of speech."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [
      "Freedom of Speech",
      "Inconsistencies in Legislation",
      "Subjectivity in Defining Harm",
      "Potential for Censorship"
    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "There is an inconsistency here that is not backed up by the draft bill as within the bill the following intent is stated 'empower the ACMA to compel online service providers to censor online speech that it considers to be ‘harmful’!'",
      "The question is how do you define 'harm'? I may hold a different view about gender definitions for example and if I express this it could be interpreted as 'harm' and even 'hatred' yet I can hold that view and show no malice towards those who hold to a different definition.",
      "Herein lies the danger of this draft Bill and it will only be used to silence what should be open debate in a democracy."
