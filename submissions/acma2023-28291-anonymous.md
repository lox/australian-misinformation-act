# The inescapable premise of censorship is that there is a ‘right’ and a ‘wrong’ within information, which only has validity within an OBJECTIVE truth- system. Yet this is entirely contradicts the favoured truth-system of current Left- leaning governments, with a SUBJECTIVE approach to truth ie. where truth is what feels right to each individual.

 There is a glaring hypocrisy in a government holding two irreconcilable systems of truth together, using one as a political cudgel for the sake of embracing the other. This is a major obstacle to the credibility of censorship legislation put forward by this government.

 Any government that wishes to censor on the basis of a fixed and unchanging science has to explain why centuries of philosophy has warned of its achilles heel, and why they think science should no longer be subject to change and debate which censorship destroys.

 The other truth problem for a censoring government is values, like whether marriage should include something other than a human male and female. This is not a scientific question. Values are influenced by each individual’s personality and predisposition in an interplay with survey and scientific data. If governments want to censor aspects of the latter, it must be considered a mechanism of the social control of values and thereby the anti-democratic control of people.

 The Federal Government’s ACMA legislation operates on the assumption that governments can ably divine the truth in any field of inquiry. Unfortunately, over the last three years Western governments have provided irrefutable evidence demonstrating that they indeed are the most guilty of peddling misinformation and disinformation. This puts them in the invidious position of wanting to censor the very type of information that will establish their guilt. This leads to a rank and dangerous hypocrisy.    For this reason, I am strongly opposed to the ACMA legislation.
