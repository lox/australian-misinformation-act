# SUBMISSION:
 New ACMA powers to combat 
 Misinformation and Disinformation

I strongly object to this bill for the following reasons.

The government‟s justification in its own fact sheet accompanying the exposure draft
of the bill illustrates its inherent dangers because of the broad-brushed (ambiguous)
scope of its definitions. In this it states:

“Misinformation and disinformation spread via digital platform services is a
major issue worldwide. The rapid spread of false, misleading and deceptive
information online has resulted in a multitude of harms from disrupted public
health responses to foreign interference in elections and the undermining of
democratic institutions.”

For me, introducing any restrictions that affect: political debate; the public health
response to COVID-19; the supposed foreign interference in elections, and
“undermining” democracy—is abhorrent and totally un-Australian. It also denies
Australians their human rights to free-speech using social media.

The fact that the bill denies individual citizens the right to criticise—yet explicitly
exempts communication being issued from any level of government that may be
considered misinformation or disinformation—demonstrates how Orwellian this law
(if approved) will become.

While the bill‟s penalties won‟t apply to individuals, it will enforce an oppressive
means of suppression of any speech on social media companies.

Digital platforms that do not comply will face substantial penalties—up to, the greater
of, AUD$6.88 million or 5% of global turnover for corporations (in recognition of the
size of digital service providers), and up to $1.38 million for individuals.

**This fact alone means that if one individual breaches this bill with a comment**
**posted on Facebook, and the company (Meta) is fined, that breach being 5% of**
**a $180 billion turnover could become an $9 billion penalty. This is ridiculous!!**

In response to such draconian measures, all social media companies will be forced
to use a broad brush approach when applying the edicts issued from ACMA to stifle
free speech on behalf of the government. The need to stifle most free-speech on
public-interest topics will be necessary for media companies to avoid the extremely
harsh penalties that apply if anyone using their platform breaches this law.

If this bill became „law‟, censorship would most likely affect Climate Change
opinions, as currently experienced by Nobel Prize-winning physicist John Clauser, as
he discovered recently.

In a recent interview with the Epoch Times, he is quoted as saying:

“I am, I guess, what you would call a „climate change denialist,'” Mr. Clauser
told The Epoch Times. His training in science makes him “a little bit different”

The physicist, who also won a third of the Wolf Prize for his quantum
mechanics contributions, shared some of his views on climate during a recent
speech in South Korea soon after his election to the CO2 Coalition‟s board of
directors.

“I believe that climate change is not a crisis,” Mr. Clauser told the audience at
Quantum Korea 2023.

He also described the United Nations‟ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) as “one of the worst sources of dangerous
**_misinformation.”_**

Like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also opposes many government narratives,
Mr. Clauser may find it hard to get his message out there if the opposition
remains sufficiently entrenched. For now, the physicist doesn‟t sound likely to
yield.

“We are totally awash in pseudoscience,” he told The Epoch Times[1].

I recognise that social media is rife with misinformation and disinformation; but the
only way to combat it is to publicly refute it, not censor it.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Australia helped to
draft in 1948 says this:

“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
**receive and impart information and ideas and regardless of frontiers.”**
(Emphasis added.)

If (so-called) democratic governments cannot be held to account through their
populations and the media questioning their actions using free-speech, any
restrictions imposed on free-speech means such governments have become
totalitarian towards their people and therefore remain unaccountable for their
heinous and often illegal actions.

It is for the above reasons that I strongly oppose this bill.

Yours sincerely,
