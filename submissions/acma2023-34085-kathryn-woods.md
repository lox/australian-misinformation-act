**Re:** New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the _Communications_
_Legislation_ _Amendment_ _(Combatting_ _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023)_

Dear Officer,

I write this submission to the proposed _Communications_ _Legislation_ _Amendment_ _(Combatting_
_Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation)_ _Bill_ _2023._

I vehemently oppose the introduction of these new powers to ACMA, in principle and in practice. The
suggestion that a Government regulation body should be given powers to censor the opinions and
information sharing of individuals on social media platforms demonstrates vast over-reach, and a breach
by government not only of the social contract and the right to freedom of speech & expression, but of
international and national law.

In particular, I draw your attention to **Australia’s** **obligations** **with** **respect** **to** **freedom** **of** **speech**
**and** **freedom** **of** **expression.** Australia is a party to the seven core international human rights treaties.
### Of most relevance is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
**Article** **19** **of** **the** **ICCPR** **-** **Freedom** **of** **Expression**

**1.** **Everyone** **shall** **have** **the** **right** **to** **hold** **opinions** **without** **interference.**
2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or
in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.
3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and
responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are
provided by law and are necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order _(ordre_ _public),_ or of public health or morals.

The Bill would give unprecendented & unconstitutional powers to ACMA, to litigate and penalise both
individuals and social media companies, for allowing information sharing. Freedom of speech and
expression is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. The powers contained in this Bill effectively set
up ACMA as Australia’s own Orwellian Ministry of Truth, and Thought Police to boot.
I am shocked that the Australian Government has made moves towards implementing such dystopian
control of its citizens, who once enjoyed the highest standards of democratic involvement in the world.

**Recommendation**

## 1.1 ask for the Government to please provide specific reasons why the various powers granted to
**ACMA** **by** **the** **Bill** **are** **necessary** **for** **the** **purposes** **outlined** **in** **Article** **19** **of** **the** **ICCPR,** **including**
**reasons** **as** **to** **why** **less** **onerous** **approaches** **are** **not** **sufficient.**


-----

There are two other Articles from the ICCPR containing rights which the Bill threatens to impede. First,
**Article** **1** **of** **the** **ICCPR** contains the right of **self-determination,** often referred to as the bedrock of
human rights. That is;

1. All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their
political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.

In today’s world, freely pursuing one’s economic, social and cultural development is a process
intertwined with and dependent on digital platforms, and the internet generally. Most individuals and
most businesses use websites and social media platforms to share information. “Social and cultural
development” necessarily includes the interaction with, and sharing of, ideas online. All of these
processes have become integrated and intertwined. It would be a simplistic and naive view to claim that
restrictions placed on people and their businesses by ACMA with respect to what they can and cannot
post on the internet would not impede on their right to self-determination.

### Article 18(1) is also relevant:

1. Everyone shall have **the** **right** **to** **freedom** **of** **thought,** **conscience** **and** **religion.** This right shall
include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or
in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in worship,
observance, practice and teaching.

Freedom of thought necessarily entails the freedom to express those thoughts, and freedom of
conscience necessarily entails the right to have access to a broad range of information which might
inform that conscience. Forcing independent disseminators of information to comply with codes and
standards imposed from on high does not facilitate an environment where freedom of thought and
conscience are possible.

**Recommendations**
**2.** **The** **Department** **and** **the** **AHRC** **should** **collaborate** **to** **ensure,** **as** **per** **the** **AHRC’s** **statutory**
**function,** **that** **the** **Bill** **is** **compatible** **with** **Australia’s** **human** **rights** **obligations** **at** **international** **law;**

**3.** **The** **Department** **should** **immediately** **release** **the** **Statement** **of** **Compatibility** **for** **public** **scrutiny,**
**and** **confirm** **the** **establishment** **of** **the** **Parliamentary** **Joint** **Committee** **on** **Human** **Rights** **with**
**respect** **to** **the** **Bill;**

**4. Stronger,** **proactive** **protections** **for** **the** **implied** **right** **to** **freedom** **of** **political** **communication;**

**5.** **Include** **Guidance** **Principles** **within** **the** **Bill** **that** **make** **clear** **the** **importance** **of** **freedom** **of**
**speech** **and** **expression,** **and** **which** **force** **ACMA** **to** **acknowledge** **these** **rights** **when** **making**
**decisions;**

**6.** **Follow** **the** **DIGI** **Code’s** **lead** **in** **ensuring** **that** **content** **producers** **should** **not** **be** **compelled** **by**
**Governments** **or** **other** **parties** **to** **remove** **content** **solely** **on** **the** **basis** **of** **its** **alleged** **falsity** **if** **the**
**content** **would** **not** **otherwise** **be** **unlawful.**

In brief, the Bill would enable ACMA three broad powers:
a. to gather information from, or require digital platform providers to keep certain records about matters
regarding misinformation and disinformation;
b. to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to combat misinformation and
disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could register and enforce; and c.

to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation), should a code of practice be
deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms.


-----

The Bill places unacceptable restrictions on any Individual who posts content online, and makes them
subject to the severe civil and criminal penalties that the Bill implements ifthose codes/standards are
breached. This approach is, quite frankly, an unacceptable and inappropriate imposition of executive
regulation on the citizenry ofAustralia. It is a flagrant dismissal of the rights to freedom of speech and
expression Australia has covenanted into protecting. It would render any citizen who chooses to express
themselves in a digital form subject to regulatory frameworks that have not even been created yet,
unilaterally imposed by ACMA, and not subject to meaningful challenge. That is not the way a
democratic society works. It would signal the end of the internet as a free market of ideas and opinions
and render criticism of Government, an essential element of any healthy democracy, vulnerable to civil
and criminal prosecution. This is not the sort of society that I wish our teenage children to be entrapped
by.

### Recommendations:

**7.** **Amend** **the** **definition** **of** **‘digital** **service’** **to** **clarify** **and** **ensure** **that** **an** **individual** **who** **posts**
**on** **a** **social** **media** **platform** **is** **outside** **of** **the** **scope** **of** **the** **Bill’s** **operation.**

**8.** **The** **current** **definitions** **of** **‘Misinformation’,** **‘Disinformation’** **and** **‘Serious** **Harm’** **within** **the**
**Bill** **are** **unworkable.** **Given** **that** **the** **Bill** **rests** **upon** **these** **definitions,** **this** **renders** **the** **Bill** **itself**
**unworkable.** **The** **definitions** **should** **be** **amended** **such** **that** **they** **are** **not** **contingent** **on** **the**
**identification** **of** **“truth”,** **but** **are** **rather** **aimed** **at** **capturing** **content** **that** **is** **of** **a** **criminal** **character,**
**or** **which** **constitutes** **a** **criminal** **offence.**

**9.** **The** **drafters** **of** **the** **Bill** **must** **be** **clear** **in** **their** **intentions.** **At** **present,** **the** **Guidance** **Note** **and** **the**
**Fact** **Sheet** **say** **one** **thing** **whilst** **the** **functionality** **of** **the** **Bill** **suggests** **something** **else.** **This** **will** **result**
**in** **complex** **and** **costly** **litigation;**

**10.** **If** **the** **Bill** **is** **to** **be** **allowed** **to** **pass,** **stronger** **protections** **for** **free** **speech** **must** **be** **incorporated**
**into** **it,** **which** **would** **require** **a** **drastic** **re-drafting** **of** **the** **Bill.** **Anything** **less** **should** **not** **be** **allowed,**
**because** **freedom** **of** **speech** **and** **expression** **are** **such** **fundamental** **rights** **in** **our** **democracy.**

**11.** **Stronger** **checks** **and** **balances** **need** **to** **be** **incorporated** **into** **the** **Bill** **such** **that** **ACMA** **is** **not**
**allowed** **unchecked,** **unilateral,** **unchallenged** **power** **to** **create** **codes,** **rules** **and** **standards;**

**12.** **Statutory** **mechanisms** **for** **review** **and** **challenge** **of** **ACMA** **decisions** **must** **be** **incorporated** **into**
**the** **Bill,** **with** **external** **and** **independent** **oversight** **that** **is** **timely** **and** **efficient;**

**13.** **ACMA’s** **discretion** **should** **be** **limited** **and** **couched** **within** **clear** **parameters** **for** **reasonable**
**assessment** **by** **a** **Court;**

**14.** **The** **Bill** **must** **include** **a** **Clause** **excepting** **the** **provision** **of** **any** **information** **that** **would** **render**
**the** **provider** **in** **breach** **of** **Privacy** **legislation.**

**Conclusions**

When the public is no longer the arbiter of truth, and that role becomes usurped by bureaucrats and
governments, history suggests that the resultant censorship erodes the public's collective trust in
authority.
Governments in Australia have already seriously eroded the public’s trust over the past decade,
particularly the past 3 years. The ball is now in your court to try to regain that trust by serving the
people, not corporate or government agendas. I ask you to cease and desist from the current path of
systematically eroding the human rights that we have enjoyed in this country since Federation.

I fundamentally and vehemently oppose this Bill, and everything it stands for: Government control
### of its citizens. Please do not pass this Bill.

Yours sincerely,

### Kathryn & Jeremy Woods
