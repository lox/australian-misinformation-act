 COMBATING MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION BILL 2023

Note the examples I used below to explain. I do this in the books I write because there is no
policy or law in Australia that allows corruption and/or sabotage to be used in the courts of law
or in government bureaucracies or in Parliament. The people in Australia have a legal right to
talk about injustice in the System and in Parliament because we are supposed to be a democratic
country, not a totalitarian one. When Justice Angel of the High Court investigated Euthanasia in
Australia, he found that Parliament is subject to the law of the land.

I believe that the people in Australia have a legal right to talk about the Genocide of the
reluctant innocent in this country, either on line or anywhere else in particular because President
Vladimir Putin of Russia advised the world that he is a backer for people like me who are in
danger of being murdered by the government’s 3[rd] World nurses and medical staff under
proscribed procedures endorsed in state Euthanasia Laws. That is why Australia might one day
find itself in the International Criminal Courts of law charged with its Crimes against Humanity
and/or Genocide. The Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill before the enquiry is
evidence of Australia’s cover-up.

Genocide is illegal under federal law, but not state law. Section 109 of the Australian
Constitution states that when there is a dispute between state law and federal law as described
below, that federal law prevails. The Attorney-General, however, has not intervened to protect
Australian citizens. The Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill before the Parliament of
Australia is the opposite because it attacks individual people instead of protecting them.

There is some obligation for me to notify and complain to the federal government and to
this enquiry in relation to what is written below because I would be dead if I had not written
letters to all Members of Parliament in 2017 when the Euthanasia Bill was on the table in the
Parliament of Victoria. The cost to me at the time was over two weeks income. Furthermore, I
don’t know if my granddaughter as mentioned below has survived the Systems Abuse that the


-----

government of Australia has inflicted on her unlawfully. Any measure that prevents the public
from talking about the criminality or quasi-criminality of government is a serious matter that
can’t just be hidden under the Secrecy Provisions inbuilt in the Combating Misinformation
_Disinformation Bill before the Parliament of Australia._

……………………………………………………..

NOTE the following email below that I sent to my Member of Parliament, . I
removed some irrelevant parts and added to it for clarification. My Submission to the federal
_Combating Misinformation Disinformation Enquiry can be published._

There might not be any answer to the questions I asked MP because of
the complexity and the administrative and court corruption and sabotage inbuilt in our System of
government and in our courts of law that cannot be resolved or remedied by ordinary
Australians. Notwithstanding that, the media commonly advertises false information to confuse
the public mind. Individuals should be allowed to discuss and publish what needs to be
corrected in the media and in government. The unnecessary complexity in the Bill denies
ordinary Australians their right to free speech and to our democratic right of enquiry. We are not
supposed to be an country where enquiry is not permitted.

The problem is that the Combating Disinformation Misinformation Bill targets ordinary
Australians. Justice Angel of the High Court found that parliament is subject to Law as
mentioned, but there is no means for the ordinary person to bring parliament to account let alone
a government department or a court of law. Not allowing people to communicate even on line
would prevent resolutions being found. That is contrary to the integrity of a democratic country.

I believe that the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill goes beyond the law
and what should be our democratic rights. What that means is that innocent people will be
blamed for speaking up about corruption and sabotage in government as well as the false news
that pervades the media these days. All that is left for the targeted Systems Abuse victims to do
is to write books about any political or government controversy or conspiracy that remains
uninvestigated. This is what I do.

Marketing books these days is commonly done on line. The cruelty and ill treatment
suffered by the vulnerable like me is unacceptable and should be corrected to prevent further
administrative and/or court Systems Abuse being inflicted on the people. Government
Departments are known to break the law to establish control and manipulation of the people.
They also do that to enforce parliament to change the law according to their administrative
requirements. The Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill before parliament appears to
be a mechanism to allow government bureaucracies and the courts of law in Australia to
continue breaching parliamentary legislation so that they can get away with it.

When the administrative elite find that their questionable administrative strategies work,
they inflict their strategies on a wider population. I can say this because I studied in universities
for well over ten years and obtained four qualifications including a Masters. Although that was
in education, it was also in government administration. The ordinary person is the victim. Not


-----

allowing conversations amongst the people will invariable lead to public unrest and insurrection
which amounts to Civil War. Publication and social media today allow government corruption
and sabotage to be exposed to the public as well as the false news that is advertised in the media.

The next step after banning public conversations on line is to restrict free speech and

other democratic rights even as imbued in our Constitution. The said Bill is extremely dangerous
as per the above circumstances.

……………………………………………………………………..

Many years ago I became aware about the Fiction Club that operates in the United States

of America and possibly in our country. I made an effort to speak to a member of that
Disinformation Misinformation ‘Tall Story’ Club. I have mentioned this in my books. The
members are organized and trained to publish and/or broadcast false news in various ways to put
fear into the mind of the public. The point is that the public needs to discuss these matters to
overcome that fear. One way to do that is through publication and social media as well as
talking to each other about these matters. Very few people are aware that such clubs and
organizations exist. Those organizations are somewhat professional.

The problem is that the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill does not target

that political and Tall Story group or maybe other groups that are organized in a somewhat cold
war military fashion in the community and on the internet and elsewhere to intervene in political
matters and in parliamentary elections. If the public was aware that such Tall Story groups
operate on the internet and in the community or elsewhere, the problem would be somewhat
resolved.

The undercover political Fiction Club that unveils false news to the public uses ignorance

as a Working Tool. A Combating Misinformation Disinformation Act in parliamentary
legislation would assist them in their deception because of the inability of the public to discuss
their false claims and ambitions and make their deception obvious.

The Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill does not restrict these organizations

because they are professional. The problem is that the public is being blamed for creating false
news controversies when it is not the public that is causing the problem. My concern is that
words like racism, hatred, fascism and such are used as weapons in the cold war that divides our
country and our parliaments.

I am aware, for example, that the Woke platform is designed as a cold war Marxist

operation to disrupt our communities with discrimination propaganda as well as L.G.B.T.+
propaganda—i.e. the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender propaganda that has infiltrated our
schools. The government is not doing anything to counteract and put a stop to their propaganda
that destroys family values and personal relationships.

Discrimination theories that are outlined in the International Human Rights agenda have

gone beyond the intentions of the United Nations and the right of the people to have a say.


-----

Opinion Polls and the Parliamentary Vote have been used politically in Australia to discount the
vote of the people, unconditionally and without merit. The ordinary person is not at fault. That
is why the Combating Disinformation Misinformation Bill is undemocratic and legally
questionable.

The complexity of the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill imposes
unrealistic and possibly illegal restraint on our right to free speech including our right to publish
what happens in the Family Court provided names are not used.  I did this in my published
books as is my legal right.

I won that right to publish provided names are not used in 1998 when I stood for
elections to Federal Parliament. My name then was Meret Field. I am concerned that the said
Bill overshadows our otherwise legal right to free expression and to explain the misgivings that
discredit the integrity of our country.

With respect from  (Ms) Meret-Field Sally-Brown

## EMAIL to MP

**Meret Field <** **>**

Tues, Jul 25, 5:01PM (21 hours ago)

TO

My Dear Member,
I am registered for voting at in . I
believe that this is your electorate. I am writing to you about the Combating Misinformation
_Disinformation Bill on the table in Parliament because of your undated letter to me that was_
posted on 12th June 2023.

My concerns are

(1) the source of the enormous amount of false news in the media, and

(2) the misinformation / disinformation provided by the Parliament of
Victoria, and

(3) the practice in state governments of documenting numerous criminal claims in the Mental
Health System because they cannot be documented in any Police or Court System as such
because they are not true, and

(4) the use of Krytocracy in the courts of law to reduce parliamentary legislation to a nothing,


-----

and

(5) government child stealing including the practice in Victoria of running state law in contest
with federal law in both the Children's Court and the Family Court with opposing orders
made. Obeying one order means disobeying the alternative opposing order. I am a Victim as
are two of my grandchildren, and

(6) the absolute medical orders that extend to the death of a child that are made under federal
Family Law legislation because they cannot be made in the Children's Court because of
Child Welfare Legislation and/or Children's Court Orders in place.

The 3 year old child,, was one such victim. The Coroner in Victoria hid the
absolute Family Court Order that denied the sick child access to doctors of medicine in his
Coroners File. The said Family Court Order was not placed in the Public File. I explained these
things in my book entitled, Matriarch and World War III - A 9/11 Incursion: Internal State
_Terrorism in Australia, as well as other legally questionable Internal State Terrorism methods_
used by the administrative system in our country, AND

(7) the fact as found by the then Family Court judge, Justice …………., that a judge cannot
make an illegal order even when she does NOT have jurisdiction to make orders. The words
‘must not’ was used in Family Law instead of the word ‘cannot’. That is the legally
questionable loophole that targets vulnerable children and their families without compromise.

NOTE that Justice ……….. was able to make orders because she did not mention the two
judgments of the Full Courts of the High Court of Australia in her judgments although those said
High Court judgments stated that the child was a child under Children's Court Orders. That was
the legally questionable loop-hole in the law that overshadowed and defied parliamentary
legislation in place as well as the binding nature of higher judgments in the same case.

NOTE also that Justice ………. told my to divorce. Neither
have done that. They are still legally married even after thirty or more years of separation. I
WAS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS in both the Children's Court and the Family Court.

Please advise if the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Act 2003 will mean that
an Australian can not mention the blatant Krytocracy of the courts of law in this country and the
corruption and sabotage built into the System or the fact that absolute medical orders are made
against very young children in the courts of law even though those medical orders extend to the
death of the child as in the examples in my books. I used these types of examples in my books as
well as the fact that innocent aged people like me who do not want to die are put into the ………
Ward of the …………….. Hospital in country Victoria and asked every day if they want to
commit suicide. Anyone who says ‘Yes’ once is murdered with a lethal injection regardless of
their very loud NO, NO, NO, NO objections.

I explained in my books that the euthanasia Premier of Victoria, ………..,,, endorsed the
_World Euthanasia Movement’s propaganda in parliamentary legislation and copied the methods_
and steps Hitler used to murder millions of people that amounted to the Holocaust that was found


-----

to be a Crime Against Humanity in International Law. I am notifying and complaining to the
federal Parliament of Australia that the said Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill has
the inadvertent outcome of covering up Genocide in this country. I am legally correct to use the
word Genocide because President Vladimir Putin of Russia mentioned Genocide as one of his
reasons for invading Ukraine on 24[th] February, 2022 and for using the military might of Russia
to wrecking Ukraine.

……………………………………………..

Delinquency in the courts of law is not a crime in this country even though
died when she was three years old from the infection of her sexual organs because she was
denied access to doctors of medicine by the Family Court.. I can mention the child’s name
because she is dead. The dead don’t have any rights in law.

The doctor who did the autopsy and gave evidence in the Coroner's Court was not
permitted to investigate the child's sexual disease. The child's mother ………….., was not
permitted to give evidence in the Coroner's Court. She told me that she wanted to give evidence
just before she was whizzed away to a mental hospital to prevent her from giving evidence in the
Coroner's Court. I am a witness and have explained these things in my books.

I read 's file and applied to be a party to proceedings in the Coroner's Court.
The child was denied access to doctors of medicine by Family Court Order absolutely just like
although was very sick, just like,
because of the infection of her sexual organs. The matter is complex. Someone found a way to
give penicillin so that she would not die like, but that was illegal.

The death of both children was considered to be in the best interest of those children in
the Family Court. There is no child welfare law in the federal jurisdiction to assist judges. Child
Welfare is a state matter, not a federal matter. Justice …….. of the Family Court could not
understand because she did not have any children of her own. In that respect she was not
properly qualified for the job. Why shouldn't the public have a right to talk about the
inadequacies of judges???

I had applied to the Attorney-General for legal aid for one of my cases in the High Court
of Australia, but was refused because the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to make orders
under Family Law Legislation because the child in question was a child under Children's Court
Orders. The matter is complex.

Neither has ever applied for divorce. They are still
legally married although separated. The Child Welfare case was in the divorce court, the wrong
court. The fact that might die because of the absolute medical
order made against her that prevented her being taken to a doctor of medicine was not considered
because the court was a divorce court, not a medical court or a child welfare court.


-----

’s absolute medical order that was made in the Family Court prevented her
from being examined by a doctor of medicine when she was very ill and near her death bed.
That fact was not considered because that absolute medical order was made in the divorce court,
the Family Court, not in a medical court or a child welfare court. Because neither ’s
mother nor father had married, the proceedings in the Family Court were illegal just like the
proceedings in ’s case.

Justice ……….. refused to allow a debate about jurisdiction and refused to investigate
’s parentage because her step-father said that he had no likeness to the child.
Justice ……. ignored the fact that a man who has no likeness to a child could not be the child's
biological father. The magistrate in the Children’s Court in Victoria also refused to investigate
the child’s parentage. That is apparently why she refused to investigate how the step-father
obtained possession of the child. According to the Accommodation Order that my daughter
obtained in the Children’s Court, my son-in-law had no legal right to be with the child unless he
was supervised. He wasn’t supervised even when the Federal Police gave the terrified child to
him. The police admitted that the child was terrified when they dragged her from her mother’s
car on the circular highway that runs around the Parliament House of Australia in Canberra.

The Federal Police gave the said although he was not supervised.
They did that because, the child’s step-father, gave them the legally questionable
warrant to arrest the child. The Family Court issued a warrant for the child’s arrest after she was
arrested, not before. The conditional order that made for the arrest of the child
was not fulfilled and could not be fulfilled even when Justice Treyvaud made that order. The
Child Welfare Department of Victoria could not file a statement in the Family Court that it
would look after the child after her arrest because the Children’s Court gave the child to her
mother, not to them or to her step-father.

I fought cats and dogs with about that matter in the Family Court. No
other litigant was in the court room at the time. died shortly after our cat and
dog fight. His death was apparently the undercover reason that an investigation of his errors in
law was not permitted. Justice ……… found that he had erred in law, but refused to correct his
mistakes leaving my granddaughter without any hope of being released from her false arrest by
the Federal Police.

A democratic people should be allowed to talk about these things as explained below:

Her Honor Justice …...... found that she did not have jurisdiction to make orders because of

(a) the Children's Court Orders in place, and because

(b) the Full Court of the Family Court refused to investigate 's false arrest by
the Federal Police when she was four years old because the Family Court did not have
jurisdiction to make orders because was a child under Children’s Court
Orders.

made orders for the arrest of my grandchild when she was four years


-----

old although my then barrister advised him that the child was a child under Children’s Court
Orders. The word used in court was 'arrest', not 'detained'.

died a day or so after I fought him cats and dogs all by myself in the
Family Court. There was no other litigant in the court room at the time. I can mention his name
because he is dead. The dead have no rights in law.

The said child has never been released from her false arrest. She was put in a mental
hospital when she was 18 years old and is not permitted to see any of her biological family, that
is, if she is still alive.

We are supposed to have a legal right in a democracy to discuss the above matters
without breaching a law. I understand that the proposed Combating Disinformation
_Misinformation Act will prohibit any such discussion or any matter that establishes that the_
Democratic System is a failure. Where is the Justice??????

………………………………………………

False news is quite clearly created by a political movement, not the general population,
yet, the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill seems to be aimed at the people in
general. What this means is that the average person can't discuss the false news in the media as
per our assumed democratic right to free speech, let alone the blatant corruption in the courts of
law in Australia or the sabotage of government departments. The internet is an integral part of
social discussion these days.

I am aware that free speech is only available to the press. Individual people are targeted
by psychiatrists, social workers and the like if they disagree with government propaganda and
can be put in mental hospitals and drugged or murdered under Euthanasia Laws for not agreeing
with the government. I am a witness and have explained all of these things in my book
_Euthanasia Rebutted: NO 'right to life' in Australia. It will be published soon. My Pen name is_
Daisy Snow.

The following happened to me in late 2020.

because I tried to go to my unoccupied home in South
Australia when the borders were closed. I was at No Fixed Address in Victoria at the
time. Because I pay my rates in South Australia, I had a legal right to go home, but was
not permitted to do that simply because I was put in a mental hospital instead. Like
everyone else I was asked every day if I wanted to commit suicide. Anyone who said
‘Yes’ just once was murdered with a lethal injection by
regardless of their very loud "NO,NO, NO, NO" screaming. They were not there the next
day.

When I became fully aware of the correct government procedures that were being used to
murder reluctant hospital patients, I objected to their everyday suicide question simply
because I had written letters of objection to every Member of Parliament when the


-----

Euthanasia Bill was on the table in the Parliament of Victoria in 2017. Anyone who
answered ‘Yes’ to the everyday suicide question just once was regarded as having a
terminal illness and was murdered as a matter of course by .
. I was actually kicked out of because I had
written those letters to all Members of Parliament.

The meaning of a conscientious objection was not written in the Euthanasia Act in
Victoria. Nevertheless, my letters of objection to all Members of Parliament could hardly
be called anything, but a conscientious objection. That is why I was kicked out of
. If I had not written letters of objection to all Members of Parliament
when the Euthanasia Bill was on the table in the Parliament of Victoria, I would be dead,
murdered by .

People should be able to talk about the government procedures used to murder the
innocent who had not committed a crime and the unsuspecting in this day and age. I understand
that the said Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill would not allow such a discussion.
Am I correct?

President Vladimir Putin of Russia was right about Genocide in our country, that is, in
Western countries. Federal Parliament, however, never mentions the actual reasons that explain
why Putin invaded Ukraine. Genocide was one of them. Because Putin said that he is a backer that is for innocent people like me who are in danger of being murdered under Euthanasia Laws
in Australia, there is always the possibility that the Euthanasia Premier of Victoria, ……….,
might one day face the International Courts of Law charged with his Crimes against Humanity or
alternatively, Genocide. I should be able to mention the name of the euthanasia Premier because
he advocated for the death of innocents in public as well as in parliament.

A democratic people should have a legal right to discuss these things particularly because
of the failure of the Parliament of Australia to address the actual reasons that Russia provided to
the world about the reasons why it’s military invaded Ukraine and is wrecking Ukraine.

When I was in that mental hospital in late 2020, I asked why I was there, that is, in that
hospital. A 3rd World Psychiatrist advised me that I was there because I wrote the (published)
book Matriarch and World War III: Internal State Terrorism in Australia. The hyphen and
words ‘- A 9/11 Incursion’ in the title of my book was added to my updated 2[nd] edition.  I was
one of those people in Melbourne who knew about 9/11 before that event actually happened.  I
explain these things in my books. The federal Parliament of Australia did not ask for
submissions although the fact that some people knew about 9/11 before it actually happened was
disclosed on the radio in Victoria.

I am sufficiently educated to write that Matriarch and World War III book, but the
did not agree. I have four university qualifications
including a Masters to my name. I obtained the last two at Monash University in Victoria. The
point is that the government uses tax-payers' money to do what it wants to do, sometimes without
any necessarily consultation with the people, as is supposed to be our democratic right. We
should have a legal right to talk about these things.


-----

I understand that the Labor Party only has to get two more votes to pass the said Bill and
that the Senate won't or can’t review the Bill because the Labor Party has the majority vote in the
Senate. Parliament therefore doesn't function according to theory and is a sham.

A democratic people should be able to talk about the failures of Parliament. I mentioned
many of these failures in my said Matriarch and World War III book and my Updated One
_Matriarch and World War III - A 9/111 Incursion: Internal State Terrorism in Australia. I also_
mention these things in my podcasts. Please advise.

It seems that the said Bill will prevent people like me from speaking the truth in a podcast
on the internet when the truth conflicts with court or bureaucratic corruption or questions
parliamentary legislation. If that is correct, the same would apply to authors, like me, who write
books about

(a) the failures of democracy, and

(b) to explain how Internal State Terrorism works in Australia.

NOTE that I have an Internal State Terrorism Constitutional Matter properly filed in
the Supreme Court in Adelaide, South Australia, but that I am not allowed a verbal defense.
The judiciary of the Supreme Court has never allowed an investigation of my application and
appeals and has never allowed me to speak about my applications. The matter has been left
unresolved.

Justice ……. of the Supreme Court in Adelaide said that
when I have never been in jail and have never had a husband who died,
I have never been charged with murder anywhere. Police Officer ……….. of South Australia
was the informer who had it documented in the Mental Health System in South Australia that

when none of that was true.

I was also put in in late 2022 because of the
alleged murder of my husband. That is the 2nd time that I had been
because of the alleged murder of my husband. There is no such thing as an alleged murder. The
Australian people should have a right to talk about the failures and the Administrative Systems
Abuse that targeted vulnerable people in this country. Like me, they are not necessarily
permitted a defense in any way shape of form even in a court of law or a tribunal as is my
experience.

I understand that the
when that did not happen anywhere. The said Tribunal did not have any
evidence to substantiate its claims. There are a number of other Internal State Terrorism matters
that I mentioned in my Matriarch and World War III book. What I explain in my book is that
World War III is a collection of Civil Wars all around the world.


-----

Civil War begins when a country attack the people as is what is happening in Australia in
this period of history. I certainly believe that the said Combating Disinformation Misinformation
Bill is a Working Tool that is designed to attack people illegally. Justice Angel of the High
Court found that even parliament must abide by the law. What I am saying is that passing this
said Bill amounts to Parliament acting illegally. I am stating this now so that I can take a case to
court if necessary. Parliament has been warned that it is acting illegally.

Australia deceives the world by saying that no one is above the law in Australia when
that is not true. Australia also deceives the world by saying that anyone charged with murder has
a legal right to a defense in a criminal court of law when that claim is not exactly true as
explained.

**NOTE that I won the right to publish to the public provided names are not used in**
**1989 when I stood for Federal Elections with the Abolish the Family Court Party. Does**
**this mean that the Combating Misinformation Disinformation legislation will overshadow**
**that right??? Please advise.**

I used Internal State Terrorism' as the subtitle of my 1st book - Matriarch and World
_War III - because I describe numerous illegal doings of the government of Australia in my_
books. There is no policy or parliamentary legislation in place that allows corruption or sabotage
in law. Justice Angel of the High Court found that parliament must abide by the law, but there is
no means to force any parliament to do that in this country. I am fully aware that neither the
Parliament of Australia nor the Attorney-General abides by the law as in the following case:

and I once had the largest file in the office of the federal AttorneyGeneral. My name then was Meret Field. Nearly all Members of Parliament wrote to the
Attorney-General about the illegal doings of the Family Court and the false arrest of my
then by the Federal Police and the fact that the child had an
untreated sexual disease because she had been sexually abused and sodomized and as it
turns out just like . The Federal Police refused to investigate without a
Family Court Order.

The Full Court of the Family Court refused to investigate and therefore refused to make
an order for the release of the child because it did not have jurisdiction to investigate or
make orders. Justice …………… did not agree with the Full Court of the Family Court
and as said, did not accept the judgments of the Full Courts of the High Court of
Australia that were before her. Her honor subsequently breached the binding nature of
judgments of higher courts in the same case. That is why she made orders and
consequently refused to release the child from her false arrest by the Federal Police.

The then child has never been released from her false arrest although Australia claims
that someone who was falsely arrested will be released from that false arrest. The
Australian People should have a legal right to discuss the said ‘criminality’ that is a
Working Tool in government and that proves undoubtedly that there is no integrity in the
government system in Australia. The word used in the Family Court was ‘arrest’ NOT
‘detained’.  The then child was put in a mental hospital for depression when she was 18


-----

years old.  She is not permitted to see any of her biological relatives at all. The stepfather still has total control of my granddaughter, that is, if he did not take her overseas
and leave her there.

NOTE that Justice ……… denied my granddaughter the protection of the Child
Welfare Legislation of Victoria and the Children’s Court Orders in place by making legal
orders without jurisdiction. Children who are under a Minister of Parliament and/or are
foster children are released when they are 18 years old. has never
been released from her false arrest.

The government Systems Abuse to is evidence that Australia is
not a humanitarian country. There is no other country in the world that treats its children
as badly as does Australia. I won the right to publish these things when I stood for
federal parliament elections in 1998 provided names are not used. I have done this. A
politicians name can be used legally when he goes public as did the euthanasia Premier of
Victoria.

The whole world should have a legal right to talk about government deception in
Australia. is not the only child to suffer so profoundly. The only
difference between the government Systems Abuse of my granddaughter and other
children in Australia is in the details. I have advised that my daughter and I once had the
largest file in the office of the Attorney-General, but to no avail. The numerous Members
of Parliament who wrote to the Attorney-General meant nothing to the Attorney-General.
That is further evidence that Australia is not a humanitarian country and that democracy
in this country is a sham—a façade and a swindle. The said bill under discussion is
evidence of that.

Australia condemns China for assumed low human rights standards, but commits
extreme cruelty and ill treatment and even torture to selected children and selected people
it targets illegally or unlawfully in this country. The length of time that this cruelty and
ill treatment goes on can only be called torture. The given fact that Australia tortures its
own people should be a matter for world discussion because of the illusion Australia
provides to the world that it is a humanitarian country when it is not.

I was not permitted to appeal even though Justice …….. breached the binding
nature of the judgments of higher courts in the same case – two judgments from the Full
Courts of the High Court of Australia that found that the child was a child under
Children’s Court Orders. That meant that Justice ……… did not have jurisdiction to
make orders.

The fact that have not divorced and have never
applied for divorce is further evidence that Justice ………. did not have jurisdiction to
make orders and neither did the other Judges of the Family Court. The federal AttorneyGeneral who awarded Judge …….. the Order of Australia was aware of these things.
People should therefore have a legal right to talk about the high level criminality of the
Parliament of Australia.


-----

I understand that the House of Representatives called Chief Judge ……… to
parliament to explain, but nothing happened. The then Attorney-General wrote a letter to
me to explain that he could not intervene because the integrity of the Family Court was at
stake. The House of Representatives had investigated. I was told that the Child Welfare
Department of Victoria was running state law against federal law with opposing orders
made. The House of Representatives found that the Attorney-General was the only
person in Australia who could intervene. As said, he refused to intervene because the
integrity of the Family Court was at stake.

The Attorney-General who awarded by
ignoring her delinquency and deception and disrespect for parliamentary legislation, is
further evidence that he supported Justice ………………’s blatant breach of Family Law
and the fact that she made orders knowingly without jurisdiction and that she breached
the binding nature of higher courts in the same case including the Full Courts of the High
Court of Australia.

The Combating Misinformation Disinformation Enquiry should take note of the
inadequacy of the Combating Misinformation Disinformation Bill before it and any
breach of International Human Rights or good will and the opposed rights of the
democratic people before the enquiry.

The outcome of the whole ordeal about as mentioned above
was that the Attorney-General knighted / awarded Justice ………… with the Order of
Australia. This was apparently because she, her Honor, found a legally question way to
overshadow parliamentary legislation and the binding nature of higher court in the same
case - that is, of the Full Courts of the Family Court and the Full Courts of the High
Courts of Australia. Ah! That is by NOT mentioning the judgments of higher courts in
the same case in her Family Court Judgment about my grandchild.

Note that Justice ………..’s Family Court judgment was not about
because they have never applied for divorce and are still legally married
even to this day. Her honor’s judgment was solely about my very young granddaughter
although the Family Court is not a child welfare court. That said judicial loophole in law
is proof that Justice ……….. maneuvered sufficient power to be above the law just like
Police Officer ………… in South Australia and Justice ……… of the Supreme Court of
South Australia.

John Howard and a particular Labor Prime Minister lied to the world when they
said that no one is above the law in Australia, when clearly that is not the case. (I cannot
just now remember the name of the said Labor Prime Minister who agreed with John
Howard some time later.)

PLEASE ADVISE if the fact that Prime Ministers and/or any government official
who lies to the world could be discussed by the people themselves if the Combating
_Misinformation Disinformation Bill is passed in parliament._

If that Act is passed in parliament, further steps will then be taken in parliament at

some time in order to make reforms to the Act as is the practice in the parliaments in this
country. The Reforms will ultimately disallow and criminalize free speech in Australia.
This action will be seen in the Public Arena as illegal, just like the Genocide that is
happening in the …….. Ward of the …….. Regional Hospital in Victoria. I explained
these Euthanasia and Genocide matters in my book Euthanasia Rebutted: NO ‘right to
_life’ in Australia. As said, I was and am sufficiently qualified to write that book._
