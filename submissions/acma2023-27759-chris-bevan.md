**RE: MISINFOMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL COMMENTS**

Dear Sir/Madam

**‘Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as**
**well as to our democracy, society and economy.’**

First of all, was this an idea coming from the constituents of an MP seat? I highly doubt it. You are
selected in this position to represent the will of the people, not to distribute your ideas to
parliament.

This proposal, although sounding soft and stating that subjected misinformation or disinformation
will be unable to be stopped, I fear that this will be the beginning of further action to quash anything
that goes against the government’s narrative.

Will this mean the injection of a Ministry of Truth the same as the one in the novel 1984?

What is truth? What about voicing your opinion and honest debate? The past three years we have
seen nothing but misinformation and disinformation from the government. So, out of this bill, who
will determine what is true and what is false? This is too much power for one body. How can ACMA
balance freedom of speech when online data censorship is already at a record high?

This bill must not pass through. I cannot support this proposal. For once, start listening to the people.
You can start with all of the vaccine injured from the recent worldwide vaccine trial where informed
consent was not applicable!

Yours sincerely,

Chris Bevan
