Submission regarding new ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation.

Dear ACMA

_As an Australian, I do not, personally, wish to be “protected” from information. I would prefer to use_
_my own discernment and fact-checking when processing information from any source, whether_
_digital platforms, the “professional” media, government agencies or NGOs. I don’t wish to have_
_digital platforms, the ACMA or the Government influence what information may be viewed, via the_
_application of penalties and fines._

_Rather than suppressing or censoring the offending information or accounts, my preference would be_
_to have the digital platforms apply labelling or disclaimers to flag potential misinformation or_
_disinformation. This way, freedom of speech and access is preserved. In addition, a link to the open,_
_transparent and well-referenced “truth’’ could be provided. In addition, Twitter community notes and_
_YouTube video comments also already allow users to disagree with, or correct, potentially false_
_content._

_In my opinion, the main issue with this Act is the subjective viewpoint of what may constitute_
_misinformation, disinformation and harm. If misinformation and disinformation are defined to be_
_false, misleading or deceptive information, then the ACMA, the digital platform or the complainant_
_should be able to prove, via an independent arbitration process, that the information is false,_
_misleading, deceptive and harmful. For example, by providing hard evidence, data and referenced_
_studies. In the same way, the digital platform, publisher or end user should be able to argue that the_
_information is not false or may not be false, by providing similar evidence or demonstrating personal_
_experience. Please could an independent arbitration process, to decide the validity and harm of_
_information, be added to the Act?_

_Alternatively, if the ACMA or the digital platform decide to maintain a list of what they consider to be_
_current misinformation or disinformation, then this list needs to be contestable by the publishers and_
_their end users. The list should be published by the ACMA/digital platform and there should be open_
_discussion with the Australian public and an arbitration process to challenge and amend the list._
_Perhaps a digital forum could be established where Australia can freely debate what is_
_misinformation or disinformation, without censorship (one account per voting adult)? This would_
_provide equity of input to the consensus. Please could this be added to the Act?_

_Many posts on digital platforms contain opinions, personal experiences or religious beliefs. Do these_
_need to be controlled if the digital platform thinks they may be inaccurate? Given that opinions,_
_personal experiences or beliefs are not defined in the Act then they should be excluded (or defined). I_
_would also propose that defamatory or abusive content should be defined and treated separately in_
_this Act so that different rules and actions can apply._

_What is the purpose of the ACMA requesting records and reports from digital platforms? Is this to_
_monitor compliance with the Act, or is it to collect information on companies and individuals? Please_
_add into the Act, how the ACMA and the Government will be using these records?_

_Penalties: the penalties for non-compliance seem quite harsh – up to 25000 penalty units or 5% of_
_turnover and 12 months’ imprisonment per infringement. These appear disproportionate? As a_
_comparison, the ACMA only imposes 500 penalty units if a household product (such as a baby_
_monitor), doesn’t comply with electromagnetic energy emission rules._

_The MPs voting on this Bill should consider whether these measures or penalties are proportionate_
_and appropriate when applied to just one sector of the media. They should also consider future_
_governments, from a different political party, who may utilise this Act and the ACMA’s influence to_
_control information on a particular topic. They should also consider if voting for this Bill is a vote-_
_winner in the next election._

_In my opinion, this Act could have the effect of removing some digital platforms and services from_
_Australian view as it will not be practically possible to monitor or report on the accuracy of all content_
_and posts. Algorithms will need to act as a drag net, capturing accurate & true information along_
_with suspected misinformation or disinformation, in order to avoid penalties and fines. Is the purpose_
_of this Act to remove Australian access to these platforms so that the Government can have better_
_control of information?_

_Prior to the digital age, we used to have two sayings: “don’t believe everything you read in the_
_newspapers” and “never trust a politician”. However, this Act exempts “professional news services”_
_and governments from mis and dis information rules, and now assumes that they are the sources of_
_truth? The existing Codes for the professional media do not appear to prevent bias, conflicts of_
_interest or personal opinions from influencing the information presented._

_Let’s look at a scenario: a government minister misallocates public funds due to a conflict of interest._
_They can be dishonest about this (or “spin”), with little consequence. However, if questions and_
_concerns are posted on a digital platform, they could be suppressed as misinformation because the_
_government is classed as the better source of truth? This is good for politicians, corporate donors,_
_lobbyists, foreign allies and the sponsors of commercial media but not so good for the taxpayers._

_I think most people understand that this Bill will increase the Government’s ability to censor and_
_manipulate available information; they will trust their politicians and bureaucrats even less and will_
_understand that the “professional” and digital news is approved content only. The Government needs_
_to be careful to avoid overreach and the alienation of those Australians who would like to use digital_
_platforms to share ideas. I believe that most people would agree that increased Government control_
_of information is a threat to our democracy._

_Thank you._
