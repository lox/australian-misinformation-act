## 1 Introduction

1. The Australian Human Rights Commission (Commission) welcomes the
opportunity to make this submission to the Department of Infrastructure,
Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts
(Department) on an Exposure Draft of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023
(Exposure Draft Bill).

2. The key question that arises when considering any legislation that aims to
address the growing challenge posed by misinformation and disinformation
is whether it strikes an appropriate balance between combatting
misinformation and disinformation on the one hand, while sufficiently
protecting freedom of expression on the other.

3. The Commission acknowledges the increasing need to combat
misinformation and disinformation, but considers that the Exposure Draft Bill
in its current form provides insufficient protection for freedom of expression.
While there is a need for legislation aimed at combatting misinformation and
disinformation, the current Exposure Draft Bill does not presently strike the
right balance.

## 2 Combatting misinformation and disinformation

4. The Commission recognises the potential harms caused by misinformation
and disinformation, and the need for Australia to respond to these risks.

5. [In the Commission’s recent submission to the Senate Select Committee on](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/legal/submission/foreign-interference-through-social-media)

Foreign Interference through Social Media, the Commission emphasised that
‘misinformation and disinformation can have devastating effects on human
rights, social cohesion and democratic processes. Indeed, this can be the very
purpose intended by the release of disinformation.’[1]

6. At the same time, there are examples around the world of information being
opportunistically labelled as ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ to
delegitimise alternative opinions and justify censorship. For example, the
Center for International Media Assistance have examined what they describe
as the global ‘proliferation’ of national laws designed to combat
misinformation and disinformation in recent years. The Center expressed
concern about the potential for these laws to be ‘weaponised’, resulting in a
stifling of independent media and weakening of digital rights.[2]

7. There is a clear need to combat misinformation and disinformation, however
there is also a real risk of different perspectives and opinions being targeted
when doing so. Robust safeguards for freedom of expression must form part
of any measures taken to combat misinformation and disinformation in order
to ensure that Australia’s democratic values are not undermined.

8. This reflects the warning by the former U.S. ambassador to the UN Human
Rights Council, Eileen Donahoe, that ‘an ominous risk also arises when
democratic governments responding to digital disinformation undermine
their own democratic values’.[3]

9. Particular care must be taken when attempting to regulate online content,
given the central importance of online platforms to our public discourse. For
example, the Senate Selection Committee on Foreign Interference through
Social Media recently observed:

Whether we like it or not, social media platforms are today not just the
dominant communication channels in modern economies, they constitute
the public square for democracies. They are the place where news is first
reported, contentious issues are debated, consensus is formed and public
policy decisions are shaped. The health of these forums directly affects the
health of our democracies.[4]

10.Striking the right balance between combatting misinformation and
disinformation and protecting free expression is an ongoing challenge. The
importance of ensuring that efforts to prevent misinformation and
disinformation are placed within a broader human rights framework was
highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the
right to freedom of opinion and expression (Special Rapporteur) in their 2021
[report on disinformation and freedom of opinion and expression:](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G21/085/64/PDF/G2108564.pdf?OpenElement)

In a report devoted to disinformation, it is easy – but dangerous – to lose
sight of the value that digital technology offers to democracy, sustainable
development and human rights, or the vital importance of the right to
freedom of opinion and expression in that equation. That is why attempts to
combat disinformation by undermining human rights are short-sighted and
counterproductive. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is not
part of the problem, it is the objective and the means for combating
disinformation.[5]

## 3 The Right to Freedom of Expression

11.The right to freedom of expression is recognised as a fundamental human
right and has been described as constituting ‘the foundation stone for every
free and democratic society’.[6] It is enshrined in a range of international and


-----

Australian Human Rights Commission
**Finding balance: combatting misinformation and disinformation without threatening free**
**expression, 18 August 2023**

regional human rights instruments, including Article 19 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 19 of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).[7]

12.The right to freedom of expression is not absolute, and its exercise ‘carries
with it special duties and responsibilities’. The right may be subject to certain
restrictions, however any restrictions must be provided for by law and may
only be imposed for one of the grounds set out in Article 19(3) of the ICCPR;
namely ‘for respect of the rights or reputations of others’ or ‘for the
protection of national security or of public order or of public health or
morals’.[8]

13.Any such restrictions must also meet strict tests of necessity and
proportionality. This requires that any proposed restriction pursues a
legitimate aim, is proportionate to that aim, and is no more restrictive than is
required for the achievement of that aim.[9]

14.In particular, the UN Human Rights Committee has highlighted that,

when a State party imposes restrictions on the exercise of freedom of
expression, these may not put in jeopardy the right itself. The Committee
recalls that the relation between right and restriction and between norm and
exception must not be reversed.[10]

15.With respect to standards on disinformation specifically, it has been stated
that ‘general prohibitions on the dissemination of information based on
vague and ambiguous ideas, including “false news” or “non-objective
information”, are incompatible with international standards for restrictions on
freedom of expression … and should be abolished’.[11]

## 4 The Exposure Draft Bill

16.The Exposure Draft Bill is designed ‘to provide the independent regulator, the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with powers to
combat online misinformation and disinformation’.[12] These powers are said
to be required due to the growing challenge of misinformation and
disinformation which ‘pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians,
as well as our democracy, society and economy’.[13]

17.Addressing the growing challenge of online misinformation and
disinformation is a legitimate legislative aim. Although this submission
expresses the view that the current Exposure Draft Bill does not strike the
right balance, it recognises that there is a need to prevent misinformation
and disinformation. The Commission would welcome the opportunity to
contribute to discussions on any future iterations of the Exposure Draft Bill.

18.The key question is whether the Exposure Draft Bill meets the requirements
of necessity and proportionality in order to be compatible with international
human rights standards for restrictions on freedom of expression.

19.The issues raised below all raise questions about whether the Exposure Draft
Bill in its current form meets these requirements and provides sufficient
protection for freedom of expression.

### 4.1 Defining misinformation and disinformation

20.Defining misinformation and disinformation is a well-recognised conceptual
challenge. For example, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression concluded in
2021 that ‘there is no universally accepted definition of disinformation’ and
stated:

… part of the problem lies in the impossibility of drawing clear lines between
fact and falsehood and between the absence and presence of intent to cause
harm. False information can be instrumentalized by actors with diametrically
opposite objectives. Truthful information can be labelled as ‘fake news’ and
delegitimized. Opinions, beliefs, uncertain knowledge and other forms of
expression like parody and satire do not easily fall into a binary analysis of
truth and falsity.[14]

21.The risk with any legislation of this type is that it requires clear and precise
definitions to ensure that it does not end up becoming either over-inclusive
or under-inclusive when applied. If the definitions are too broad or vague the
risk is that content that is not objectively ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’
may be restricted. On the other hand, if the definitions are not broad enough,
then they will not be effective in addressing the mischief that the legislation is
attempting to address.

22.The definitions of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ (under s 7(1) and 7(2))
and ‘harm’ and ‘excluded content for misinformation purposes’ (under s 2),
combine to create a definitional framework that is overly broad and vague.
This enhances the risk of subjective judgments being made about what
content constitutes misinformation or disinformation.

23.The Special Rapporteur has warned that in this context, ‘vague laws that
confer excessive discretion can lead to arbitrary decision making and are
incompatible with article 19(3) [of the ICCPR]’.[15]

24.The definitions under s 7(1) and 7(2) of the Exposure Draft Bill provide that
content will be considered misinformation or disinformation if it, inter alia, ‘…
contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive’.

**Finding balance: combatting misinformation and disinformation without threatening free**
**expression, 18 August 2023**

25.The term ‘information’ is not itself defined in the Exposure Draft Bill. It is not
necessarily clear whether ‘information’ is intended to be limited to factual
content, and thus distinguished from other forms of content such as opinion,
commentary, or creative content. Nor is it clear how this distinction will be
applied in practice, given the volume of online content that involves a
combination of both factual and other forms of content. It is also difficult to
understand how content will be characterised when information is
incomplete, more than one reasonable interpretation is open, or information
is accurate at one point in time but subsequently becomes inaccurate.

26.The definitions provided in the Exposure Draft Bill differ in various respects
from definitions of misinformation and disinformation provided in other
contexts, but without any explanation in the guidance materials as to why this
particular wording has been adopted. For example, the Australian Code of
Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation includes the additional
requirements that digital content be verifiably false or misleading or deceptive
and be ‘propagated amongst users of digital platforms via Inauthentic
Behaviours’ in order to be characterised as disinformation.[16] The definitions
adopted by the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce provide further
examples that are significantly more limited in scope, with only ‘false
information’ being characterised as misinformation or disinformation.[17]
Further clarification as to why particular definitions have been selected would
assist in evaluating the Exposure Draft Bill.

### 4.2 The harm threshold

27.Content will only be characterised as misinformation or disinformation if it is,
_inter alia, ‘reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm’.[18]_

28.The categories of ‘harm’ provided within the Exposure Draft Bill are
themselves extremely broad and not clearly defined. For example, it is not
clear how the definition of harm as including the ‘disruption of public order or
society in Australia’ accommodates the lawful exercise of the right to protest
and where that balance will be struck. Similarly, categories such as ‘harm to
the health of Australians’, ‘harm to the Australian environment’ and ‘economic
or financial harm to Australians, the Australian economy or a sector of the
Australian economy’ are each categories about which reasonable people may
legitimately have different perspectives and views. The definitions provided in
the Exposure Draft Bill do not make clear whether in assessing harm it is
intended that the perspective to be applied will be, for example, short-term or
long-term, majoritarian or proportional, objective or subjective.

Australian Human Rights Commission
**Finding balance: combatting misinformation and disinformation without threatening free**
**expression, 18 August 2023**

29.There is an attempt to lift the harm threshold by imposing a requirement of
not just harm, but serious harm. The effect of this is, however, uncertain given
that the Exposure Draft Bill does not define ‘serious harm’, despite this being
an essential element of the definition of both misinformation and
disinformation.

30.This attempt to raise the harm threshold is further counteracted by the
definitions providing that the provision of the content on the digital service
only has to be ‘reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm’. The
use of ‘reasonably likely’ and ‘contribute to’ both lower the threshold and
significantly expand the potential reach of these provisions.

31.Content does not have to actually cause or contribute to serious harm, but
simply be ‘reasonably likely to do so’. This creates particular uncertainty here,
given that the defined categories of ‘harm’ are themselves broadly defined
and involve categories which are contested areas of public discussion and
debate.

32.In addition, the extent to which the content in question must contribute to
the ‘serious harm’ before it is considered to be misinformation or
disinformation is not specified. No minimum level of contribution is stated,
which leaves open the possibility that even a minor or tangential contribution
will be sufficient.

33.The broad and imprecise way that these key terms have been defined in the
Exposure Draft Bill appears to establish an extremely low harm threshold,
and risks an overly-inclusive characterisation of content as being
misinformation or disinformation.

### 4.3 Excluded content for misinformation purposes

34.The Exposure Draft Bill defines ‘excluded content for misinformation
purposes’ (Excluded Content) in s 2. Excluded Content provides a limited
carveout and subsequent protection for certain content within the Exposure
Draft Bill. This definition risks being both too broad and too narrow with
respect to different elements.

35.An example of the definition being too narrow is the failure to provide for a
general exclusion for academic, artistic, or scientific content, or content that is
fair reporting or comment. The definition of Excluded Content includes some
content that would fall within a general exclusion of this nature (such as, for
example, ‘content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment,
parody or satire’) but overall the existing definition creates a narrower


-----

Australian Human Rights Commission
**Finding balance: combatting misinformation and disinformation without threatening free**
**expression, 18 August 2023**

exclusion framework than is found in other relevant legislation that restricts
expression.[19]

36.A second example of the Excluded Content definition being too narrow is the
way that the exclusion covering academic content is limited to content
produced by, or for, an accredited educational institution. This raises
questions about academic freedom, particularly in terms of whether both the
institutional and individual dimensions of academic freedom are
encompassed by the current definition. For example, it is not clear whether
content produced by an individual academic that criticised or challenged
content produced by the academic institution that employs them would be
considered Excluded Content. At the very least, this highlights uncertainty
around the scope of the phrase ‘produced by or for an educational
institution’.

37.The exclusion for accredited educational institutions also fails to extend to
content that is produced by research institutions, think-tanks or international
bodies or organisations that are not accredited educational institutions. For
example, it does not appear to include any of the United Nations bodies
within the scope of the existing exemptions. This highlights the
inconsistencies that inevitably arise when attempting to define
misinformation or disinformation with reference to the source of the content,
rather than its nature.

38.In contrast there are also examples of Excluded Content being too broad.
Excluded Content provides a degree of protection for any content that is
authorised by a Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government.
Therefore any government-authorised content cannot, by definition, be
misinformation or disinformation.

39.This fails to acknowledge the reality that misinformation and disinformation
can emanate from government. Indeed, government misinformation and
disinformation raises particular concerns given the enhanced legitimacy and
authority that many people attach to information received from official
government sources.

40.A further risk with this specific exclusion is that it privileges government
content, while failing to accord the same status to content authorised by
political opponents. The result is that government content cannot be
misinformation, but content made by political opponents might be. This is
especially concerning where such content is critical of the government. There
are obvious risks if the regulatory framework is perceived to be anything
other than impartial and apolitical.

### 4.4 Powers granted for content regulation

41.The Exposure Draft Bill encourages digital platform providers to develop
misinformation codes. These codes require providers to implement measures
to prevent, or respond, to misinformation or disinformation on their
platform. In addition, it provides the ACMA with oversight of these codes,
powers to ensure compliance, and the power to introduce misinformation
standards in certain circumstances.

42.While the Exposure Draft Bill is focused directly on the regulation of systems
and processes rather than content, in reality an assessment about the former
cannot be made without a view being formed about the latter. For this
reason, there is no avoiding the conclusion that the Exposure Draft Bill does
involve the ACMA, albeit indirectly, in content moderation.

43.In practice, the Exposure Draft Bill requires that both digital platform
providers and the ACMA prevent or respond to misinformation or
disinformation, which necessarily engages both in content moderation (to
varying degrees). For example, while the ACMA is not provided with the
power to directly regulate individual pieces of content, it is difficult to see how
it could exercise its power to issue a formal warning for non-compliance with
a registered misinformation code (under s 43), issue a remedial direction to
ensure compliance with a registered misinformation code (under s 44) or
determine misinformation standards (under Division 5) without itself making
content assessments and deciding whether individual pieces of content fall
within the legislative definitions of misinformation and disinformation. In
practice, the Exposure Draft ultimately gives ACMA powers to regulate digital
content, and to impose significant fines on digital platforms if it determines
that they are not doing enough to stop misinformation or disinformation.

44.A key assumption here is that misinformation or disinformation can be easily
identified, and that there is no room for legitimate differences in opinion as to
how content should be characterised. However, distinguishing truth from
falsehood is not always a simple or straightforward task.

[45.As the Commission noted in the recent submission to the Senate Select](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/legal/submission/foreign-interference-through-social-media)

Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media:

There are also dangers inherent in allowing any one body – be it government,
a government taskforce, or a social media platform – to become the sole
arbiter of ‘truth’. There is a real risk that efforts to combat online
misinformation and disinformation by foreign actors could be used to
legitimise attempts to restrict public debate, censor unpopular opinions and
enforce ideological conformity in Australia. All efforts to combat
misinformation and disinformation need to be accompanied by transparency

**Finding balance: combatting misinformation and disinformation without threatening free**
**expression, 18 August 2023**

and scrutiny safeguards to ensure that any limitations imposed upon freedom
of expression are no greater than absolutely necessary and are strictly
justified.[20]

## 5 A human-rights based approach to combatting misinformation and disinformation

46.In its current form, the Exposure Draft Bill runs the risk of disproportionately
burdening freedom of expression. It is critical for laws in this area to strike
the right balance between combatting misinformation and disinformation
and protecting freedom of expression. As the Commission observed in the
[recent submission to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Interference](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/legal/submission/foreign-interference-through-social-media)
through Social Media:[21]

While there is a clear need to combat misinformation and disinformation online,
there is also a risk that in doing so different perspectives and controversial
opinions may be targeted. While reasonable minds may differ on exactly where
the line should be drawn, if we fail to ensure robust safeguards for freedom of
expression online, then the very measures taken to combat misinformation and
disinformation could themselves risk undermining Australia’s democracy and
values.

47.Any law aimed at combatting misinformation and disinformation must be
framed around human rights, and include robust transparency and scrutiny
safeguards. It should also be recognised that a multi-faceted policy response
is required, with measures such as improving digital literacy and resilience
amongst the broader Australian community also having an important role to
play in designing an effective policy response to combat misinformation and
disinformation.
