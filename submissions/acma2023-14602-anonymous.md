COMBATTING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL 2023

The proposed new legislation would grant the Australian Communications and Media Authority
(ACMA) unprecedented unilateral control over the dissemination of information online; with steep
civil and criminal penalties for dissenters.

Freedom of speech and freedom of expression are important to me. We have seen censorship
employed aggressively in the last 3.5 years in relation to ‘covid19’ with dreadful results that have
disadvantaged and harmed many people. Further censorship by government bodies poses a threat
to our health and to our democracy. Censorship of dissenting opinions is the first step in
totalitarianism and I strongly oppose it. That the government would attempt to introduce such a bill
is a disgrace.

Misinformation and disinformation are a matter of opinion and belief. There is no ‘truth’ in science,
only working theories that can be disproved as knowledge advances. We have government advocate
and act on information claimed to be ‘true’ in relation to covid, only for it to be subsequently found
to be false. This is proven, for example, in the claim that the Covid vaccines guard against
transmission of the virus when Pfizer have now openly acknowledged to the European Parliament
that tests of the vaccine were NOT undertaken in relation to transmission and that it does not stop
transmission.

Essentially misinformation and disinformation will be anything that ACMA or the government
doesn’t like.

It involves complete disregard for internally accepted human rights around freedom of speech, and
our rights to privacy.

This is the sort of legislation that one would expect in a repressive, communist country. It is not
consistent in a democracy which relies on the free flow of ideas.

This Bill is a dangerous and inappropriate abrogation of a fundamental human right and needs to be
abandoned.
