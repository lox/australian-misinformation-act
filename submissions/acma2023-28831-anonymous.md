# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 – Feedback

Nobody should be given the power to determine what is truth, as what is truth is constantly
changing and to be able to determine what is the truth, there needs to be healthy debate!

It would be very dangerous for government to be able to decide what is truth, without any debate
from other perspectives. There is no such thing as absolute truth.

It is clear to me that the purpose of this bill is to silence anyone who disagrees with the
government’s ideas and agendas. That is not democracy, it is tyranny.

Governments cannot be trusted with deciding what is the truth. They are some of the biggest
peddlers of disinformation and misinformation around!

I do not support this bill, nor does anyone I know. It is outrageous that this bill has even been
proposed in a democracy.

On July 4 2023, a US court shot down the Biden Government's censorship of free speech as
unconstitutional and anti-democracy. This is exactly what should happen here as this bill is
unconstitutional, anti-democracy and un-Australian.

NO, NO, NO! Absolute insanity this bill is.
