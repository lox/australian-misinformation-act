I am writing to make known my vehement opposition to the legislation the Labor Government is attempting to establish to silence
free speech in Australia. Why is the Government the arbiter of what is “harm” to Australians? Australians are quite capable of
recognising what is truth and lies, misinformation and disinformation. Since when did we Australians need our Government
“protect” us from opinions with which they disagree? This is totalitarianism! Australians are quite capable of understanding the
information that is presented to them. Just because this information differs from the Government’s narrative doesn’t mean we
can’t make an intelligent and wise decision about it. If the Labor Federal Government is going to silence dissenting opinions then
it is no better than a communist regime! We live in a democracy and it is the right of every Australian to have freedom of speech.
This is why we are called a democracy. This is what the Federal Government should be championing - freedom of speech not
censoring Australians who express a difference of opinion to the Government’s narrative.
The recent history of the government attempting to define what is “misinformation” should cause grave concerns about this bill.
During the pandemic, the Australian public was told that Covid-19 vaccines would prevent people from getting and spreading the
virus. Those who questioned and disagreed with this and refused to be vaccinated lost their professions or were stripped of their
right to work. Haven’t we learnt any lessons from this debacle of Government overreach was the way people lost their jobs
because they did not receive the Covid vaccine. Not only did the vaccine not stop you from getting Covid, but not there are now
other grave concerns emerging about the effects of the vaccine on the heart and other health concerns are emerging.
There is no good understanding undergirding the Government’s desire to curb our freedom of speech and censor what is shared
on social media or in any other digital communication. . It is not the Government ‘s role to cancel people who express a
difference of opinion to the Government’s line of legislation. Such censorship has shown the State and Federal governments to be
in serious error and behaving in a way contrary to our Constitution.
Why would a Government be afraid of people expressing an opinion opposed to their proclamations? Only because they are
hungry for control over people which is not our democratic way of life here in Australia. No previous Australian Federal
Government so feared the opinions of their own people that they sought to silence them. Former Labor Prime Ministers would
condemn the Albanese Government for such suppression of free speech.
In agreement with all who support freedom of expression and who oppose this bill, I decree this bill must be thrown out!
