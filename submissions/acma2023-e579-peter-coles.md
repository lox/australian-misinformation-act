# Public Submission: The Communications Legislation
## Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Cth)

Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport,
Regional Development, Communications and the Arts regarding the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (Cth)

I oppose the passage of this bill for the following reasons:


**a)** This Bill will impose some of the most draconian controls on free speech in the Western


world.


**b)** It is an attack on freedom of speech that is inconsistent with Australia’s international human


rights obligations and is out of step with equivalent European laws. The Bill enables
government bureaucrats and big tech to silence and censor speech that goes far beyond
reasonable limitation.

c) The Bill will give government the power to silence religious and political speech that

contradicts prevailing ideologies and political messaging.

d) The Bill fails to include mechanisms to protect valid expression of opinion and belief or to

ensure that there are clear and defined limits on suppression of speech.

The Bill sets out a framework to restrict speech that is deemed to be ‘misinformation’ or

‘disinformation’ which is vaguely defined in the Bill as anything that ACMA determines is false,
misleading or deceptive. Digital platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, Google and Netflix will
be required by ACMA-regulated codes and standards to police and remove ‘misinformation’ and
‘disinformation’.

However, the detail in the Bill is inconsistent and somewhat hypocritical in that government
communications are exempted from the Bill as are comedy/entertainment programmes and
professional news content.

This Bill will encourage service providers to take internal disciplinary action such as removing posts
or suspending accounts where they deem posts have breached a code or standards. If the online
platforms don’t take such disciplinary actions, they face severe financial penalties imposed by ACMA.


-----

This will ensure that service providers are forced to take an extremely careful and conservative view
when considering posts and will inevitably err on the side of caution and thus cancel any right to
freedom of thought and speech that they deem in any way controversial. This will remove any
possibility of exercising the ‘contest of ideas’ that provides the cornerstone for the sharing of and
distilling concepts to come up with the best solutions.

My question is “Who holds the unequivocal, total, complete and unarguable definition of what is
true?” My answer is; absolute truth is found only in the Creator of all truth, not in the creation!
ACMA does not own the complete and only definition of what is truth and what is deemed
misinformation and disinformation. Sadly, history is littered with examples over and over again that
which was perceived to be true at one particular time has been later shown to be absolute folly. It is
perhaps the epitome of arrogance and pride to ascribe oneself to be the arbiter of all truth.

It is the purpose of civilised society to search out truth through shared wisdom and after considering
a wide variety of different opinions.

The passage of this Bill needs to be guided by the following International and Australian Human
Rights declarations:

**The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 19) states:**

_“Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedoms to hold_
_opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any_
_media and regardless of frontiers.”_

**The Australian Human Rights Commission declares:**

_“All efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation need to be accompanied by transparency_
_and scrutiny to ensure any limitations imposed on freedom of expression are no greater than_
_absolutely necessary and strictly justified.”_

Please carefully consider the intent of the legislation and make sure it does not breach or contradict
the democratically enshrined concepts of the Rights of the Freedom of Expression and Opinion.
