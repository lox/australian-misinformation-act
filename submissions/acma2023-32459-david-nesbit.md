Quite simply the people who drafted this bill and those who supported it should be ashamed that
they seek to diminish and potentially remove any and all free speech from the public domain.
Laws already exist to punish what is termed “hate speech” or speech designed to incite violence
against others - there is no further need to attack speech which simply is at odds with
government approved information. In fact government information whether it relates to the covid
pandemic, climate change or “the voice” has proven to be amongst the most unreliable of
sources. Those involved in these shenanigans disgust me. The government has no right
whatsoever to prevent debate in public fora. In fact the Government is not afraid of
**misinformation, they are afraid people will speak the truth. The attempts to inflict limitations**
on free speech as seen in places like North Korea can only lead to a poorer Australian society and
I for one will lobby and campaign as hard as I am able against this bill and the people who
contrive to control free speech in this country. Disgraceful.
