# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

 The above bill poses a threat to the 'freedom of expression', for all Australians. We do not need or want Governments, (Politicians and Bureaucratic agencies) telling us what we can or can't say online or anywhere else. This Bill is a huge overreach of Government into the lives of Australians. It
is all about control and appears to have a strong resemblance to
# Communism. I do not trust the government, politicians and bureaucrats, on deciding what is misinformation and disinformation, as it seems they are the biggest culprits of spreading misinformation and disinformation. Eg. Our Prime Minister, who on several occasions has stated that the 'Uluru Statement from the Heart', is a one page document. This is completely false and misleading. If our politicians/bureaucrats cannot speak the truth, why should they have any right to determine what is misinformation and disinformation? This is a destructive Bill, and should have no place in our democratic society.
