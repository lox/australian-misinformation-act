# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

This legislation is a piece of legislation worthy of communist China. It would make the government
the ONLY arbiters of truth, allowing no one or other body to have a differing opinion. It was
demonstrated during the pandemic how dangerous this was. No truly democratic country stifles free
speech. Democracy demands it.

George Washington: March 15, 1783
Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the acts of free

speech.

Benjamin Franklin, Letters of Silent Dogwood.
Reason and free enquiry are the only effectual agents against error.

Thomas Jefferson.
The question does not concern whether speech is conservative, moderate, liberal,

progressive or somewhere in between. What matters is that Americans, despite their views will not
be censored or suppressed by the government.

These quotes may all be by Americans, but they were wise and gifted individuals who knew the
greed and avarice of men would endure and tried to protect their country from exactly what this bill
endeavours to achieve. It must NOT happen.
