SUBMISSION AGAINST THE NEW POWERS TO COMBAT DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION

These proposed changes represent a sea change in the way public communication is regulated and is
likely to be a significant interference with freedom of expression that is unforeseeable and which is
not proscribed by law. I wholly disagree with the government using social media companies to
regulate free speech. It is dystopian in the extreme and is the very definition of fascism.

I am wholly opposed to giving new powers to the so-called “independent” ACMA. Its principle Julie
Inman is a WEF member, therefore cannot be considered independent, but in a private club of elites
and globalists. These political actors are corporate NPCs (Non-Playable Characters, ie: they are not
voted in and do not answer to the electorate; in a self-regulating body, there are no controls over
what they may do) who want to control citizens without any electoral mandate. This bill will allow
these unelected elites to control people without any recourse to the will of those people. This is
undemocratic.

The premise of the bill that misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to safety of people is
flawed in every sense. Misformation and disinformation are just other words for censorship. We are
not children and our speech should not be governed other than by the existing laws of defamation.
Free speech is fundamental to democracy.

The pandemic which was game-planned in advance at the WEF’s Event 201, several months before
the actual pandemic, is a case in point. Censorship online was rife when private citizens were
reporting on things that were counter to the government’s narrative. All of the major planks in the
government’s approach – lockdown, masking, “vaccination” with untested gene therapy products –
have all now been proven to be unnecessary, unscientific and ineffective and caused harm to many.
Eg. Rise in child suicide, 15% rise in all-cause mortality in Australia, disconnection and destruction of
families driven by a government-advertised intimidation and fear campaign dreamed up by nudge
units of behavioural psychologists.

It wasn’t citizen journalism or individuals’ opinions on social media that caused harm; these were the
things that saved lives and gave lifelines to people trapped by autocratic lockdown rules, now
proven to have done more harm than good. A case in point: the Melbourne lockdown, the world’s
longest, was done to facilitate the Melbourne Experiment conducted by Monash University. Can
there be anything more draconian and brutal as this?

The World Health Organisation and its principal sponsor – – are forecasting they will have

another pandemic, and I suspect this desire to “do more” to restrict opinions on social media is a


-----

part of their recommended strategy for “pandemic preparedness” to “do more” this time to further
limit the truth being available to people.

Giving power to an unelected body to “do more” to “monitor efforts” as the AMCA’s Ms Inman
Grant has stated is surely is cart blanche to do in Australia what the FBI and CIA were doing to
monitor social media and restrict accounts and recommend accounts be limited or taken down,
against the First Amendment of the US constitution. This is totalitarianism dressed with a fig leaf
that says “it’s for your safety”.

Free speech is the most important principle of a democracy. Remove it and you do not have a
democracy. Any move to limit free speech is a dark policy that belongs to a totalitarian state or
dictatorship.

I provide the following examples of the ways this new form of censorship will play out as already
exemplified but it will become worse because people will have no comeback:

a. A capture of a post on social media by Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC, which would

show a train carriage decorated in BRICS colours, but to Canadian audiences was blocked.

b. This is a horrifying trend as the globalist corporations try to limit the window of knowledge

about the world. Example of what is happening with Wikipedia – Helen Buyniski reported on
a small group of editors at Wikipedia smearing people on their profiles There is no recourse
– no way to fight back if censorship backs up the established narrative - and it caused the
suicide of one man who was reputationally assassinated by Wikipedia – one

company one narrative, people have no recourse.

c. Dangers in safety signal shown by data on excess mortality in Australia. Also Denmark,

Norway and the UK which all these governments have been silent about. This information
was tried to be silenced in social media, in the social media is the only place concern is being
expressed. Danish Dr Vibeke Manniche here presents a safety signal common to all counties
which became statistically observable in May 2021. https://youtu.be/RtkfPWddQtY at 7:10
Dr Manniche says “we haven’t really been allowed to discuss this excess mortality” . One
could not find a more serious example of the dangers of censorship – in which people are
dying but the information is being silenced.

d. An extremely disturbing incident in which a pregnant Melbourne woman was arrested and

carted off from her home by police after she posted on Facebook. Two years later, police
quietly drop the charges against the woman but make no apology for the heavy-handed
censorship reminiscent of the Stasi in East Germany – all in front of her young children.
