Submission. A Free and Open Society.

I wish to express my opposition and concerns regarding the proposed Parliamentary Bill to
supervise, censor and prosecute Social Media Publishers and Open Media Platforms.

The proposed Bill and associated measures would undermine and violate Australia’s historical
endorsement and support as a signatory to the United Nation’s Charter of Human Rights Article
19.

Our Nation has a historical record of recognising in law our Citizen’s Common Law Rights of free
speech, assembly and publishing. Online Publishers are the new “Market Square” and provide
the connection and a ‘rostrum’ for public access to information and the free discussion of ideas
and current events.

The Government’s proposed new Bill for oversight of various Main Stream Media Platforms will
directly stifle the ability for the dissemination and communication of information and website
material for discussion and debate, so that Australia’s citizens can participate and arrive at an
informed consensus to Social and Government policy.

The argument for the need to “Police and Censor” harmful and offensive material is already
regulated and prosecuted under Federal and State Criminal Law and does not require another
layer of unelected Bureaucratic supervision and enforcement.

The publication of ‘Hate’ speech and indecent material on social material platforms is a criminal
matter and already has the appropriate criminal statues necessary to supervise and prosecute.

I am sure the majority of Australian citizens hold their right to free speech and the circulation of
information in print a sovereign right and would oppose the implementation of a Bill which
would restrict and control their access to and the open and free publishing of opinion and
information online.

The imposition of this Bill will provide the opportunity to limit and control conversation and for
political intrusion into public and private speech.

“Once you start censoring, you’re on your way to dystopia and totalitarianism.” RFK Jr.

Yours sincerely,
