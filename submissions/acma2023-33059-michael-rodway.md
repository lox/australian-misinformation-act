It's a disgraceful state of affairs that a bill like this should even be proposed in Australia in the first place,
and that people are expected to make submissions to point out ethical problems that should be obvious
to any reasonable person already.

Such is the same with this ACMA bill and submission process.
Initially, I was going to point out the similarities between the bill and the roles of Joseph Goebbels and
Warner Nuamann of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. However, it has since
occurred to me that the National Socialists of 1930s Germany were motivated by a genuine belief (even
though insane and misguided) that their policies would improve society.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the current Australian Government. It seems their policies are
guided by greed, self-interest, and the willingness to serve and cover for foreign globalist interests.

It's pretty clear that this bill is intended to enable the government to censor information that              - while not
supporting the government's narrative or their controllers         - is still important for the public interest and
safety. There have been countless instances of information that was labeled as misinformation initially
but subsequently proven to be true.

An example of this is the article in The Australian newspaper

"Covid origin ‘looks like a bio-containment failure’"
[https://tinyurl.com/Australian-LabLeak](https://tinyurl.com/Australian-LabLeak)

More importantly, information about the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccination/gene therapies
was also censored, along with whistle-blowers.

The result of the bill being passed will be the covering up of information that the public has the right to
know. It will also result in the censorship of non-targeted information, as media organisations either will
not allow public comments or filter all comments through Al so as not to fall foul of the misinformation
laws.
The decline in dialogue between people who have to find ways around poorly implemented and
conservative Al algorithms will result in the decline of the human condition in general.

This submission is not a request to have the misinformation bill rejected or modified. My opinion of the
government is already at its lowest point, as I believe the government is composed of criminals, and it is
beneath me to go begging to criminals for anything.

Instead, I'm putting you all on notice!

While it is not within my power to stop the bill, it is within my power to ensure that your descendants
know who you are and what you did. Your grandchildren and great-grandchildren will know of you as
monsters, just as people today think of Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, etc.

Your descendants will not share your family name; there will be no Albaneses, Rowlands or the like in
future directories, as nobody will want to claim you.

How is that for Censorship?
