# Hello, I completely disagree with the above bill as it effectively stops freedom of speech. Who defines what is misinformation anyway? This bill would see the government define what truth is and give power to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and online platforms (META, YouTube) to enforce it. The government and mainstream media would be exempt from the rules of this bill. The Albanese Government would empower ACMA to stop the spread of what it deems as “misinformation” (false information) or “disinformation” (deliberately false information) if it has the potential to cause “serious harm.” Critics argue that the definition of harm is subjective and dependent on the judgment of anonymous bureaucrats. This bill essentially aims to enable tech companies to censor what the government perceives as problematic speech. The government would be the ultimate authority of truth and ideological conformity would be enforced in Australia. Please ditch this bill as it will cause havoc and it destroys what could be deemed the individual's right to protest or have views contrary to the government in power at the time. We are to lose our integrity and identity as a nation of free thinkers if this happens. It's like a propaganda bill.

 kind regards, Jen Harvey
