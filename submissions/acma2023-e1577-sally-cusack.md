# SUBMISSION

 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Sally Cusack
2 August 2023

I am extremely concerned by the threats to democracy that the current draft of the
_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation)_
_Bill 2023 (“the Bill”) poses to this country and I submit that it should be withdrawn._

## Who gets to define “false, misleading or deceptive”?

The terms “Misinformation” and “Disinformation” have entered our lexicon in only the last few
years with the advent of alternative information sources to mainstream media. With the
proliferation of information sources, the public can find and share content that has not been
thoroughly fact checked. While this can cause confusion, the government needs to be
cautioned away from suppressing information and encouraged to build trust with its populace
by facilitating open discussion on contentious and complicated issues.

Democracy is founded on the principles of free and open debate between society’s
stakeholders: the government, all sides of the political arena, the full spectrum of
independent and state owned media, academia, industry experts and of course the general
public.

Decisions about what is true and accurate cannot be made purely within government and
then dictated to the populace without a process of negotiation to hone our understanding of
all information sources. With free and frank discussion, we can arrive at a consensus of
understanding and collectively agree to it. Without this process, we find ourselves in a
dictatorship.

## Where are the real “safety” issues?

As with the so-called “Twitter files” in the US, a FOI request by Senator Alex Antic has
revealed that Australian government agencies have already been found to apply pressure
4000+ times for the suppression of content that disagreed with government policies.
Importantly, some of these policies have since been found to be based on information that

contradicts a Cochrane review of research. Information of this calibre deserved full and
frank review by all experts.[1]

If, instead, the government had engaged with all perspectives on these issues, we would not
be forced to comply with non-evidence based policies. I contend that policies formed in this
way, place a far greater risk to our safety as they are applied to all people with the full force
of government power to impose them, not just the few who happen to read non-evidence
based content from independent sources.

## Even inadvertent sharing of information that doesn’t align with government policy will be unlawful

A most worrying aspect of this legislation is that it includes penalties for the sharing of
“misinformation”, i.e., the unintentional sharing of information that the government doesn’t
agree with.

This will completely put an end to any of the open discussion required for democracy.

Democracy is already under serious threat in this country, with lobbyists lining the walls of
parliament house at a rate of more than two for every MP. Our Prime Minister’s diary is kept
secret. Global corporate influences have reached unprecedented levels in recent decades
with free trade agreements that give corporations carte blanche to extract income here
however they want. These same agreements enable foreign IT services and platforms to
collect and monitor data from the Australian public for their own gain. Our ability to
participate is restricted to just one main process - one election every 3 to 4 years, and the
occasional impotent opportunity to make one’s opinion known, such as this one.

## This legislation will require increased surveillance

However, as erosions to democracy have increased over recent decades, this Bill is very
much in keeping with continuing the trend of increased control, secrecy and centralisation of
power by governments.

Enabling “the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers” will necessitate
more surveillance, forcing us into an inhumane panopticon. While “ACMA will not have the
power to request specific content or posts be removed from digital platform services”, this
will not matter as the providers will be faced with stronger enforcement to have the
surveillance done for them.

## The need to restore democracy

The “safety” this Bill is seeking distorts the meaning held by individual citizens. Greater
surveillance and reduced personal privacy will not make me feel safer. Existing in a
panopticon does not engender a sense of safety.

Even engaging in this process gives me some apprehension about what this could mean for
my future safety. As respectful of the process as I’m being here, I am still sticking my head
above the parapet and marking myself for future government surveillance.

This is not what a citizen in open and free democracy should feel. Yet I am doing it because
I do not want to look back and tell my children that I did nothing at this crucial point in history.

The intention of democracy is to provide the environment where the will of the people is
freely expressed. This is not achievable in a surveillance state that dispenses with
fundamental human rights.

I remind the government of the UN General Assembly on Human Rights’ 2002 declaration of
these essential elements of democracy[2]:



_●_ _Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms_



_●_ _Freedom of association_



_●_ _Freedom of expression and opinion_



_●_ _Access to power and its exercise in accordance with the rule of law_



_●_ _The holding of periodic free and fair elections by universal suffrage and by secret_


_ballot as the expression of the will of the people_



_●_ _A pluralistic system of political parties and organizations_



_●_ _The separation of powers_



_●_ _The independence of the judiciary_



_●_ _Transparency and accountability in public administration_



_●_ _Free, independent and pluralistic media_


Democracy is indeed teetering on the edge of an abyss in Australia, and this legislation
would mark the final nail in the coffin.

Please withdraw this Bill as a matter of highest priority.
