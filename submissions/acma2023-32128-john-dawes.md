As a retired lawyer I find it astounding that any Australian government could have strayed

so far from the principles underpinning our constitutional democracy as to seriously

propose introducing a bill such as this.

Firstly, the bill is incompetently drafted - political direction quite obviously overrode the

principles of competent drafting. Definitions are left breathtakingly vague and uncertain,

which even the politically naive and legally ignorant might realise is guaranteed to

maximise the discretion of government in exercising power and to minimise the discretion

of the judiciary in appropriately holding that power in check.

As former NSW Supreme Court Chief Justice Spigelman stated in 2003, drawing on long

standing precedent:


_"If Parliament wishes to interfere where rights, liberties and expectations are affected, it_


_must do so with clarity. The clear statement principle is the critical way that the law of_


_statutory interpretation reflects and implements the principle of legality."_

In any common law country where the separation of powers is respected - shockingly, no

longer in Australia, as the last three years have clearly demonstrated - any legislation

which so patently offends this principle should be at very real risk of being substantially

read down by the Courts, to the point of being rendered effectively invalid. It likely would

have been in the past.

Secondly, the bill prospectively offends the freedom of political communication implied in

our Constitution (ACT Television v Cth; Nationwide News v Willis) as well as those civil

rights of the individual to which we as a country have subscribed through ratification and

adoption of international treaties, particularly the International Convention on Civil and

Political Rights. These offences will rightly form a strong part of the High Court legal

challenges which will most certainly follow enactment of this bill.

All this clearly indicates a government whose ruthless intent is to thwart civil rights such as

freedom of speech in pursuit of protecting and aggrandizing its own political interests and

those of the powerful special interests, domestic and global with which the ALP (and the

LNP) has long been embedded.

The timing of the bill is of course no accident, given the way the demands of those special

interests have been aggressively preferred these past three and a half years over

undeniable scientific evidence and established global public health practice guidelines, to

the appalling detriment of this country and its people, socially, economically and physically.

If passed, this bill will not only serve to assist government denial of accountability for such

outrageous past offences, it will help ensure that it or any future government can offend

again with impunity.

The government is of course fully aware that open public debate is the lifeblood of

government accountability. What better way to avoid that accountability than to thwart

public debate by effectively outlawing any statement of evidence and opinion with which

the government does not agree, simply by labeling it 'misinformation' or 'disinformation'?

Apparently it is for the government with all its mixed and compromised motives to cherry
pick the evidence, prefer the pronouncements of dubiously appointed 'fact checkers' and

industry affiliated and/or government funded 'experts' over the opinions of acclaimed

leading independent scientists, researchers and clinicians and to exclude the latter from

debate. Even if any statement is ever in fact misinformation or disinformation, what

business does the government have in effectively prohibiting it from being made? It has

none. The interests of the public are not served by politically motivated censorship. The

proper, democratic course for any supposedly democratic government, is to argue its case

in the public arena and to do so through any and all platforms, not just those owned and

controlled by its allies. This bill confirms again that this government fears the

consequences of doing so.

If it can silence voices of dissent by labeling that dissent 'misinformation' or 'disinformation'

and can prosecute any public platform which has allowed those voices to be heard, we

have no open public debate, no real government accountability and therefore no real

democracy.

If your partner in this proposed offence against constitutional democracy, the Qld

government subsequently passes its proposed complementary bill - it is no doubt waiting

to see if you get away with passing your bill before it proceeds - then those who dare to

utter such dissent can themselves be prosecuted as 'criminals'. Dissent will not only be

censored, it will be criminalised. Then all that will remain will be to congratulate the ALP

on its transformation from a democratic socialist party to an anti-democratic Marxist one.
