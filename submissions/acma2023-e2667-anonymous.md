Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

### My wife and I STRONGLY object to the bill and it's political trajectory.

There are many issues raised about this bill including, but not limited to

### - Who defines what is Misinformation and Disinformation, i.e., who is the arbiter of 'truth'?
 - Interestingly so called 'hate speech' is protected by the US 2nd amendment (as long as it does not incite violence)
â€” again, who defines hate?

### - Having an alternate view that you find 'hurts your feelings' is not hate or misinformation.
 - Tolerance is not acceptance, we may find your view offensive but will tolerate it, but that does not mean we will
affirm, celebrate, or endorse your view. We must be free to speak what we believe.

### - Australia is a founding member of the United Nations and an original signatory of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR). Articles 18 and 19 deal with freedom of expression, association, and religion. This bill is in
violation of these fundamental rights.

### 'If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.'

      - George Washington

A personal history:
Rather than just talk more about the bill, I will relate the real-life experiences of my Dad, who lived through Nazi
Germany in the 1930s and 1940s.

Both my mother-in-law and Dad both lived through Nazi (socialist) Germany under Hitler's Nazi regime.

### For context, Dad turned E in 1932 and the Nazi enabling act (formally: Law to Remedy the Distress of the People
and the Reich) was passed in 1933, ostensibly to protect the people. He did not talk about it a lot, but the suppression
### of dissent, books, and freedom in general were huge issues for Dad.

On the occasions we did discuss it when I was older, he showed me how intrinsically important freedom is to our
society. Yet, we seem to have forgotten history.

It is also worth noting that property takeover was a big part of the Nazi agenda. Jews and others lost their homes and
businesses. We have just seen this happen recently with Calvary Hospital in Canberra. Dad said people were too
scared to speak up and basically buried their heads in the sand as long as they were ok.

One of the justifications for book burning (which started in 1933, long before the war) was the idea of preventing
subversion of the Nazi ideals; in other words, Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation! To me, this is the key
reason this bill must be stopped.

The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive or as representing ideologies opposed to
Nazism. These included books written by Jewish, communist, socialist, anarchist, liberal, pacifist, and sexologist
authors among others. This included porn and genuinely bad things, which was part of the justification; but it also
included works by critical 'bourgeois' writers like the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler; and 'corrupting foreign
influences,' among them American author Ernest Hemingway.

Conclusion:
The big question is, how did the German people allow this all to happen?

Dad told me that people wanted 'safety' and 'security' at any cost, which ended up being death for many. Hitler
promised (and only partly delivered) jobs, hospitals, Volkswagen cars, and a promise of Lebensraum or living room,
hence the invasion of neighbouring nations, leading to World War II.

Most people gave up their freedoms blindly, with no understanding of the consequences.

Some recent laws here in Australia like Dan Andrews' omnibus bill and the Calvary Hospital takeover are
Hilter-esque! It is akin to the Nazi Enabling Act. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 is of this ilk as well.

We must vigorously oppose the dilution of our freedoms.

This is a big call, you might say.

Most have no idea what really happened when the national socialists (Nazis) got power This is the same strategy as

I strongly reject this proposal.
