Discussion promotes democracy.
Democracy promotes discussion.
All ideas need to be debatable, not censored.
Protect free speech.

Please do not bring in laws curtailing mis/dis information for the following reasons.

1. Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy any restrictions to this undermines democracy.
2. Democracy is founded on the right to free speech, regardless of whether or not you agree with
the other viewpoint. Censorship of any free speech is a loss of our human rights.

3. I want to know what other people think, even if it’s extreme and I disagree with their opinion.
This promotes discussion and discussion leads to a better educated and freer society. You
suggest that misinformation is ‘harmful’ but I contend that it is less harmful than censorship.

4. Curbing mis/dis information will not apply to mainstream media because they operate
internationally and their content is controlled by corporations. They are beyond the reach of
government, whether you recognise that fact or not. As an example, it is corporations that
advertise betting on TV. No one wants it (morally) but the corporations found a loophole (or a
payoff) and the corporations get their way. Mainstream media has and does use
misinformation.

5. It will only restrict the voice of the small operators, and they are the ones who do the callout
about things like corruption, because they are not owned by the corporations and therefore not
restricted by corporate ‘rules’ and corporate interests. This is vital for democracy and human
rights to survive. They help keep the others honest.

6. Where do you draw the line and who decides where the line is drawn? The drawing of any line
is dangerous and leads to control, corruption, opinion and power by vested interests, some of
which people don’t even know exists until a few brave and lone voices call it out. That avenue
of democracy will be lost with this proposal.

7. Targeting digital platforms and not mainstream corporations is undemocratic and a slide into
corporate rule.

8. People have the right to be their own ‘fact checkers’ or else you have the fox guarding the hen
house. Corporations not only control the statistics but also what is released on the news. Their
monopoly profits by supplying the ‘approved’ solutions whilst also being the ‘fact checkers’ and
controlling the narrative. Your legislation will extinguish all meaningful discussion and
opposition to anything other than the corporate voice.

9. You are overestimating the harm of mis/dis information and underestimating the harm of
censorship. As an example, we have always had people predicting aliens or the end of the
world. This minor inconvenience is worth the price to keep speech free and stay uncensored.

10. Galileo was imprisoned for saying the earth went around the sun. They restricted his right to
free speech and called it misinformation. Your proposal is a version of that except where the
church restricted Galileo, it’s the corporations or well-meaning but ill-advised politicians that
aim to restrict free speech if it doesn’t fit the current narrative.

11. Who decides what is mis/dis information? It will be outsourced to corporations who have their
own agenda, or AI that is programmed by corporations, or a government body that is easily
bought/influenced by corporations or any body that has the financial power to influence. You
cannot be blind to the real and potential corruption in politics/government and government
bodies both past and present, or naive about it being there in the future.

12. Any law can be seen for its positive effect but the real discussion needs to be about any possible
abuse or negative effect. Any change to free speech is a real threat to democracy and a definite
potential for corruption and abuse, so it needs to be judged from this viewpoint.

13. We used to laugh at the censorship rules of communist countries. Now we have sadly become
this. Can you not see how badly this could become the undoing of democracy.

14. [Please watch https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-19/leave-no-dark-corner/10264302](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-19/leave-no-dark-corner/10264302)
15. Government overreach should be curtailed, not freedom of speech. It is too high a price to pay.
16. Enough of the nanny state. Citizens need to take responsibility for their own lives and decisions
without handing it over to the government.

Your quote –

_“Mis and disinformation sows division within the community, undermines trust and can threaten_
_public health and safety._

should be disregarded as misinformation however I will defend your right to say it.

“Division” is healthy debate and questioning, not division.

“Trust” should always be questioned and never taken at face value.

Everything becomes a “threat to public health and safety” when laws prevent citizens for doing due
diligence themselves on information presented to them and researching it for themselves. It is not the
job of Governments to be the gatekeepers of information.

Your quote should read 
_“Mis and disinformation fosters discussion within the community, educates people about keeping a_
_healthy balance between trust and mistrust, and alerts people to question government and corporate_
_narratives in order to keep them accountable.”_

In summary, does this proposal do too much harm to democracy? – absolutely. Therefore free speech
must be protected above all, and not be curbed for any reason because all reasons are too high a price
to pay for our freedom. Everyone has the right to know what extreme and moderate, groups are
thinking. That is far less dangerous than losing free speech.

People also have the right to express their opinions without censorship, especially when it is not the
currently held societal viewpoint. Debate on all viewpoints is the way forward to a better society, not
‘one opinion fits all’.

It is unethical to appoint people to decide, for others, what is mis/disinformation.

Please be the person who speaks out to protect free speech. Please let that be your legacy.
