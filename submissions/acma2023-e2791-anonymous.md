Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

Freedom of speech is so important, if that was to be taken away from us, that would be horrible. It’s our right as
humans to have our say, to be acknowledged and not told what to do and what is truth and what is not. There is no
respect to take our our rights and to be told what to do, it is unjust.

What is information to one person may be “misinformation” to another. No one has a monopoly on truth. It is
impossible for a government body to be responsible for making these decisions. We are supposed to be a free nation.

Please reject this authoritarianism.
