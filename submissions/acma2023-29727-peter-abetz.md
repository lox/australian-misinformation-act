**INTRODUCTION**

When the printing press was invented, it allowed people such as Martin Luther to publish their
views relatively cheaply using pamphlets. His views were at odds with those of the Catholic
Church at the time, but by means of his pamphlets his views gained widespread acceptance,
much to the chagrin of those in authority.

There were calls at that time that before anything could be printed and published, it should
have to be checked by those in authority on the grounds that people could easily be misled
and that the authorities had a responsibility to keep the community from coming to harm by
the circulation of false ideas.  This led to laws which allowed authorities to even make it a
capital offence to being in possession of some of Martin Luther’s writings!

Thankfully, however, Western civilization embraced the concept of freedom of speech and
such laws were consigned to the dustbin of history.

But freedom of speech is not an absolute freedom. It must have boundaries. Defamation
laws emerged to provide protections from the misuse of the right to freedom of speech.
Likewise making threats of physical harm against a person is not permitted.

Digital platforms, like the printing press, are a disruptive technology, which has made it much
easier for people to communicate their ideas to a broad audience at minimal cost.

While it is agreed that there is potential for harm to come to society through the dissemination
of mis and disinformation via various digital platforms, this potential harm needs to be
weighed against the alternative harm that would be caused to society by placing new legal
limitations on freedom of speech.

If society is to go down the path of limiting freedom of speech on the grounds of ‘protecting
people from harm’ as is the intent of the _Communications Legislation Amendment_
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023, (the Bill) it will require society to_
appoint a person or body, who will have the authority to determine what is disinformation or
misinformation. Needless to say, any organisation or individual that is given the power to
determine what is misinformation or disinformation and to limit the dissemination of anything
it considers to be dis or misinformation, will be handed enormous power to shape society by
having the power to silence the voices of those who do not share their view of the world.

**DEFINITIONS OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION**

Section 7 of the Bill defines misinformation and disinformation as follows:

**Disinformation**

It is noted that Section 7(2)(e) is the clause that defines the difference between disinformation
and misinformation, namely that disinformation involves malicious intent – namely that the
**intent is to deceive another person. In other words, the writer/communicator deliberately**
provides information that they know to be false and are providing it all the same for the
specific purpose of seeking to deceive another person.


-----

It is accepted that platforms have an obligation to do their utmost to prevent the
dissemination of such deliberate deception (e.g. financial scams), that they have a
responsibility to establish methods for identifying them and whereby they can quickly remove
such posts automatically, as well as when the platform is made aware of the nature of a post
by a third party.

**Misinformation**

The Fact Sheet provided on the Departments website states that misinformation differs from
disinformation in that with misinformation there is no intent to deceive. In other words, the
person doing the posting genuinely believes that the information being posted is factually
correct and true.

Requiring a platform to have a system to prevent (or quickly remove) what ACMA considers
to be misinformation, will result in the person posting having cause to claim that their post
has been deleted or made ‘unavailable’ because those in authority want to hide the truth
contained in their post from the public.

The person posting, genuinely believes they are disseminating ‘truth’ to their fellow citizens,
but someone in authority can thwart their attempt to inform fellow citizens, because that
body has the power to declare this person’s understanding of truth to be ‘false or deceptive’
and likely to cause ‘serious harm’!

I note that The Fact Sheet disingenuously claims that ACMA will not have the power to request
_specific content or posts be removed from digital platform services. However,_ ACMA has the
power to impose massive penalties if it deems a platform’s system for controlling dis and
misinformation to be inadequate. ACMA clearly would assess a platform’s systems based on
whether that system is able to keep ‘misinformation’ off the platform. Thus a platform must
have a system that prevents posts appearing which ACMA considers to be mis or
disinformation. The platform may consider the posts to be true and not harmful, but if ACMA
has a different view, inevitably ACMA’s view will prevail. It would be a brave digital platform
that would defy ACMA’s views as they would risk massive fines.  Thus, the Bill in effect sets
up ACMA to be the arbiter of truth.

Giving ACMA (or any other body) this power will only serve to erode confidence in government
and in public servants and create a situation where the free interchange of ideas and
information is no longer possible, unless the platform deems the information to be correct in
the view of ACMA.

The Bill ultimately makes ACMA the arbiter of what is “false, misleading or deceptive, (Section
7(1)a) and the arbiter as to what is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm
(Section 7(1)(d).

**The best way to combat misinformation is to allow open and free debate, not censorship of**
**ideas that someone subjectively considers likely to cause or contribute to serious harm.**


-----

I provide several examples below to highlight this:

**COVID 19**

I witnessed how Facebook blocked/deleted posts in the early months of the pandemic which
claimed that the virus had escaped from the Wuhan laboratory. This was because the health
authorities claimed that this narrative was not credible and had the potential to cause ‘harm’
in the community, and perhaps adversely impact our relationship with China. Yet as a result
of a current US Congressional inquiry, which subpoenaed the emails of various bureaucrats, it
now emerges that they were well aware at the beginning of the pandemic, that there was
very strong evidence that the pandemic was caused by a virus which had undergone ‘gain of
function’ manipulation in the Wuhan laboratory, and that this was the most likely origin of the
virus (see front page of The Australian 29-30 July 2023).  Facebook blocked the posts at the
time because Government sources wanted to suppress that view, as it did not align with the
messaging our health authorities felt was best for the community, and so it was deemed to be
‘harmful’ for this view to get traction in the broader community.

The emergence of this information only serves to further undermine confidence and trust in
our health authorities and government in general.

Had the provisions of the Bill been in force at the time, a platform whose systems did not block
or censure such posts, and which refused to accept a directive from ACMA to adjust their
system to block these posts, would have exposed itself to potentially massive fines. From a
commercial risk perspective, a platform would simply capitulate to the demands of ACMA.
Thus ACMA would take on the mantle of being the final arbiter of truth on digital platforms.

**VOTE COUNTING AT THE LAST ELECTION**

After the last election some of the volunteers of the so called ‘Freedom Parties” were claiming
that there was widespread fraud in the vote counting at polling booths. The basis of their
claim was that at the polling booths only the two-party preferred vote was being determined,
and so there was no count of the primary vote of the minor parties.  And furthermore, that
there was no distribution of preferences.  These posts clearly were casting doubt on the
integrity of our voting system, and thus falls under definition of harm used in the bill, namely:

(c) harm to the integrity of Australian democratic processes or of
_Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government institutions._

As a former MP I engaged with these ill-informed people on social media and went to
considerable length to explain to them (by repeatedly commenting on their ‘false’ posts) how
the vote count is done and why – that preferences can only be distributed at the central
counting place when all ballot papers from an electorate have been pooled.  It took some
backwards and forwards on social media before most of them accepted that what had
occurred at the polling booths was in keeping with proper procedure.


-----

Had Facebook blocked or deleted their posts, it would only have confirmed to these illinformed people that the authorities were corrupt, colluding with the tech giants to keep the
truth from the public. That would have caused far more harm than allowing these mistaken
people to express their views.

I cite the above two examples to highlight that in a free and open society, truth ultimately
wins through.

**TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH GENDER DYSPHORIA**

Relying on so called ‘fact checkers’ is fraught with danger too.  When gender clinics began to
use puberty blockers to treat children with gender dysphoria, claiming on their websites that
the effects of these puberty blockers were completely reversible, some medical doctors
objected, saying this was untrue, and that they had permanent, long-lasting side effects.

However, the big gender clinics, such as Tavistock in the UK and the Royal Children’s Hospital
(Melbourne) repudiated these claims.  Those who were sounding the warnings, were said to
be causing harm to gender dysphoric children, by sowing seeds of doubt into the minds of
parents of these children.

Now it is well established that the effect of puberty blockers is not reversible, and that they
have long lasting detrimental side effects.  Allowing free and open debate has resulted in the
truth eventually winning out.

Had the provisions of this Bill been in force a few years ago, the claim that puberty blockers
were not reversible, would have been deemed “false, misleading or deceptive, (Section 7(1)a)
and that, according to the gender clinics, was reasonably likely to cause or contribute to
**_serious harm._**

**It would have been a brave executive at a digital platform to resist any push from ACMA to**
**adjust their systems to block the posts warning of the detrimental impact of the puberty**
**blockers.**

Fact-checking bodies, basing their views on those espoused by leading gender clinics around
the world, assured us that the claims of the alarmists were false…..but now it is almost
universally accepted that they were on the right track.

Indeed, if authorities could have shut down the views that are not those of the prevailing
authorities, we would all still believe that the earth is flat!


-----

**CONCLUSION**

There is good reason for digital platforms to have a legal obligation to take down scams and
similar posts that are **deliberately designed to mislead by providing information that the**
posting person knows to be false and misleading. This aspect of the legislation is supported.

However, the attempt by the Bill to limit the right of persons to give expression on digital
platforms to views or facts that they genuinely belief to be true, is a serious attack on freedom
of speech, and should be rejected.

**The provisions of the Bill to control ‘misinformation’ will stifle free and open debate, and**
**effectively ensure that certain deviations from the narrative that a government wants to**
**maintain, cannot be challenged on the spurious claims of protecting society from ‘serious**
**harm’.**

**The** **best remedy to misinformation is free and open debate.**
