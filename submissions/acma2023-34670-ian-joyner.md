## Communications Legislation Amendment

 (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

This Bill is very concerning. The freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that
underpins all free societies, and it's important in this digital age of social media that we stay
vigilant to protect this freedom.

**_In_** **_a_** **_democracy,_** **_freedom_** **_of_** **_expression_** **_is_** **_vital._**

The Bill gives a great deal of power to ACMA to force digital platforms to police 'so called'
misinformation. Misinformation and disinformation are too often used as an excuse to shut
down criticism and dissenting opinion online and there have been many things once labelled as
misinformation that have turned out to be true.

_John_ _Stuart_ _Mill_ _once_ _said:_ **_"All_** **_silencing_** **_of_** **_discussion_** **_is_** **_an_** **_assumption_** **_of_** **_infallibility."_**

Trying to impose big brother type censorship is the sort of thing governments do when they
want to stop the truth from getting out. Giving ACMA the power to force foreign companies to
censor free speech is simply a recipe for disaster. The past few years have shown us that many
things declared as "fake news" one day end up being proven truthful several months down the
track.

Scientific progress relies on the ability to refute the consensus.

The best way to counter misinformation is through respectful debate and history has shown
that the censorship of speech has always been the beginning of authoritarianism.

### What is "Misinformation7?

Terms like 'misinformation', 'disinformation', 'fake news' and 'hate speech' are frequently used
by critics, regulators, bureaucrats and political actors to smear ideas they don't like, and to
restrict people's freedom to express those ideas. Very often, the use of such terms betrays more
about the people wielding them than the speech they wish to prohibit.

**_A_** **_concept_** **_like_** **_'misinformation'_** **_is_** **_unavoidably_** **_subjective._** What one person regards as
'misinformation', another may deem to be a perfectly moral viewpoint, a fact of nature, or a

self-evident proposition. On countless subjects, even the line between what is fact and what is
opinion is hotly debated.

Moreover, what society regards as 'misinformation' at one point in time can, within just the

space of a few years, be embraced as as true — or vice versa.

Thus we are faced with a most consequential question — namely, **_who_** **_gets_** **_to_** **_decide_** **_what_** **_is_**

**_true_** **_versus_** **_what_** **_is_** **_'misinformation'?_** The political party that forms government? The majority
of citizens? CEOs of media conglomerates? Intergovernmental bodies like the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the World Health Organisation or the World
Economic Forum?

Moreover, who informs Australians when certain ideas — new or old — cross the subjective
threshold from true to mere matter of opinion to 'misinformation'?

The Australian Greens have a policy in which they explicitly state that, "Regulation of the
internet is to be transparent, accountable and protective of privacy, freedom of speech and

access to information." What do they mean by transparent?        - That we won't know what is
censored, or that there'll be free speech? I doubt they mean the latter!

**_Government_** **_censorship_** **_of_** **_expression_** **_of_** **_ideas_** **_is_** **_always_** **_sneaky,_** **_and_** **_controlling-_** **_no_** **_matter_** **_to_**

**_whom_** **_they_** **_may_** **_delegate_** **_the_** **_responsibility!_**

Without answers to these questions, the Albanese Government is demanding that Australians

sign a blank cheque — to surrender their freedom of speech online to unknown, unseen and
undefined forces.

#### Australia's Commitment to Freedom of Speech

Freedom of speech is a fundamental right of every Australian.

Australia is a founding member of the United Nations and an original signatory of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Article 18 of that declaration reads:

Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right
includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in
community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in
teaching, practice, worship and observance.

Article 19 takes this right even further:

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom
to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and
ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

Australia's commitment to these inalienable, universally-agreed-upon human rights has not
been revoked. On its website, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that:

Australia's commitment to human rights is enduring: we were an original signatory to
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. We have been a leading proponent
of its consistent and comprehensive implementation.

In short, the passage of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 would put the Commonwealth of Australia in
breach of its international human rights obligations and at odds with its own nation's character
and values. This is a threshold Australia must not pass.

What the drafters of this bill fail to recognise is that human rights are non-negotiable. They do
not belong to any government, nor are they granted by government. To quote Benjamin
Franklin once more, "Freedom is not a gift bestowed upon us by other men, but a right that
belongs to us by the laws of God and nature."

Freedom of speech is the birthright of every Australian. It is the role of the Commonwealth of
Australia to recognise that fact and to protect the freedoms that every Australian already

possesses.

**_The_** **_impulse_** **_to_** **_decide_** **_which_** **_speech_** **_constitutes_** **_'misinformation'_** **_and_** **_must_** **_be_** **_censored_** **_is,_** **_at_**
**_heart,_** **_totalitarian._** By giving government agencies increased power over the words that
Australian citizens are allowed to utter, the Albanese Government tempts tyranny. In the wise
words of Thomas Jefferson, "a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong
enough to take everything you have."

##### In a free society debate should be met with debate, not stifled by government actions designed to silence Australian citizens through threatened legal action against media and internet service providers.

#### Conclusion:

To conclude, this draft bill anticipates a world in which the democratic ideals that built modern
Australia — such as freedom of speech and the freedom of the press — are replaced with
autocratic powers that weaponise the State against its citizens.

No one has all the information at their disposal. No one has a claim to infallibility. No one has a
monopoly on truth — including ACMA. And that is precisely why ACMA must not be given these
proposed powers.

Everyday people should not be censored for disagreeing with the State.

The Commonwealth must continue to be held accountable by its citizens.

Freedom of speech must be preserved at all costs.
