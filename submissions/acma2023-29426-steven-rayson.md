6[th] August 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to expressly say that I DO NOT CONSENT to the proposed Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 for the following reasons:

  - It is only applied to the general public and independent media

  - The bill is “open-ended” in that it grants undefined powers

  - Who decides what is misinformation & disinformation?? – the government has shown itself
to be incapable of this task

  - This proposed amendment reeks of a ‘big brother’ style of government – one I am totally
opposed to as the government should be getting out of our lives not trying to control them.
We are all sovereign and DO NOT require consent from anyone to do as we please on the
proviso that we do NOT harm others by our actions

I watched a video recently showing ‘news’ stations in the US with around 20 stations all reading from
the same script word for word about people spreading false and misleading information.

Looking at misinformation and disinformation when is the government – federal and state, health
departments – federal and state going to be investigated for the whole covid-19 debacle. There is a
massive amount of evidence that the government stated was false has now turned out to be
completely true and shown the government to be inept and should all be removed from office and
tried in a court of law for their actions by one way of an example would be the weekend Australian
front page last weekend (July 29-30) with the headline “Covid cover-up: how science was silenced”.

How many Medical professionals around the world have been smeared and discredited for saying
this exact same thing previously and yet it is now common knowledge????

I DO NOT CONSENT to this tyranny,

Steven
