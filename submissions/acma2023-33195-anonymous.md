I am afraid for the Australian people if this law passes parliament. If this law passes, it will be
the end of free speech, open debate and genuine online conversation in Australia.

Factual information changes over time, and the government can simply be incorrect about what
is factual.

Even META states that this law is dangerous for the Australian people and could be used to
silence free speech.

Governments that claim to be the sole voice of truth are authoritarian and totalitarian. The
government would control the media, restrict free speech, punish people for stating differing
views, even if they are objectively correct. This suppression of information is never a good thing
for any country.

Governments are always biased. Even if Labour is happy with the law, it will inevitably be used
against them.

Other countries that claim to be the sole voice of truth are Russia, China, and North Korea. Donâ€™t
let this happen to Australia.
