I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’.

The big question is how we can determine what counts as “misinformation”. What is information to one person may be
“misinformation” to another. No one has a monopoly on truth. It is impossible for a government body to be responsible for
making these decisions.

There are so many examples where a previously-accepted idea was found to be untrue, but only after much investigation and
debate. Free speech is needed for us to arrive at the truth.

The idea that people sitting in an office somewhere in Canberra hold all the wisdom on what’s true and what is “misinformation”
is absurd – and deeply dangerous. It’s the kind of move expected by a totalitarian government. We are supposed to be a free
nation.
When right is right and wrong is wrong. My conscience cannot be mistaken. Its fundamental to life. It’s putting a straight stick
down and laying another alongside it. Our eyes see any the difference right away if another is incorrect.
Reject this authoritarianism.
