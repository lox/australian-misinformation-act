**Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and**

**Disinformation) Bill 2023**

Official control of the narrative of online content by Government via ACMA is a very bad
thing.
This will stifle Freedom of Speech.

We have a right to collect information and decipher truth without Government interference
controlling what is deemed to be the truth.

It is an outrageous attack on free speech to allow ACMA to decide what online content
constitutes harm to the health of Australians and the Environment and to enforce the silencing
of other opinions.

With threats of huge fines, online tech companies will censor anything that does not confirm
the Government narrative of what is truth.

Government control, via ACMA, over what information is allowed, is more of a threat to the
safety and wellbeing of Australians and our democracy, society and economy than allowing
online differing opinions to the Governmental narrative.
Why are your own Government and media exempted from being subject to this
misinformation and disinformation?
This shouts of control with no accountability and has always been used by authoritarian
regimes throughout history.

To control online information communicates the message that Government is afraid of the
truth and peopleâ€™s right to search out the truth.

The best way to combat misinformation is always free and open debate, NOT censorship!
