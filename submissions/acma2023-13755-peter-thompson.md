# New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

 STATEMENT:

I wish to state my objection to intended legislation of this type that will restrict free speech.
History proves that attempts to restrict speech leads to those in power using legislation of this type
for their own benefit which is sinister.
We do not need politicians and bureaucrats controlling free speech.

“If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”
_George Orwell._

Typical strategy:

1. Identify an inconvenient dissent.
2. Label it misinformation.
3. Find a few experts to say so… they need not use data to back it up.
4. Use media to amplify expert claims.
5. Say science is settled, use labels for dissenters.
