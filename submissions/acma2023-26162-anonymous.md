# Regarding the Government proposal to grant ACMA broad powers to develop and enforce a Code of Practice covering measures to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms I am submitting my absolute disapproval and unacceptance of this proposed bill.

 The public is being led to believe that their safety is being threatened by a continuous plethora of events and now it seems that misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms is so much of a threat they need Government to intervene to protect them.

 Who decides what is misinformation and disinformation and how do “they” conclude that what is being said is deceitful, hateful or harmful and why do “they” believe our safety is at risk? The ‘Fact Sheet’ has no information regarding who is checking the checker and what external oversights are in place.

 Is it too much a stretch of the imagination to think that Australians can determine truth for themselves, based on knowledge they have gained, careful thought, logic and life experience.

 By and large the public are turning away from mainstream media, well aware of the mistruths they propagate and therefore have every right to seek answers on any subject from whatever source they choose without Government overreach. The public are discerning and do have the right to hold an opinion without interference.

 I also must wonder why ‘professional’ news outlets, Government accredited educational bodies and the Government themselves are excluded from these rules. Why are they deemed the arbiter or truth?

 I am greatly concerned to be heading down this path. Free speech is fundamental to our democracy, discourse and debate should be cherished; we should never accept any less.
