Submission regarding Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023.

I am gravely concerned about the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023.

I believe that freedom of speech is an essential part of a free and fair society. It is a value we have
held onto in this country of Australia. But surely, this bill is so designed that it threatens this
fundamental human right.

If we are to remain a free society that looks at all sides of the coin to discover what is true, then
freedom of speech on every platform needs to remain. All information should be available for testing
and questioning. Without adequate and open dialogue, we open ourselves to grave error.

In this day and age, the internet is used extensively as a platform for debate. Of course as well as
facts, false information can be sent to the world in an instant. However, who is to say what should
and should not be said?Who is the appointed person to make such decisions and how can we know
they are going to make the right decisions? Each person has a right to discern for themselves what
information is true and not true by their own investigation, not one or a group of persons the
government appoints.

I am seriously worried that this proposed bill would compromise our free society. Please oppose this
bill.
