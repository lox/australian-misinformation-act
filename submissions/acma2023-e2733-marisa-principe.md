# New ACMA Powers to Combat


# Misinformation and Disinformation


To Whom It May Concern.

I wish to express my concerns with the new bill that is intended to be passed to combat
misinformation and disinformation.

I have grave concerns as to who will be deciding what is misinformation and disinformation.

I consider myself a well-balanced person who wishes to research and make choices based on
information that fits in with my personal circumstances and belief system. It is imperative that as an
Australian I have the ability to choose what I read and do not wish for anyone but myself to make
these decisions. I have always believed that as a human being, we should have choices, we should be
able to make our own decisions, the understanding that our choice will have an outcome, positive or
negative. I have brought up my family, teaching my children this, which in turn has made them
balance, caring adults, all of them contributing positively to society.

Australia is supposed to be a democratic country. I feel that our democracy will be greatly
diminished and is at considerable risk. It will contribute to the dumbing down of education, not only
on an academic level, but on the experience of learning to decipher ones truth from another. This
will affect younger adults’ ability to think for themselves and become “street smart” in life. It will
diminish constructive completion and debating of information, especially in the medical field. Giving
ACMA the power to silence information that you think is misinformation and disinformation is very
un-Australian. We are a nation of very intelligent and educated people and I don’t think you have
the right to think any other.

If this bill is passed, I feel that we are heading into a Communist style leadership in this country,
where only one sided information is constantly delivered. This would be truly detrimental in a free
and democratic society and will significantly impact the rights and liberties of every person.

Thank you for the opportunity of being able to contribute my view in regards to this bill.

Regards.

Marisa
