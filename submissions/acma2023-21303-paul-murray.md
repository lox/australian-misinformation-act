To whom it may concern

Re: the new ACMA misinformation / disinformation (read: censorship) act

While everyone might feel it important to be “protected” from harmful societal influences, this
proposed legislation is nothing less than the woke nanny state on steroids.
On one side of the world, a conscientious billionaire sees true harmful informational practices at
work when a handful of people provably linked to governmental intelligence agencies, subvert
factuality and truth through stealth and deception – this in the interests of (not protecting the
welfare of citizens but) protecting the narrative that these colluding, collaborative actors while any
other opinions which may dissent against that narrative, are summarily shut down.
And this is done without the informed consent of the people.
The Twitter files exposed this in all its egregious and insidious reality. Certain “approved” narratives
were promoted while other narratives, regardless of their validity, were either marginalised,
censored to some degree or just plain deplatformed altogether.

This Australian legislation seeks to do exactly the same thing. It is outrageous.
The citizens of this country have the capacity and the right, as is enshrined in any free democracy, to
access all information and opinion regardless of its source and content without this being filtered
through the cogs and mesh of a supposedly authoritative group, no matter how well intentioned.
Only open access to information provides the very base tenet of informed consent. Something that
was patently absent through the covid pandemic when inalienable rights to bodily autonomy were
subversively removed through orders and as a result, experimental procedures were forced on
people without the benefit of informed consent.
I oppose this proposed bill with every fibre of my being - if it walks like fascism, talks like fascism and
removes in any shape, manner or form, the right to choice (as this unarguably will do) then it IS
fascism.
No.
Hell, no.
Not ever.

Sincerely

Paul Murray
