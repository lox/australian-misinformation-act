# Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

I have read through the proposed Bill and while the outcomes are well inten�oned, I am
concerned about the Bill’s poten�al inadvertent nega�ve impacts that it could have on
Australians.

There are three key aspects in the Bill that I believe are far too generalised:

  - The use of words ‘false, misleading or decep�ve’ within the defini�ons of
misinforma�on and disinforma�on;

  - The phrase within sec�ons 7 (1)(d) and 7 (2)(d) ‘reasonably likely to cause or contribute
to serious harm’;

  - The defini�on of ‘harm’.

I believe these could be weaponised by complainants, ACMA or other authori�es to silence
opposing or unpopular opinions or informa�on/content, due to jus�fica�on by interpreta�on.

My first point raises concerns on those three words within the defini�on of misinforma�on
and disinforma�on. There are no clauses outlining the factors with which something is
determined to be ‘false’, ‘misleading’, or ‘decep�ve’. Thus, open for interpreta�on depending
on perspec�ve. To be able to enforce anything based on those defini�ons, there must be a
framework on how to determine when something is clearly false, misleading or decep�ve.

Addi�onally, the phrase ‘reasonably likely to cause or contribute to’ is very open ended. What
is the extent that something is considered to have contributed to serious harm? Would a
digital pla�orm service that says ‘we recommend doing this’ with a disclaimer that it’s not for
everyone be considered to have reasonably likely contributed to serious harm? The clauses
need to be refined so there is far less room for interpreta�on.

The defini�on of ‘Harm’ is also far too open to interpreta�on. For example: Harm to the
integrity of Australian democra�c processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local
government ins�tu�ons. Could consistent content, that might s�ll be factual but causes
distrust in Government over the short or long term, be considered Harm? The provision or
sharing of reasons why people should distrust the Government might be jus�fied at the �me.
A contextual example could be if the Government uses its power to go against the majority of

the Australian people’s preferences for something that has huge nega�ve impacts on
everyone, such as war or using taxpayer money to facilitate war.

Harm to the health of Australians is also far too generic. Another example: There are several
diets being promoted online. Since everyone is different, there will be diets that benefit one
person’s health but would be detrimental to others. Eg. High carb diet might benefit an athlete
whereas be detrimental to someone with diabetes. Does this mean a diet that is not
universally known would be considered as Harming the health of Australians?

There are many more examples of interpreta�ons in these defini�ons that can be trivial but
under this Bill could s�ll be enforced with penal�es issued which is why I’m concerned.

These sec�ons noted in my dot points (if they remain defined and enforced as they currently
are) will prevent debate and discussion on numerous topics that don’t have unanimous
consensus, as digital pla�orm services will just self-censor to avoid the poten�al of being
penalised.

I believe free speech, debate and discussion on all topics is necessary for everyone to be
exposed to differing perspec�ves, and poten�ally learn from each other while promo�ng
growth in our ways of thinking.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide this submission.

Kind Regards,

Sco� Fixter
