I oppose the so called _Combating_ _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation_ _Bill_ as proposed by the Albanese Government.
The Western Liberal Democratic system evident in Australia has delivered prosperity, security, well-being and
freedoms unimaginable to the vast majority of humanity, present and past. It is a system that is very precious and
extremely fragile.
Free speech is a key pillar that underpins our liberal democratic system. It is a fundamental right, because without it
we cannot assert our other rights. Without it, we cannot hold governments to account. Without it, we cannot fight to
uncover the truth. Without it, we cannot voice and debate ideas. With out it our Liberal Democratic system will not
survive.
A healthy, functioning democracy requires freedom of speech, which means that ideas from across the ideological
and political spectrum are discussed and debated with the hope that good arguments, guided by the light of truth, will
win the day. However, words like harm, misinformation, and disinformation have been weaponised to shut down
critics of the broader ideological agenda at work in western nations.
Therefore, I have serious concerns and oppose the so called _Combating_ _Misinformation_ _and_ _Disinformation_ _Bill_ as
proposed by the Albanese Government as the proposed new powers will threaten freedom of speech and democratic
rights in Australia in the following ways:

### • The Bill grants the government the authority to define truth, allowing them to control and manipulate the flow of
information.

### • Whilst imposing restrictions on online platforms, the Bill gives the government and mainstream media a free
pass, creating a double standard and eroding the principles of fairness and equality.

### • The Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to determine what qualifies as
“misinformation” or “disinformation”. This subjective definition leaves room for abuse of power, and suppresses
public debate and diverse opinions and perspectives.

### • The Bill effectively enables tech companies to become tools of government censorship, stifling free speech and
undermining the open exchange of ideas.

### • The Bill paves the way for ideological conformity, suppressing dissenting voices and hindering independent
thought. This goes against the principles of a democratic society that thrives on diversity and freedom of
expression.

I urge the government to withdraw this Bill and uphold the fundamental rights of every Australian citizen as stated in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights     - _“Everyone_ _has_ _the_ _right_ _to_ _freedom_ _of_ _opinion_ _and_ _expression;_ _this_ _right_
_includes_ _freedom_ _to_ _hold_ _opinions_ _without_ _interference_ _and_ _to_ _seek,_ _receive_ _and_ _impart_ _information_ _and_ _ideas_ _through_
_any_ _media_ _and_ _regardless_ _of_ _frontiers.”_

Anything less will cause serious, detrimental, implications for free speech and democracy in Australia. I urge the
Australian government to uphold the principles of transparency and accountability, and foster an environment where
open debate and diverse opinions are welcome. To do anything less will see Australia travel further down the path of
authoritarianism and destroy the precious and unique system of Western Liberal Democracy that has delivered
prosperity, security, well-being and freedoms unimaginable to the vast majority of humanity, present and past.
