# I am against providing the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with new powers to combat online misinformation and disinformation.

The bedrock of a strong democratic nation like Australia is the basic freedom of individual citizens or
organisations to think, investigate and share information. The new powers for ACMA to combat
online “misinformation” or “disinformation” would stifle that freedom.

The elephant in the room is exactly who will make the decision on what constitutes a
“misinformation” or “disinformation”?  To decide “truth” is to skew the people towards the agendas
of those deciding “truth”. To allow a particular agency or individuals to decide truth will be going the
way of autocratic regimes in the past (for example Nazi Germany) with catastrophic results for the
real truth.

The government may argue that the general public has limited capacity to decide what is “truth”. If
one goes with that argument, then the government is saying that their intelligence and judgement is
above that of the people who elected them. What an irony!

Therefore, it is in my opinion that the best way to combat “misinformation” and “disinformation” is
to continue to allow the basic freedom of individual citizens or organisations to think, investigate and
share information. In this manner, all information will be subjected to the debate and judgement of
all the good people of Australia and the “truth” shall prevail.
