Dear Officer,

**_New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation (the_**

**_Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and_**

**_Disinformation) Bill 2023_**

1. I wish to thank the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,

Communications and the Arts (the Department) have inviting feedback on the

exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (the Bill).

2. In preparing this submission, I read the one that Children's Health Defense - Australia

Chapter (as published on their website) lodged with the Department.

I consider that it is the product of conscientious research and deliberation deserving of your

attention. According to their website, it was principally the work of a human rights lawyer

who wrote it on their behalf. Its arguments are sound and conclusions, good. Therefore, I

stand behind their submission, and urge those charged with its review to give it due

consideration.

3. The Founding Fathers of the United States of America were very well educated, intelligent,

and astute men. From my (lifelong) learning, I understand that they struggled with the issue

of free speech when drafting the First Amendment to their Constitution. Having successfully

won their independence from England, they were determined to make the New World the

land of the free. Cognizant of the history of Europe, they concluded that that could only be

achieved by strictly limiting the power of the government. In their minds, a legitimate

government was one that obtained the consent of the governed, and any attempt to stifle

debate by its constituents was ceding more power than necessary. Any censorship would

cause more harm to those citizens and their liberty, than any caused by the dissemination of

misinformation or disinformation, whatever that may be.

Accordingly, if Australia is to remain a democratic nation, I reject the need for such

amendments as the Bill proposes, and call for this Bill to be dropped altogether.

4. With respect to the draft Bill, I note that, apart from the freedom of expression issue, you

are seeking people’s views on whether it strikes an appropriate balance on a range of other

issues, i.e.

- the complexity of content exemptions

- the scope of the private message exemption

- the size of the penalties and any other issues.

My argument in (3.) negates the need for me to address these matters.

5. The perceived need for this Bill seems to be prompted by the media (all types) coverage of

the COVID pandemic. This is suggested by Fact Sheet 1: key research findings.

In summary, it attaches much weight the idea that the dissemination of misinformation and/or

disinformation during the pandemic was done by ‘conspiracy theorists.’ This is ad hominem

pure and simple, and a prime example of a logical fallacy; this provides no proof whatsoever.

Fact Sheet 1 should be assigned to the dust bin.

6. History tells me that we have been down this road before; it was only last century. It led to

horrific consequences and the deaths of many millions of people. Drop this bill now!
