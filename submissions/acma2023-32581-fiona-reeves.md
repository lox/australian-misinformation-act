To the Committee,

I am a teacher in and I am very concerned about the

exposure draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

# Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

 Although the intention is to improve clarity and authenticity of information shared, the

 restrictions on the freedom of expression are a danger to the fundamental sharing of

 information necessary in a functioning democracy.

The exemptions likewise are well meant, but are so complex one can foresee High Court

challenges by those with money, and overreach by business owners and social media

# platform monitors on the citizens the Law should aim to empower.

Private messengers are already heavily censored, even without this Bill. Although an

# exemptions are mentioned, in practice this Bill will empower social media monitors/
 community guideline enforcers to feel virtuous by misusing their censorship powers.

The few provisions that have been included to acknowledge the competing right to freedom

# of expression are tokenistic and do not satisfy the high bar required in international law for

 the interference with fundamental rights of freedom of expression.

Yesterday's misinformation may be tomorrow's well-known fact; consider how the

existence of Jewish consecration camps was misinformation for years, but now in our history

# textbooks.

Rather than amend this Bill, it ought to be discarded as a threat to our democracy. It is better

# to allow the risk of lies than reduce and restrict our accessibility to dubious facts and truths.

I refer your committee to the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and use these to shape Australia's ability to increase

# communications and sharing of knowledge.

Yours faithfully,

Fiona Reeves Bach.HRSc, Masters of Teaching
