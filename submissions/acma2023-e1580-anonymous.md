This proposed “Bill” is a poorly considered and will, if intentional or not, ultimately damage the right of a person to express one's
opinion (on any given matter) through free speech which is a non-negotiable human right and thus must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. This is very subjective.
What one person perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It
is impossible for any government to police such subjectivity and stay neutral.

The Australian public are experiencing an increasing encroachment of restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past
several years especially in Social Media and other public arenas. This proposed bill is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
