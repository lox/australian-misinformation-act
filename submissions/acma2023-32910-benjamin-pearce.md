To the Minister,

Let the minister for Communications know that this citizen of Australia vehemently opposes the
"Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill
2023".

My God are we slipping ever more quickly down that slippery slope into an Orwellian Police State.

This legislation should be thrown immediately into the nearest bin and never referred to again unless
it be as a reference to how far NOT to go in an effort to ensure society has access to the truth.

There will ALWAYS BE misinformation and disinformation across all aspects of society. It is not the
government's role to tell us what is truth and what is falsity        - as such powers influence the
availability of ideas which the people can adopt and apply to their lives and also to their expectations
of government. It is not the Government's role to tell the people what is true, it is the responsibility
of the people themselves to understand truth and carry that understanding into their interactions
with other members of society and Government. How the people come to better identify truth is a
matter of education as well as the moral development of the culture of our society. It is NOT a
security issue.

We are indeed living in times of great falsity. The Government should focus on engaging with its
citizens on key issues facing our nation and convincing them of what is true and necessary, rather
than engaging in shadowy activities, enabled by legislation, that empower it to shut down alternative
views. Such activities will not strengthen our society in greater unity of understanding, but rather
divide us further than we have already become as the population's trust in their Government
continues to collapse under the use of such powers as prescribed in this legislation.

That's right, the population of the nation of Australia's trust in their government is in a state of
collapse. One need only look to the recent AUKUS deal and the Government's ineffective efforts to
convince the population that this is good for our national security, to see that. Will these powers be
used to force Australians to accept the deal through restriction of alternative views? The majority of
people who have already lost their trust in the Government will no doubt believe so. As do I.

This is the real danger to our society, the further destabilising of our social cohesion through outÂ­
right fascist security measures such as this legislation that will force freedom-loving Australians to
fight politically to depose the forces that have clearly hijacked our democracy and elevated their own
ambitions for power above the needs of the people.

This legislation highlights THAT TRUTH to be clear, may the Australian people see it defeated and
their rights to free-speech and expression of opinion safeguarded as a vanguard against liars,
manipulators, and charlatans too many of whom have already infiltrated elected positions as well as
bureaucratic positions within our Government already.

Make no further amendments to the draft Bill. Throw it out in its entirety.

Sincerely,

Benjamin Pearce
