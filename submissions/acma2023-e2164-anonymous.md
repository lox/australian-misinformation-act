 Submission - New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

Democracy is based on an exchange of ideas, and social medium is the new town square. Without freedom of expression, our country is
condemned to dictatorship or communism.
Recent experience of Covid -19 disaster illustrates the importance of open and free exchange of ideas.

Historically true independent journalism of the main stream media, offered a small degree of freedom of expression, over an extended period this
independence has disappeared in Australia (and world wide) as media ownership has contracted to very few people and independent thinking
investigative journalists have been sacked.

It was during Covid even parliamentarian speeches were removed from various social medium platform as their speeches differed from the
government narrative.

Recently the term “malformation” has been used increasingly. A term that is best described “information that is true but is inconvenient to the
government.”

Fact checkers, silenced many comments on social media, saying that it was disinformation, yet those same comments have latter to be proven as
true.

There are many examples of information that so called fact checks, said were false, but later shown to be correct.

So who determines what is correct is it a Government department called the “Ministry of Truth” who will correct any thing that is not in line with
government decisions of the day. Or maybe the arbiters of truth are a so called independent organisation financed through the back door by
companies, organisations or individuals who will gain significant advantage from policy decisions.

Democracy allows for differing views, it is this variety of ideas and experience that create and maintain a strong nation. How can independent
thinking be expressed in todays world that is being increasingly censored.

During the past few years we have experienced many, many, cases of social media censorship, so why are current changes being proposed.
Additional government powers will effectively enable a government of the day to silence any one who has a different view point to the
Government.

There is very strong legislation in Australia protecting Whistle blowers, so why is this relevant, If government shut down social media to silence
critics then the modern day town square has been silenced, South Australia has already banned public protests, so how can citizens blow the
whistle on government failures. Historically if citizens have a grievance that is not being processed, it would be revealed through main stream or
social media. Now main stream media can easily be bought out by government or corporations, shutting down of social media by government will
remove the last way citizens have a chance of making others aware of government failures.

The last few years represents the greatest failures of our government in Australian history, influenced by World Health Organisation (WHO) and
World Economic Forum (WEF) policies being in lock step, to create a one world government by 2030, many laws have been broken. The courts
are gradually revealing these failures. Recently the was found guilty of lying to the
Supreme Court’s Chief Justice, questioning the integrity of the court system. This is just one of many cases currently in court system that may
not have happened with out public comment on social media. Many police charges placed during covid have been dropped recently, as they
have been found to have no place in law Causing many people undue stress wasting precious government resources If there in no awareness


-----

The proposed changes are being promoted as some thing to protect the public from hate speech, actually the reverse is true, these changes will
make it possible for governments to hide from the people they are supposed to represent. This is part of the bigger worldwide plan to silence all
critics, making it easier to create one world government. As just like during Covid similar changes to these proposed changes are being made by
many nations who are under the spell of WHO & WEF. When is Australian government going to act to retain a democracy rather than continue a
path towards communism.
