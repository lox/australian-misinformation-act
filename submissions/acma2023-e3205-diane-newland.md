Submission on the Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

Freedom of speech is essential for people in our society. In some countries 'Big Brother' is
watching to catch, fine or jail anyone who does not repeat the 'mantra' of its government.
People's private thoughts dare not disagree with those in charge. The beauty of our society
for so long has been freedom of thought; respectfully being able to have differing opinions
on any subject. People of differing opinions should be able to argue their case online, in
public, without Big Brother censoring them.

Let's not become a 'police state'; rather let us learn to accept differing opinions and respect
others' rights to have them and argue them publicly, without fear. _Let's_ _keep_ _Australia_ _free!_
