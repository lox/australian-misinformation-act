    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The notion that any Government, or Government agency should be placed in a position whereby they are effectively to be placed above criticism of their actions and processes goes right to the heart of the basis of our liberal democratic society.",
      "Any attempt to alter this system is at best Authoritarian, and a huge overstep of the role of government.",
      "It does seem that the government wishes to control the narrative, and only those media that push put their line are to be allowed, this is not the behaviour of a free society, and reminds one of the Nazis in Germany nearly a century ago."
