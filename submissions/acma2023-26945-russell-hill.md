From reading through the proposed amendments there are a few conditions that raise

alarm bells for me, a person living in a Democratic Australia.

The first and main point is the ability to question your government. If the

government are exempt from the disinformation legislation it sets up a very

dangerous situation where the government may not be able to be questioned if the

subject for that questioning falls into what is classified as disinformation.

A fundamental condition in a Democracy is the ability to question and challenge the

government of the day and indeed any politician on their policies.

A free and open platform is vital to facilitate this process where differing views

can be put forward right or wrong with arguments to support those views.

One thing this does is it allows you to get a feeling of how and why people feel the

way they do and to understand generally how the range of people or population stand

on an issue. It is a feedback loop which is vital whether those view are erroneous

or not.

I have had my own views challenged and changed through this process by someone

challenging my view and backing that view with information that I was then able to

compare to what I previously thought. It was a long process of reading through both

sides of the argument and being honest with myself. We all need to have access to

that process. If one side of the argument is considered disinformation then that

opportunity no longer exists. There also usually exists truths in both arguments

that can lead to a greater understanding and possibly leading to an alternative

conclusion.

Second thing is platform providers cannot be put into a position of second guessing

themselves for fear of allowing disinformation.

How can they judge what that is? It is purely subjective and would lead to over

censorship.

A healthy democracy NEEDS free speech.

Hate speech is very subjective and amounts to saying something someone else

disagrees with. We need to be able to cope with differing views without being

mortally wounded, this is a resilience that is learnt over time and contributes to a

healthy debate and also forces you to double check your own information.

A direct threat of violence is not what I am talking about here.

If the population are not able to question their own government then they no longer

live in a Democracy.

Free Speech in a Democracy is the first thing a Government representing that

Democracy should protect, not the first thing it tries to control.

A Federal Democratic Government only represents the people of it's Country, not

anything outside of it's Country. Keeping that population sovereign, united,

prosperous, healthy, economically viable and resilient while representing them is

their main job, anything outside of this needs to be put to the population it

governs to freely and openly discuss and to make a decision on without coercion or

hate speech from those putting the proposal forward. I can handle it directed at me

because I can see it for what it is and that needs to be able to be questioned by me

which your amendments would prevent me from doing. In this case the government

should present their unbiased argument, this is where hate speech should be

eliminated, not in a healthy debate.

Most content providers have on their shows people called Mods who monitor chat on

their shows and remove people who are disrespectful or hostile towards that show or

audience. That is controlled at a local level and is all that is needed. This is of

a voluntary nature to that show, it is very effective.

To a platform where the scope is so broad this is not possible without infringing on

free speech. A direct threat to a person or body or posting inappropriate content

for an open audience should be controlled but should be treated in the same way it

is controlled in real life if someone is offensive in public. This does not mean

controlling the views or expression of those views by those same people if they can

do it in an appropriate way.

In summary, controlling people expressing views on a digital platform is not

appropriate as long as those views are presented in a way that is not threatening.

A healthy debate can be ugly at times and be erroneous but that is not a reason to

eradicate that argument because as I said, there will likely be truth within that

argument that needs to be heard and expressed, controlling or eliminating that

option because someone decided that it is false creates a pressure cooker situation

for a start that could lead to more extreme consequences.

There are many possible scenarios for stiflingly free speech, something that does

not belong in a Democracy.

Thankyou for the opportunity to put forward my views.
