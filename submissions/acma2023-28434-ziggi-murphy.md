I am very disappointed in the governments overreach of making laws about what people are allowed
to say or not. It is not the government’s responsibility to decide what can and cannot be said. What
happened to free speech? I defend anyone’s right to free speech; I don’t have to agree with them,
but I defend their right to speak. This bill takes away the right to speak and have an opinion. This is a
very dangerous and over arching bill.

People are entitled to have an opinion or belief based on their lived experiences. The covid era has
allowed for the proclamation of the words ‘disinformation’ and ‘misinformation’. These words were
barely heard of in mainstream media or out the mouths of politicians prior to 2020. So why now put
forward such an overreaching bill.

The covid era has also shown that ‘Opinion’ or ‘expert opinion’ or even ‘follow the science’
highlighted that ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ did in fact come from media outlets and
government officials. As was highlighted by the recent discovery that many of the
“misinformation/disinformation being spread around about covid 19 in the beginning did in fact turn
out to be true. Such as:

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating COVID-19 was leaked from a lab in
Wuhan

**FACT:** **In May 2021, Anthony Fauci, who had spent more than a year denying the theory, finally**
**admitted that Covid-19 probably came from a lab. Leaked emails of Fauci’s indicated that he was**
**aware of Covid’s probable lab origins as early as January of 2020, but he spent two years trying to**
**cover up the scandal to hide that his agency had funded the gain-of-function research that led to**
**Covid-19’s lab leak.**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating the vaccine are not safe and they don’t
prevent transmission. Various medical professionals were denied and cancelled for saying such
things.

**FACT:** **The conspiracy theories were in fact correct as even although the original trials showed**
**problems and the vaccines were still allowed to be given to millions of Australians, with a vast**
**number being given by force bullying and coercion and in doing so violated the immunisation**
**handbook guidelines. It was then and later well documented that there were in fact risks with**
**taking the vaccine including, death, myocarditis, Bell's Palsy, anaphylaxis, and paralysis. Countries**
**started suspensions and stopping certain vaccines. The CDC halted the Johnson & Johnson vaccine**
**in response to multiple cases of blood clotting and other serious side effects. In Australia ATAGI**
**noted further evidence of a rare but serious side effect involving thrombosis (clotting) with**
**thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) following receipt of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.**
**They recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer (Comirnaty) is preferred over COVID-19**
**Vaccine AstraZeneca in adults aged under 50 years. The World Health Organization has**
**documented millions of cases of adverse reactions. Woman reporting interference with women’s**
**menstruation cycle, and potentially since there are no long-term studies their fertility. No one can**
**deny now that the vaccine dramatically increases the chances of serious heart illnesses. Studies**
**have shown that low-risk groups are up to 6 times more likely of having a severe adverse reaction**
**to the vaccine than to be hospitalized with Covid. In January of 2022 the CDC admitted that while**
**the vaccines can make symptoms less severe, “what they can’t do anymore is prevent**
**transmission.”. In Israel their researchers stated that even a 4th dose of the Covid vaccine is “not**
**good enough” to stop the spread of Covid-19.**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating COVID deaths and hospitalization
numbers are being inflated.

**FACT:** **Many people whose deaths were classified as Covid deaths had actually died “with Covid”**
**rather than “of Covid,” this was artificially inflating the Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations**
**numbers. Many people who said this were censored or ridiculed. However, statistics showed that**
**over 40% of “Covid patients” in New York City had actually been admitted for “non-COVID**
**reasons.” For the initial two years of the pandemic, a number of states in America didn’t**
**distinguish between “primary” and “incidental” Covid-19 hospitalizations. One state had to drop**
**its Covid death count by 37,000 after adopting the new criteria. States were “overreporting Covid-**
**19 cases by up to 13 percent by counting anyone who ‘tests positive for Covid-19 and subsequently**
**died’ as a coronavirus death.” One state even counted gunshot victims as Covid deaths if they had**
**“tested positive for Covid-19 within the last 30 days.”. Florida was found to have included a**
**motorcycle crash victim as a Covid death. The CDC and Mr Fauci finally admitted that many “Covid**
**patients” were actually being “hospitalized with Covid, as opposed to because of Covid.” More**
**concerning is the fact that the CDC retracted silently more than 72,000 Covid deaths from its Covid**
**death count with little explanation.**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating Wearing of Cloth masks is not effective.

**FACT: At first masks were not to be worn then they were even Dr Fauci said not to wear masks**
**there was no good reason. The CDC did not recommend the use of face coverings. Yet in only a**
**couple of weeks everything changed with no clear scientific justification. Many studies showed**
**that mask mandates didn’t slow the spread of Covid-19. The head of the CDC Mr fauci admitted**
**that he wore a mask so as not to confuse people. In January of 2022, the CDC finally admitted that**
**cloth masks didn’t offer significant protection against the virus. Of course, Biden’s Covid advisor**
**Michael Osterholm admitted that “cloth masks are little more than facial decorations.”**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating Lockdowns don’t work.

**FACT:A meta-analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the Centre for Political Studies**
**in Copenhagen, and Lund University concluded that lockdowns only reduced Covid mortality by a**
**mere 0.2%.**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating natural immunity is more effective than
vaccination.

**FACT:** **After originally insisting that vaccinations offered more protection than previous infection,**
**the CDC released a new study in January of 2022 contradicting its original claims. A study from**
**Israeli suggested that this protection can be 13 times more effective than vaccination. The Project**
**Veritas investigation showed multiple Pfizer scientists confessing to an undercover journalist that**
**“your [Covid] antibodies are better than the [Pfizer] vaccination.” Natural immunity has always**
**been a scientific fact. To think that what was once a well-known occurrence before 2020 became a**
**dangerous conspiracy theory.**

So called conspiracy misinformation/disinformation stating the vaccines interfere with menstruation
cycles.


-----

**FACT: Studies from the NIH and the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published in January of**
**2022 revealed that the vaccine can indeed lead to delays in the onset of menstrual periods.**

As shown above opinions or so called “facts” are not always correct and based on the information
above people would have been in in trouble for spreading misinformation or disinformation when in
fact what they were saying was true and backed by evidence. How are you going to determine what
is true or false? Surely that would come down to ‘someone’s’ opinion? Who gives them authority
over all Australians to be the “godlike” thinker of wisdom. “My opinion is the ‘true’ opinion”.
