I write to oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

This Bill is a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of all Australians and residents,
and to our democracy, society, and our economy.

I oppose this Bill for the following reasons;

1. This Bill will cause harm to the integrity of all Australian’s and residents
democratic processes.

2. This Bill is a direct threat to free speech.

3. This Bill is will harm the wellbeing of natural conscious free thinking.

4. This Bill will create and cause mental and physiological harm.

5. This Bill is will harm industries and business reliant on social media and
internet services.

6. This Bill denies facts.

7. This Bill denies truth.

8. This bill allows for government individuals personal opinion from unchecked
emotional character baseline to make decisions upon their belief systems and
ideology to interpretate misinformation or disinformation based on their
feelings and grievances, from a flawed and one sided mindset in the absence
of reasonable balanced reasoned thinking. (We would not need such
legislation if government were balanced and understanding of true
democracy).

9. No government department should be allowed to interfere with anyone’s
thinking creativity or expression of thought.

10. This Bill denies education and personal debate and discussion.

11 .This Bill denies freedom of all religion’s to preach and worship as it sees fit.

12. This Bill is not represented by all the people of Australia and should be put to
the people the same way the existing government is campaigning a relentless
in your face yes vote for the Voice to Parliament.

13. This Bill does not define, separate government misinformation and
disinformation i.e. smoking is good for you, asbestos, thalidomide
propaganda.

14. This Bill does not define the full process and functions of end users.

15. This Bill does not protect individuals from government misinformation and
disinformation.

16. This Bill does not allow the absence of foreign powers of unelected powers of
individuals, foundations, associations or corporations to interfere with the
Australian way of life.

In my opinion this Bill is dangerous to the people of Australia. It’s disingenuous and I
believe has been created to give false public sense of on line “safety” as a prelude to
act as a gatekeeper for Government surveillance and future human controls.

As the creators of this legislation used free thinking to poorly draft his Bill thus using
their natural conscience living right so must those be allowed the same rights to
oppose this legislation.

This Bill goes against natural conscious living condition of living humans and is not fit
for purpose, its unethical and government overreach.

The Bill must be made clear to the public for fairness and due process, as this Bill
has been disguised. It has not been appropriately nor officiously advertised to the
public as you have done with a one sided yes Voice to Parliament agenda. Wisdom
has two sides, democracy has two sides. This Bill is one sided.

I recommendation                 - this Bill in its current form be suspended.
2. Redrafted         - to include free speech protections for living humans in Australia

3. Resubmitted to the public

4. Vigorously widely advertised to the public with a wider date range

This Bill does not represent living Australians. This submission falls short of proper
public consultation as the government is really asking Australians to sign away their
rights. The Prime Minister has said he will govern for all Australians and residents,
this legislation proves the PM’s comment to be a lie.

A government that is prepared to censor a different point of view contrary to a
government view point or narrative or agenda in the absence of fully informed
consent and remiss of proper checks and balances of natural rights of free thinking
without discussion and debate is dictatorship it is not leadership.

I strongly oppose this Bill.
