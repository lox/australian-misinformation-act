Dear Officer,

I strongly object to this proposed new Bill.

This proposed amendment of the Communications Legislation is an abomination to Our Human
Rights, which are stated below in article 19 from the Australian Government website:

https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/commission-general/universal-declaration-human-rightshuman-rights-your-fingertips-human

Article 19 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

**_Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold_**
**_opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any_**
**_media and regardless of frontiers._**

# Therefore this proposed amendment must not proceed any further than a proposal. It must be removed and terminated.

In fact the deplorable nature of this proposed bill, poses a very long list of unanswered questions
and are not limited to such as these:
  - Who’s Truth ?

  - Who’s Harm ?

  - Who would call the information False ?

  - Who would define the Truth ?

  - Who would define Misinformation ?

  - Who would define Disinformation ?

  - Who would define Serious Harm ?

  - Why does this proposed bill Not apply to Government or main stream media ?

Once a Government starts Censoring the People, then the People and the Country are well and truly
on the Road to Dystopia and Totalitarianism.

The corner foundation stone of our system in Australia and indeed the Western World is, freedom of
speech. All of the other freedoms depend this. If we lose that, we lose our democracy in this
country.

If we are not able to ask sceptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true,
to be sceptical of those in authority, then we're up for grabs for the next charlatan, political or
religious, who comes ambling along.
It is not enough to enshrine some rights in a constitution, the people need freedom of speech,
education and they must practice their scepticism, their education and their free speech.
Otherwise, the people do not run the government, the government runs the people.

Regards

Concerned Person
