To the Australian Government,

I am against the following proposed powers because granting them will allow the ACMA to

force digital platforms to silence points of views that aren't favoured by the ACMA, curbing the
right of free speech of the common people. Such power is undue in a democratic society because
the ACMA, being a government agency, has no right to decide whether something is
'misinformation' or 'disinformation' on behalf of the people; it is ultimately up to the people to
practice discernment and decide for themselves. The following powers should not be granted to
the ACMA:

  - enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering measures to
combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms, which the ACMA could
register and enforce

  - allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of regulation),
should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting misinformation and
disinformation on digital platforms.

Sincerely,
