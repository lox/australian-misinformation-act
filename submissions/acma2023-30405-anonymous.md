RE : New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

It is very concerning that people will have their ability to access information from all
resources removed. How is anyone able to make an informed choice on any subject matter
with out being able to research all sides.

Once we are restricted on what information we are able to access this takes objective criticism
away.

The same as if some one is injured and it is recommended they go to hospital they can still refuse to
do so. Or recommended chemo cancer treatment but alternative natural treatments are available and
people have found these to work but this is withheld because a co-operation may loose money.

We should have access to all information so we can make our own choice on what is good for us.
As has been shown on numerous occasions where we are told trust the science but only given
research from one perspective, that is not science it is dictatorship.

What classifies something as misinformation? All information can be classed as misinformation by
whom ever pays the highest price to have that information classified as such. If we can walk into a
Library and access books from all categories, including fiction, majority of people do understand
this to be fiction. The same with any information people can choose how they interpret what they
have. Hence we need to be able to have access to all information.

As with a contract where there is the small print people can choose to read it or not but whatever
they do the consequence is on them. So should the same be for our access to ALL INFORMATION
not just what a select few want us to see.
