**Submission** **to** **the** **Department** **of** **Infrastructure,** **Transport,** **Regional** **Development,**
##### Communications and the Arts: Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
**Misinformation** **and** **Disinformation)** **Bill** **2023**

The implications of this proposed bill are grave. The concept is antidemocratic. If it
goes ahead it will have severe unintended consequences for the welfare of Australians.

The central tenet behind it is that people in various kinds of authority, in forms of
##### government, and of policymaking, are the exclusive deciders of truth. This is so absurd it
should not need argument to dismiss it. However, seeing it has travelled this far, it seems
##### that argument must be provided.

As an editor and speechwriter to the General Assembly of the United Nations I
have been in a position to be constantly confronted by a continuum of all sorts of
##### inadequacies in policies. After governmental functionaries and agencies have been sufficiently addressed by competing interests, the legislative outcomes may be in a sorry
state. When this happens, our system allows and should always allow for perceived
problems to be thoroughly aired.

Sad to say, the numbers of such perceived and unresolved problems are increasing
##### steadily across the nation. Many people are dissatisfied. Censorship is playing a substantial part in encouraging grievance and disenfranchisement. Without respected appropriate
outlets, stymied information sours into conspiracy theory and this does nobody any good.

What is remarkable here is the size and scope of relevant and largely unaddressed
issues. Enormous damage is being done in this country as a result of the often inspired and
equally often vast efforts of vested interests. The overseas drug companies have simply
##### taken over and run this nation during COVID, and in the submission you have received you will be seeing this said again and again. Once the established media lock onto an idea
and decide to promote a government position        - or at least not to disparage it        - then it will
continue, regardless of the outcomes.

This can only occur successfully when dissenting voices are carefully silenced, as
##### dictators and fascist and communist governments have long known.

There are now many arenas in modem Australia where people are being damaged
to the point of death as a result of poor policy. To assume that whatever it is it must have
been adequately tested if it has been locked into place and become law, policy or
regulation is simple-minded nonsense. And to select a single brief example for purposes of
##### this submission is no easy task. However: let us begin with the matter of pesticide policy.


-----

##### Five people in four legal trials (one couple and three individuals) have been awarded twenty thousand million US dollars -1 write it so there will be no confusion of the zeroes - by American juries in damages for cancer using glyphosate according to
instructions. One was a school gardener. The couple used spray packs in their gardens.
Their cancers are terminal. They may be dead by now.

##### Bayer-Monsanto had these awards given against them not for simply having faulty
research. The awards against them were given because their research was actually
fraudulent. This is why the payment figures are so high.

These were the first four cases. There are over four hundred in the American
system now being processed and yet to come. There is also one going on in Australia.

The bulk of the independent scientific research is coming from The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. There is a group of scientists now saying glyphosate is worse than
DDT. In Sydney, recent studies have shown mothers’ milk still today to be containing
DDT. It was banned in Australia in 1976.

This is not the worst of it. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and the
##### Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority do not do their own research.
They calmly accept the documentation sent here by the manufacturing companies.

The TGA receives 96%          - ninety-six per cent          - of its funding from American drug
companies.

To clarify this a little further, here is a diagram of the chemical action concerned          -
##### something which nobody in this country ever discusses.

The human body has no wiring, so electrical impulses skate along through nerves.
The body lays down acetylcholine to serve as the conduit. The fuel for this is magnesium
##### (of which the Australian continent is notoriously short). As the charge travels along, it
burns the fuel and this action leaves rubble. The body then throws in acetylcholineacetate
to clear this detritus and prepare the way for the next charge soon to follow.

##### Electrical charge travels along this track,
, , leaving rubble Acetylcholineacetate
##### Acetylcholine
 clears the rubble
 \ Magnesium = the fuel

Pesticide destroys this process by blocking the natural formation of
acetylcholineacetate, thereby leaving behind the rubble, and this hinders the electrical
##### charge-and-discharge that runs the body. The charge is caught in the rubble. A cell charges

and discharges often at around forty times a second, and this facility is essential for life.
Depending upon the body type, the pesticide gathers in the organs of its choice, creating
##### electrical interference fields, so the organ function drops, and a wide variety of illness results over time, with cancer, heart disease and stroke all featuring. Independent science is
now making this plain, and you, the reader of this short missive, are joining hands with
##### your family at home while you have your daily intake of glyphosate, as does everybody
else in Australia, so widespread are its use. It accumulates.

##### Now, if I put this a little more bluntly, every day the media in this country endorse public servants’ contentment with the legality of use of a pesticide capable of this action, both groups contribute to severe threats and damage to people’s health and lives. Country
after country has removed glyphosate from public sale since this information began to
come out. Not Australia. The orthodox medical system in this country has no
##### understanding of or interest in the electrics of the human body (despite the length of time
most of the Chinese and a substantial part of the Russian medical systems have run on
acupuncture, to say nothing of incidental countries such as France which have done their
own work on it). Medicine here has no frame of reference to deal with this issue.

##### When I was bombed with glyphosate by helicopter courtesy of the local forestries, I complained in writing about this profligate and particular use of glyphosate to six
appropriate members of parliament. Each of them brushed me off and asserted that it was
not their problem, and the substance concerned is under the capable management of the
##### Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority.

 Recently there came this news report:

# Chemical regulator board chair and CEO resign after urine scandal

### A horrific streak of disturbing complaints within one of Australia’s largest
#### regulators have surfaced as its head honcho resigns.

 ^^Brooke Rolfe

Damning findings within Australia’s chemical regulator, including an incident of an employee
urinating on their colleagues, have emerged at its board chair and CEO stand down.

Staff at all levels at the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) were
found to have been subject to regular complaints of misconduct in a review commissioned by
Agriculture Minister Murray Watt.

The review, released on Friday, came after allegations surfaced in a Senate inquiry suggesting an
employee urinated on colleagues following a workplace Christmas party.

The incident was referred to the public service commissioner and police in February.

According to the reviewer, law firm Clayton Utz. the alleged urination was just one example of deep


-----

“There were clearly cultural issues with the organisation given that on average there was a formal
complaint about once every 4-6 weeks for five years.” Clayton Utz said.

“There are also a significant number of complaints that refer to serious impacts for the persons
involved, including numerous instances of employees having to take periods of stress leave or feeling
unable to attend work due to mental health concerns.”

The agriculture minister said the report had highlighted significant and systemic internal problems.

“The number and range of issues at the APVMA have turned out to be far wider than I think any of
us expected.” Senator Watt said, according to ABC News.

“Concerningly. the review found serious allegations of chemical industry capture of the APVMA.
which appears to have played a key role in the organisation not performing its full regulatory
responsibilities.”

The reviewer has recommended an urgent “re-evaluation of the APVMA’s engagement with
industry” — an assertion Senator Watt has agreed to.

While the review determined the authority, which is responsible for approving products like
weedkiller glyphosate, had not failed to register chemicals appropriately, it had been doing so at a
hyper slow rate.

In some cases, it had taken decades to review chemicals.

“Of the 10 ongoing chemical reviews, eight have been in progress for over 15 years or more, with
seven ongoing for nearly 20 years.” reviewers said.

Senator Watt has since commissioned former public servant Ken Matthews to conduct a fresh
inquiry into the APVMA’s governance and culture.

He said initial findings concerned him enough that he feared food safety could be compromised in
the future if the issues raised weren’t addressed.

I think I may now comfortably ask whether the readers of this present document
##### would be inclined to passively hand over their families’ health and welfare to a body such
as that described above, and to accept that, shall we say, standing governmental orders are
always correct and beyond questioning. Or, perhaps alternatively, might it be sensible and
appropriate to say that censorship of the kind to follow inevitably from the proposed Bill is
##### wholly unacceptable in a functional democracy?

Bodies in authority continue to assert their dominance over communications in this
country, and the damage is huge. Try these:

(1) Renal colic is one of the most painful conditions known. It causes a lot of
screaming and lapsing into unconsciousness. When it sets in it can last for days and nights
##### with no remission. The medical system offers morphine or fentanyl for it. The medical
textbooks say opiates must never be used for spasm. Renal colic is spasm. So the exact wrong


-----

##### treatment (it diminishes the symptoms temporarily while making the spasm worse) is given, despite the fact that medical texts say this should not be done. And, the whole time, there is
a European treatment, used particularly in Germany and Austria, which cures it         - not
ameliorates the symptoms, but cures it         - within minutes. This is an acupuncture-like
##### treatment that instantly relaxes the ureter’s spasm, and it has virtually no cost. I know a very highly trained European doctor who was sacked from a hospital for making people well with this, because it is not “part of the protocol.”

(2) Mercury has a half-life in the human body of 25 to 30 years. Many people have
##### had dental amalgams removed. Mercury has been shown (University of Calgary, The Smoking Tooth) to pour out of fillings. Mercury when it methylates, which it does in the
mouth, is the most vicious non-radio-active poison on the planet. It plays a part in every
known health condition and it crosses the placenta. No study has ever been written and
shown it safe (that is, shown that the mercury does not leak), and there are over a thousand
studies now questioning its safety. Now that the dental people are tending towards newer
resins, they claim to be “de-emphasizing” mercury fillings. But with a half-life so long in
##### the body, removal is only a small part of the equation. Nobody anywhere is paying attention
to this. How do people (even if they have their fillings changed) detoxify? The medical and
dental systems say nothing.

(3) Milk in this country is heavily homogenized. The process is to blend the cream
into the mixture. It actually smashes the protein molecule and releases a chemical called
xanthine oxidase. This chemical bonds with plasmogen, the natural arterial repair substance
##### produced by the body. The result is damage in the form of hardening of the arteries. Everywhere milk is homogenized, country by country, vascular disease figures rise. The
science has all been done (Oster, Ross, University of Fairfield, Connecticut) but the food­
technology industry prefers to sell damaged milk because it has a longer shelf life. Doctors
once again are entirely uninterested.

These examples all speak to the requirement for more freedom of speech and less
censorship. This question may be rhetorical, but it is still genuine: how in the world can
people of power be brought to give account for poor work if those individuals and small
groups in the real world find their communications crimped even further than they are now?

This proposed bill is ridiculous. It should die on the vine.
