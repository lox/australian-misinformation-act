I completely oppose the proposed Disinformation bill in its entirety, its intent being totally opposite to what a free
enterprise and democratic society like Australia should be.
We should be a free thinking, open minded and creative society   - which we have been.
Australia has prospered by encouraging new ideas and debate. This bill will ensure Australia becomes a totalitarian
state and the will of its people becomes submerged by government decree.
Our forefathers fought hard for our democracy & we should never consider giving it up if the nation is to continue to
prosper.
Most of the wide range of immigrants from other countries came here to escape such proposed oppressive
regulations

Those advocating this Bill are actually committing treason.
Adrian Lee,
