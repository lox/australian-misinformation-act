**SUBMISSION ON PROPOSED “COMBATING MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BILL”**

I am extremely concerned about the proposed “Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill”.

I understand this is proposed may be an attempt to eliminate some of the evils of social media but it
is something like hitting a fly with a sledge hammer. Everything around gets smashed while the fly
escapes.

This bill would completely remove freedom of speech from our country and is a breach of our human
rights. It puts control of what opinions or facts are allowed to be dispersed via social media in the
hands of the social media giants who, mainly because of the huge fines potentially incurred, would
block everything they thought the government would not approve of. What qualifies them to be the
arbitrators of free speech, to determine what is “misinformation” and what is “disinformation”? In
fact, no-one should have this control in a democracy, which by definition allows everyone the freedom
to hold and express their own views.

This bill would change our government from a democracy to a dictatorship. The fact that the
government and mainstream media are exempt from these provisions is even more concerning
because that means that everything the government says is classed as truth with anything contrary to
that being classed as “misinformation or disinformation”.

A good example of how this would affect the country is the current debate on the proposed aboriginal
Voice to Parliament. The general public would not be able to hear the case against this proposal as it
would be considered “misinformation or disinformation” and therefore blocked on social media. This
is particularly concerning as so many people only go to social media for information. How can a major
change to our constitution be instigated in a democratic country without the population being fully
informed? This would mean citizens would have to vote without knowing both sides of the debate.
That is how it works in a dictatorship.

I trust you will consider the concerns raised in this submission in a reasonable way.
