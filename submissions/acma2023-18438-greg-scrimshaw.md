**Proposed Changes Regarding ACMA Powers**

I strongly disagree with the proposed changes, which would force social media companies to remove
posts which may be classed as misinformation or disinformation.

For starters, this would mean that the government of the day could determine exactly what IS
misinformation or disinformation. We saw many instances during the COVID pandemic of people
making statements on social media, which were called out as misinformation, which turned out to
be true.

Sharri Markson's report on the origins of COVID were dismissed by government and media alike as
misinformation. Again, now proven otherwise.

If we go down the road of Governments deciding what is true and what is false, we may as well be
living in China, Russia or North Korea. Particularly when governments blatantly make false claims
themselves.

The only posts which should ever be removed are ones involving personal abuse, making threats,
pornography, etc.

When people put false information up on social media, it will be the public who determines whether
or not it is true. If governments try to hide even false information, it gives the conspiracy theorists
more weight to their arguments.

Bottom line, you need to shine a light on false statements, not hide them away. If social media
platforms become a tool of government to control information, then George Orwell had it right.
