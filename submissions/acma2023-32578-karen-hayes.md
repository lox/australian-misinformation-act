Submission re: draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I do not support this Bill. I do not want a governing body deciding on what information I can and
can't access. One's Freedom of Speech should never, ever be removed. I agree that there are issues
of manipulation of information, but I do not trust any government to make an unbiased decision in

such sensitive matters.

Sincerely

Karen Hayes
