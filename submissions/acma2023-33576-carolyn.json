      "The legislation is a form of state censorship disguised as protection against misinformation.",
      "The proposed law threatens free speech and democratic discourse by silencing dissenting voices.",
      "The legislation is based on flawed research that misrepresents disagreement with government narratives as misinformation.",
      "The law will harm independent media and platforms that provide refuge for dissenting opinions."
    ],
    "Main Themes": [

    ],
    "Notable Quotes": [
      "This is outsourced state censorship, totalitarian in scope, designed to control the public conversation and camouflaged as protection.",
      "The government should not be in the business of determining 'truth' for the Australian public.",
      "ACMA cannot know what is true and therefore cannot set censorship rules.",
      "This legislation is a power grab by an unelected bureaucracy that would get to decide what 'misinformation' is for all of us and ban it, strangling our democracy."
