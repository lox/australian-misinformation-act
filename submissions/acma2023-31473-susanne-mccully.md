To whom it may concern,

I never thought that I would live to see the day when it would be proposed that Australia should have
an honest to goodness Ministry of Truth. This is not simply bad policy – this is evil.

Your stated aim is to prevent the spread of misinformation. So what is misinformation?

According to your fact sheet –

**Misinformation is:**

  - content disseminated using a digital service that is false, misleading or deceptive; and

  - the content is provided on the digital service to one or more end-users in Australia; and

  - the provision of the content on the digital service is reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious
harm; and

  - the content is not excluded for misinformation purposes, with that content being:

      - content produced in good faith for the purposes of entertainment, parody or satire

      - professional news content

      - content authorised by the Australian or a, State, Territory or Local Government

      - content produced by or for an accredited education provider.

NOTE: Content made in response to the above excluded types of content is not automatically
also excluded for misinformation purposes (i.e. comments on a professional news article).


**Disinformation is:**

  - content that fulfils the criteria for misinformation; and

  - the content is disseminated with intent to deceive, including through automated processes and foreign
interference. This captures content that is purposefully or maliciously disseminated disinformation.


Leaving aside that terrible English in the fourth point down, I think it means that you will exclude
from these provisions Government and professional news content. They are, it seems, good sources
for information – really! Let’s look at some recent history.

In 2021 the COVID 19 vaccines were rolled out in Australia. We were told over and over, ad
nauseum, that the “vaccines” were “safe and effective”. Before making such a sweeping statement,
there should have been evidence to support the assertion. There was not. There could not have been.
To show that a medicine is safe you need to complete Phase 1 testing. To show that it is effective you
need to complete Phase 3 testing.[1] None of this had been completed prior to the beginning of the roll
out.

– Phase 3 experimental period did not end till May 23rd 2023[2]

– Phase 3 trial period did not end till February 14th 2023[3]

– Phase one trials did not end till November 22nd 2022 [4]

In fact, the various phases were being run concurrently with each other and with a heavily pushed
world wide roll out. What could possible go wrong??

A very great deal! Time has shown clearly that they do not work and are extremely dangerous. We
are getting young people having heart attacks and soccer players dropping dead on the field – super
fit athletes dropping dead of heart failure.[5] Safe and effective is not a lie – it is two lies! Many highly
qualified scientists and doctors tried to warn us but were censored. This censorship was evil and
destructive. If these voices had been heard, much death and disability could have been avoided.

The Government was the source of misinformation and the professional news people pushed it
heavily but let’s not mince words – the government lied and people died! In 2022, according to ABS
figures, there were 25,235 excess deaths in Australia. It is telling that the page giving this
information has since been deleted. It is also telling that the Australian government refuses to have
any kind of enquiry into either the CIVID response or the excess deaths.

Now we need to examine the proposed laws against this background. Who is going to decide what is
misinformation? Who has the right? You are not dealing with children. This is insulting. We are adult
people who are perfectly capable of looking at all the information and reaching our own conclusions.
Or maybe that is the problem – adult people who can access a variety of information can work out
what is true and what is not. The government lies cannot stand when exposed to the truth.

At the end of the day, you can try to stop us from finding out the truth but it will not work. The
former Soviet Union tried to stop the spread of information but a thriving samizdat press was
created. Those people copied pamphlets by hand and smuggled them from person to person. We can
do something similar but we have computers and printers and private messaging services. You may
drive the truth underground but you cannot kill it.

At the end of the day, the writings of George Orwell were indented to be a warning – not an
instruction manual!!
