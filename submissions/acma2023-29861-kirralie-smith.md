Subject: Submissions on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
and Disinformation) Bill 2023

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the draft bill titled "Communications
Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023". As an Australian
citizen and a firm believer in the fundamental principles of freedom of speech, I am appalled by the
implications and consequences this bill could have on our democratic society.

Firstly, the existence of this bill itself is indicative of the Australian Government's lack of respect for
the freedom of speech of its citizens. By creating two distinct categories of citizens, this bill
perpetuates an unjust power dynamic, wherein politicians, journalists, and members of educational
institutions are granted the authority to spread information, regardless of its accuracy, while the rest
of the citizens are subject to draconian restrictions.

The Internet, being the most powerful democratic invention of humanity, has empowered regular
people by giving them a voice. This law, however, poses a significant risk to the ability of regular
citizens to exercise their democratic right to expression. The excessive fines imposed by this bill will
undeniably lead to greater speech restrictions on digital services, surpassing even the most stringent
limitations currently in place. Furthermore, the wide-ranging application of the code without any
"pressure escape valves" intensifies the detrimental impact on free speech.

Moreover, the task of accurately discerning what is true or false is an impossible one. New
information is constantly emerging, challenging previously held beliefs and expert consensus. It is
crucial to acknowledge that many statements, which were once considered authoritative and factual,
have later turned out to be false. Examples such as the initial beliefs about mask effectiveness and
the transmission of COVID-19 highlight how the boundaries of truth are ever-evolving. Under this
legislation, content disseminating such evolving information may be mistakenly flagged as public
health misinformation, leading to censorship.


-----

What is even more concerning is that this bill targets not only false information but also information
that may be deemed as "misleading" or "deceptive". Freedom of speech allows for open and honest
discussions, enabling truth to be debated and common ground to be found. By restricting the right to
be wrong, this bill infringes upon this essential element of free speech. Even experts, like Dr. Nick
Coatsworth, have raised justifiable concerns about the scope and implementation of this bill, further
highlighting the problematic nature of this legislation.

The bill's focus on larger platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter neglects the unintended
consequences it may impose on thousands of community websites constituting the "social web". The
broad definitions within the bill inadvertently expose countless website owners, including those
overseas, to exorbitant fines and legal risks. The international implications of this bill, particularly in
relation to the Mastodon social media network, raise questions about the enforcement and
compliance measures that would potentially hinder freedom of speech across borders.

This bill, which claims to protect minorities, may, in fact, suppress them. Often, minorities challenge
established beliefs and drive progress by presenting alternative perspectives. By imposing a single
code and stifling diverse viewpoints, this bill denies minorities the potential to challenge the status
quo. This move contradicts the principles upon which progress is built and undermines the core
values of a democratic society.

The delegation of legislative power to private entities under this bill raises significant constitutional
concerns. Granting companies the ability to create Misinformation Codes, which then become law,
bypasses parliamentary oversight and potentially infringes upon the implied freedom of political
communication. The broad definition of "harm" within the bill further reinforces the potential
curtailment of this constitutional freedom, as political debates and matters of public interest become
subject to arbitrary and contested judgments.

Furthermore, the assumption that government and authorized media and educational institutions
possess the ultimate truth, disregarding the experiences and viewpoints of ordinary Australians,
undermines the democratic principles of inclusion and diversity. Deplatforming certain views before
they can be shared inhibits the process of sense-making and suppresses the exploration of all
possibilities. This bill unjustly portrays ordinary people as incapable of engaging in public discourse
without the risk of causing harm, while simultaneously assuming that the viewpoints of the
government and accredited entities are inherently less harmful.

The provisions within the bill that threaten Digital Platform Providers and ordinary users, often
referred to as "Deplorables", with reputational damage, financial penalties, and interference are
deeply concerning. The harsh consequences imposed on Digital Platform Providers could result in
significant financial loss and undermine the very foundations of these businesses. Similarly,
summoning citizens before ACMA and urging them to report on their friends and families reeks of a
totalitarian system, reminiscent of oppressive regimes.


-----

The repercussions for independent media organizations, journalists, and bloggers are equally
distressing. Subjecting them to complex reporting standards and misinformation reports, with the
intention to damage their reputations, creates an imbalanced playing field. This imbalance favors
government-approved publications and restricts free and independent journalism.

As an Australian citizen, it is disheartening and deeply concerning to witness the proposed erosion of
our fundamental freedoms and the subsequent infringements upon our democratic values. The draft
bill, in its current form, undermines the principles of freedom of speech, diversity, and open dialogue
that form the bedrock of our democratic society.

I strongly urge the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications,
and the Arts to reconsider the implications of this bill and its potential consequences for Australian
citizens. Critical engagement and open discussion with various stakeholders are essential to ensure
that any legislation enacted truly upholds the values we hold dear as Australians.

Thank you for considering my submission. I trust that you will take into account the concerns raised
herein, and I hope to see a constructive dialogue surrounding this bill in the coming months.

Yours sincerely,

Kirralie Smith
