    "Overall Position": "Neutral/Mixed",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The report provides a comprehensive overview of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in Western Australia for 2021, with a significant focus on COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "There was a substantial increase in AEFI reports in 2021 due to the COVID-19 vaccination program, with 10,726 reports compared to an average of 276 per year from 2017-2020.",
      "The rates of AEFI for COVID-19 vaccines in WA were similar to national rates, though higher than those reported in the USA, likely due to differences in reporting systems.",
      "The report highlights the importance of both passive and active surveillance systems in monitoring vaccine safety.",
      "Specific adverse events of special interest (AESI) such as anaphylaxis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), and myocarditis were monitored closely."

    "Notable Quotes": [
      "The high number of reports in 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination reflects higher uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, and high engagement from the public and health care providers with the monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "Although there was a notable increase in AEFI reports, rates of AEFI across the three COVID-19 vaccines administered in WA in 2021 were similar to national rates reported by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)."
