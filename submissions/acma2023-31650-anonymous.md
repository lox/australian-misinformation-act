Dear members of ACMA,

Re: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation

Attached is my response to the new AMCA powers.

Please refrain from publishing any of my personal details including my email address, home
address or my mobile number. I do not agree to that, thank you.

Living in a democratic nation all my life, I hold free speech, free opinion and free debate at the
very forefront of integrity and importance.

History has shown us that not all Leaders, Scientists and Media have been accurate with their
ideas, stories and information all of the time, which has resulted in people going down a path of
absolute horror and devastation. This would never have happened had the voices of difference
been allowed to express their views and ideas without fear of retribution.

I can see from the powers that you are trying to introduce, that we will be walking a very
dangerous path again. A path that could lead to destruction and corruption.

Different viewpoints and debate causes a healthier society. Voices removed from society cause
fear, belittlement, ignorance and lack of respect and intellectual growth.

The Covid 19 pandemic response has shown that information presented by world leaders and
Scientists has now been proven to be false, or itself misinformed.  Censorship already occurred
during this time and if it had not been for that censorship, so much damage would not have
occurred. The voices of reason and debate could have saved far greater numbers from death and
injury.

While I condemn any kind of hate speech and threats on peoples way of life, I feel there must be
balance and freedom to express the views of everyone.

In conclusion, I categorically object to the new powers to combat misinformation and
disinformation, because the misinformation and disinformation is only classified as such, by the
people in power who do the highest bidding.

Kind regards,
