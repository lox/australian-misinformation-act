I wish to voice my objection to this Bill. Originally, I had intended of being more scholarly and civil in
my objection to this legislation and the supporting documentation provided by the government,
however that would suggest that there are redeemable features in the proposed legislation.

This legislation itself is devoid of wisdom, perspective and full of ideological recklessness, that will
remove the progress from the age of enlightenment back to the time of Spanish Inquisitors.

It is beyond belief that a government which wants to promote fairness and equality will create a
protected class whose opinion will be above the individual, it will create nothing less than a tyranny
of the minority.

I query then what type of democracy this government intends to protect; under even the smallest
amount of scrutiny this bill protects an establishment which often promotes its own interests above
those of the common citizen.

Perhaps, it is the cynical Edward Bernay which rings true within the bureaucracy of this country. He
said in his book Propaganda “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and
opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this
unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of
our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,
largely by men we have never heard of”. Sometimes I wonder was this his thought or one molded by
Goebbels.

Broadly, the internet including ‘social media’ should be ushering in a new age of informed citizenry
not a tool for globalism (an objective many of the supporters for this type of censorship aim to
achieve).

Globalism (Corporatism) however is not democracy, by all logic it cannot be, it is not progress, and it
is not inevitable, it is only an inevitable path to serfdom. What is the point of a global consensus and
interconnectedness? it will not stop wars or suffering. All it will do, is further leech an individual’s
agency until all that is left is a cynical grey world for the majority and a fat delusional and indulgent
minority.

An informed citizenry which has, already, as their divine right a freedom to express ideas, blow the
whistle, make mistakes and place the feet to the fire of the powerful are the only ones which can
bring real progress or peace.

The Wright Brothers were not ‘experts’. We would crucify Jesus Christ if he was walking amongst
today and we would still think the Sun revolved around the Earth if these laws are ever to be
considered.

The writers and promoters of this Bill are not the social justice revolutionaries they envision
themselves to be. No, they are Louis XVIII (Not XVI) in all his delusional puggy glory. If it is a
revolution which has been started, then ask yourself how many that have started the revolution,
survived it? Do you think it will be different for you this time? Many are often destroyed but that
they create.

This government intendeds to create a class society enshrined in law where a journalist, government
employee, bank or pharmaceutical executive will be considered more valued and important by
virtue of their status under this bill.

This is a statement by the government that truth is only the possession of the rich and powerful that
others underneath survive only under their graces and must endure their dictate.

It will codify journalists as the modern day stormtroopers that many believe they already are. The
Durham Report into Russian Collision provides an interest insight into the mechanics into how the
Media and Government worked to manufacture an outcome. Let us also not forget NAFO[1] and who
in media which are related to it.

Even its most simplistic economic consequence this Bill will remove entrepreneurship, innovation,
and competition within media landscape, something I am sure appeases many politicians and
bureaucrats quid pro quos with this legacy media.

It will create a country of sheep and a ruling class of wolves.

Now, let’s talk about misinformation and disinformation.

In the old speak this was called intelligence and counterintelligence. I don’t believe that its
importance within government has ever stopped or that media or social media would not be the
perfect medium for such material. We must remember that it’s all for ‘national security’ and the
‘protection of our democracy’.

If deception is war, then what of this bill? A declaration of war against the citizenry of Australia by its
own government?

Make whatever distinction in color you want, but it is still just putting lipstick on a pig. Oh, what are
nudge teams again?

Then to claim election integrity. Spare me your hypocrisy.

Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and decades of claiming illegitimate elections all over the world then Trump
happens, and you collectively spat your Matcha Soy Latte’s over each other. The unwashed had left
the reservation, how dare they!

I am sure that your education included Machiavelli, perhaps it is part of the orientation pack
included with your security pass, where you can park and how many work from home days you
have. I digress.

You probably also know that the Republics of that day would often rig elections to ensure that there
was a continuity of foreign policy for the benefit of the wealthy.

How primitive, we are so much smarter now and we are better people today aren’t we, I mean we
have computers and women work in the workforce and they had religion. Ha, those people were so
backwards then.

Yes, we are more intelligent now. For instance, much of the political class and American corporate
media confidently proclaim that:

“The system is racist, and it must be torn down” but when discussing the elections, (which was
created by the one they wish to tear down) they scream “You cannot challenge elections! That is
racist and threat to democracy!”

A curious mind would say something is off here and it is absolutely the right and the duty of citizens
to call out their suspicions and have their grievances properly adjudicated.

It may then lead a curious mind to think why the government wants these laws? What are they
planning?

As for Health, many in the public health and the revolving door of the pharmaceutical industry
subscribe to Napoleon who once said “It is not necessary to bury the truth. It is sufficient merely to
delay it until nobody cares.”

Perhaps then, COVID was Public Health’s 1812. A self-destruction in credibility.

It was not the ‘noble lie’ in an emergency crisis, it was not the fault of a social media post or
podcaster. The blame always goes on the people that think they know more than anyone else, selfinterested and are entirely delusion of their own capabilities and intelligence.

Can you tell me what the scientific method is again?

It was the government in their wisdom of “better together” they created the “Anti-Vax” slur the
modern day “N-word”.

My only conclusion over that debacle for that Princess Leia was right “The more you tighten your
grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers”. But hey, I guess if you can’t gain credibility
naturally, force it.

Now add the economy and finance system and you could go on forever on the issues which could be
deemed as misinformation or disinformation.

The irony it would appear is in denying the conspiracy of a new world order/ one world government
is that you create another pillar for it with this legislation. Wait, hang on. Is this a conspiracy
anymore?

I mean, would we be banning types of thought around central backed digital currencies? Universal
basic income, artificial intelligence, gas cookers, environmental, social and government policies and
free trade agreements? This legislation unreservedly says yes.

This Bill it is not for the sake of the many but for the existence of the profiting few.

As for hate speech, what a soft underbelly these architects and promoters have and how little
understanding of ‘live by the sword and die by the sword’ as well as ‘if you want to understand
someone walk a mile in their shoes’. This legislation will not bring people together but pull them
further apart, but hey I might be over using my point of privilege here.

Let’s look at how all that hate speech is going in the UK where in the latest buffet of buffoonery the
West Yorkshire Police face a compliant when a teenage autistic girl said the female police office
‘looked like a lesbian’ (as the autistic girl’s grandmother was a lesbian). Thinking the girl was
homophobic the police arrested her[2].

What barbarism! the proposed Australian Bill has very similar language, and proponents spew the
same emotive nonsense as their UK and Irish Counterparts, yet we can see here the what the
outcome will be. A tyranny of the minority.

We already have laws which allow law enforcement and people to have clearly defined boarders in
which all agree are justified for a government to intervene that is, A threat to kill or physically harm

another person, and not to defame a person. Include the sickening fetish of child pornography (or
minor attracted people’s porn) and revenge porn and I think the list is complete.

This Bill is a disgrace, and you should be ashamed of yourself.

Education is the main source of radicalism and often not fit for purpose in today’s age.

If you want to stop online radicalism and terrorism, stop disenfranchising people.

Allow people to talk and express their ideas, regardless of how much you disagree with them.

Don’t make symbols verboten as they become more enticing. Don’t label people until it becomes a
badge of honor.

Educate people to make valued judgements and be critical and professionally skeptical. Become a
worldly population through objective content not dragging children to climate change protests and
only decrying the worst aspects of the British Colonialism.

Your terrorist is someone’s hero, your dictator is someone’s courageous leader. That is and will
always be life.

The only objective of this Bill is to codify this cancel culture. It will end in disaster. For all of us.

This Bill illustrates that the ‘intellectual’ capital within government has lost its moral authority.
History has shown that this will then lead to the next predictable and natural bedfellow. Murder and
suffering, as those with the best intentions will continually fail to understand why they cannot have
the order, peace, and security in their new empire.

Isn’t it amazing how many of these laws are designed to restrict an individual’s agency? Why is it
that? You don’t have a referendum on introducing a bill of rights into the constitution, but I guess
the government is smarter than those ‘American’ authors.

The final irony in my response is that it will (if ever read) be dismissed or held to be the result of
misinformation! I have been radicalized by the internet! I need to be saved from myself!

I will be dismissed as uneducated, unoriginal, of low intelligence, perhaps even privileged or racist,
dehumanized into an existential threat which needs to be irradicated or even prosecuted by a jilted
lover or admirer. After all this is politics and politics ruins everything.
