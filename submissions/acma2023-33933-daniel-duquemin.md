This sounds like a terrible idea.
The lack of freedom of speech/expression over the last few years has been bad
enough without these powers, giving the government these powers is only going to
make things worse.
This will just be used by the various federal, state and local governments to
further eradicate dissent.

My local council (Moonee Valley City Council) has already referenced this bill
in their attempt to silence an anonymous Facebook Page they don't like.
The resolution, '10.1 Notice of Motion No. 2023/26 - Anonymous Misinformation',
occurred on the 8th of August, page 22 of these meeting minutes:

(With part c. making explicit reference to the 'Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation' Bill)

This bill will make it easier for Moonee Valley City Council, and any other
levels of government, to silence online content they don't like.
The authoritarian councillors and parliamentarians in favour of this don't care
about incorrect speech, they only care about speech that proves them wrong or
makes them look bad.
