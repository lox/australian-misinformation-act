### Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting

## Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

### Author:

###### Introduction

Before responding to specific elements of the exposure draft of the Communications Legislation
Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 (henceforth "the Bill") I will
begin with a simple thought experiment;

If this were the turn of the 18th Century, a mere 300 years ago, and the Bill was passed in Europe or
America, then the following would all be "facts" according to the thinking of the time:

###### • Miasma Theory: "Bad air" caused diseases.1

 • Humoral theory: The notion that humans were made up of four substances blood, phlegm,
black bile, and yellow bile and an imbalance caused disease.

###### • The geocentric model: the Earth as the center of the cosmos or universe, and the planets,
the sun and the moon, and the stars circles around it.

###### • Toothworm: the idea that toothache was caused by the presence of a worm inside the
tooth."

###### • Tobacco as a medicinally beneficial treatment

By impeding freedom of speech and expression these ideas would have remained unchallenged and
would likely have remained "facts" to the present day.

Further, any person proposing a new scientific, economic or social theory or hypothesis would be
subject to the scrutiny of a central arbiter of "misinformation and disinformation" and likewise
would have no means to disseminate or test their ideas. Such examples would include theories and
hypotheses such as:

###### • The antiseptic procedures proposed by Ignaz Semmelweis in the mid 19thCentury that were
ridiculed by other medical professionals yet led to dramatic decreases in maternal mortality.

###### • The pasteurisation of milk proposed by Alice Catherine Evans in 1917. Evans was initially
dismissed by the establishment because she was a woman and did not have a Ph.D.
"Evans faced immediate skepticism and severe criticism from scientists, veterinarians and
representatives from the milk industry, who dismissed the idea that she could have made a
discovery that had escaped the observation of other (i.e. male) researchers.

1. Absence of certain sectors in the Bill

There exist organisations and institutions that seemingly fall outside of the defined groups in the Bill.
The "Third sector" which is the voluntary sector, the economic sector consisting of non-governmental
organizations and other non-profit organizations are not referred to in the Bill. These organisations
produce and disseminate large amounts of information digitally and in-person (e.g. The _Safe_ _Schools_
_Coalition_ _Australia_ _(SSCA)_ or _Cool_ _Australia)._ _Cool_ _Australia_ brag on their website of their reach:
_"6.1m+_ _Students_ _taught_
_8,990_ _Schools_ _reached_
_2.1_ _m+_ _Lessons_ _and_ _activities_ _downloaded_
_175,000+Teacher_ _members""_
It is unclear as to whether such organisations fall under the terms of;
"an educational institution accredited by any of the following

(i) the Commonwealth;

(ii) a State;

(iii) a Territory;

(iv) a body recognised by the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory as an accreditor of
educational institutions;"v

_Cool_ _Australia_ states "Currently, our courses are not accredited with NESA in NSW."VI Thus, _Cool_
_Australia_ and other NGO's or voluntary sectors that disseminate information should be subject to the
Bill. This is not clear in the Bill.

Further, public-private partnerships are not referred to in the Bill.

Lastly, supranational organisations are not referred to in the Bill. "Foreign power" is referenced once
but not defined. Again, organisations such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organisation
(WTO) and World Economic Forum (WEF) produce and disseminate vast quantities of information,
these organisations should be subject to the same laws and regulations as everyone else.

2. Government Monopoly on Information

Government and the public service spend vast sums of taxpayers money on collecting, collating,
storing and analysing information and data. Often, this data is not accessible to the public (despite
having paid for it) or is difficult to gain access to, requiring time and / or money and skills (e.g. filling
out Fol's). Thus, Government has quite a monopoly on information.
There have been several notable issues with public agencies collecting data then altering it for
release to the public. A good example is the "homogenisation" of temperatures by the Bureau of
Metereology.

To impose restrictions such as those in the Bill on the general public who do not have the same
access to the data and information available to the Government whilst excluding the Government at
all three levels is completely topsy-turvy. The public do not have coteries of highly paid staff and
entire Departments at their fingertips to conjure up information that politicians do. If anything, the
Government should be held to a far greater degree of responsibility for spreading misinformation
and disinformation. It should be incumbent on Government to tell the truth and be as accurate as
possible.

3. Failure of Government to police itself

With the above in my mind let us consider some examples of Government misinformation and
disinformation.

###### • In 2007 soon-to-be Prime Minister claimed that green energy targets would cost each
person "$1 per person per year".v" This is clearly misinformation as energy costs have
increased by hundreds of dollars per person.

###### • The Gillard Labor Government claimed the NDIS would cost $14 billion a year. It is currently
costing over $30 billionvl".

###### • Tim Flannery, the Climate advisor appointed by the Labor Government, claimed in 2007 that
climate change would mean "So even the rain that falls isn't actually going to fill our
dams and our river systems"lx. As a result State Governments spent billions of dollars
building desalination plants, all but one were later mothballed. Yet in 2010, just three years
later, there were floods in Brisbane and the Wivenhoe Dam overflowed causing 33 deaths
and over $2 billion in damages.

There are thousands of other examples that could be cited, Government is often the greatest
purveyor of misinformation and disinformation. The economic costs of the above few examples have
been astronomical and the social costs have included deaths.

###### 4. Proposal

The Government cannot and should not exclude itself or any other institution from the Bill. In fact
the Government should be leading by example. The Government (including the Civil / Public Service
and any Government funded entities or corporations) must be held to a higher standard on the issue
of misinformation and disinformation than the people. To make this Bill fair and equal the following
should be considered for addition to the Bill:

###### • The public may bring charges of misinformation and disinformation against any Government
official, politician etc. that results in economic, financial or bodily harm. The charges will be
heard and adjudged by Jury selection (the Government cannot be allowed to police itself).

###### • The Government must provide all data it collates and collects to the public in its raw form in
real-time (if possible) except data that may compromise National defence. The data can be
de-identified if necessary (e.g. health data).

Penalties will vary accordingly. I shall provide a few suggestions:

###### • Should a Government project blow out by more than 10%, every member who voted for the
Bill will be docked 10% of their annual salary and the top layer of the civil service involved in
the Budget blowout will dismissed.

###### • Public servants fabricating data or information or transmitting fabricated data and
information should face suspension without pay and / or termination.

###### • Any politician or Government or official coerce a medical intervention that causes harm to
people whilst claiming it is safe and effective should face criminal penalties of up to life in
prison.

5. Conclusion

The Bill is skewed, it is not inclusive, fails to lead by example and it places onerous and costly burdens
on Social Media companies and digital carriage services. Obviously, I do not agree with the Bill
however I see it as a good opportunity for the public to hold their elected officials and the public
servants to account if the Bill is passed with the above proposed amendments. It is time elected
officials and public servants are held to a higher standard in the realm of "misinformation" and

"disinformation". The warning should also be made that those proposing this Bill should be careful of
the machine they are building as one day that machine might be taken over by others who decide
that your information is "misinformation" and "disinformation" and puts you in the firing line of the
weapons you built.
