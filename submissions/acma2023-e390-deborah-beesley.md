To Whom It May Concern
Every Australian has a well-established right to political expression protected by our constitution. A right that
must be ‘protected’.
In democratic countries which are meant to uphold free thought, it is the individual who had the right to decide if
something is misinformation NOT the government.
Albanese’s bill would force social media companies to censor an even greater range of opinions and content than
they already do. Politician are far from perfect. However these censorship rules would NOT apply to content
produced by Federal and State governments, institutions accredited by a foreign government or body recognised by
a foreign government as an accreditor of educational institutions or professional news content.
Thus the Labor government, the media and chosen global elites will be allowed to say and do whatever they want
and Labor’s censorship rules will only apply to everyday Australians like myself.
Misinformation will be determined by faceless bureaucrats who will be empowered to censor anything they say
causes ‘harm’. This legislation could make it a crime to disagree with government policies in everything from
vaccine mandates, men in women’s change rooms to the ‘Voice’ with heavy fines and jail sentences. This Orwellian
proposal is extremely dangerous.
I do not expect this kind of totalitarian overreach, it has no place in Australia. Labor’s shameful efforts to shut
down criticism of their policies, censor legitimate political opinions and act as an authoritarian thought police should
be resisted by ALL Australians.
The best disinfectant to misinformation is free and open speech NOT more government censorship.
Yours Sincerely
