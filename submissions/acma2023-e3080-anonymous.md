Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

I am a mum, wife and hard worker. I have very good critical thinking skills and pride myself on my ability to make good
choices for me and my family. I am not in harms way with a free speech on the internet. But I am convinced the
proposed 'Misinformation Bill’ is wrongheaded and dangerous, putting all Australians that use the internet in harms
way.

Even social media companies such as Meta and Twitter have voiced their concerns over the proposed law because
it’s easy to see how the power given to the ACMA could be abused. Meta said that the law would have a “chilling”
effect on free speech. It would be easy for a government to label as “misinformation” anything that could hurt its
reputation (as many authoritarian governments already do). Giving the government such unrestricted power is
terrifying.

Sorting fact from fiction is not always easy. What someone thinks is true might be what someone else thinks is false.
We need debate and the free flow of information to consider ideas and arrive at the truth. Censoring debate stops this
vital process.

It’s easy to see how governments could abuse these proposed powers to censor truthful content they found
inconvenient. The proposed law can and will do incredible damage if it’s allowed to be passed.

Please reject this proposed law.
