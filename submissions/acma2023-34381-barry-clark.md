Submission - Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Bill

1. This bill stifles freedom of speech, as the government can dictate what they think is right or
wrong

2. This bill puts too much power in the hands of bureaucrats (ACMA)

3. This bill has penalties that are excessive and threatens people for speaking free speech

4. This bill treats citizens as if they canâ€™t think for themselves and that government will make all
decisions about what is wrong or right in society

5. This bill is an insult to Australians as it steals away our right to Human Rights and freedoms
of a democratic society, by using stealth

6. This bill smacks of totalitarianism i.e. what you would see in a dictatorship, not a democracy
