ACMA Submission from Aneeta Hafemeister

The proposed legislation is tyrannical. The last three years have shown that the main source of
misinformation and disinformation is the government and the mainstream media, yet both of these
entities would be exempt under the proposed legislation. This legislation would end free speech in
Australia and with it any semblance of democracy. This legislation must not be introduced.
