I thoroughly disagree with this bill. It is censorship akin to the CCP. Australia is a democracy or it was until this Labor
govt was elected. It seems to me the so called fact checkers are guilty of misinformation as has been this Govt and
the previous govt. The govt is happy for main stream media to broadcast or should I say try to brainwash their
audience with misinformation but not for the audience to respond.
This Bill is purely a reaction from the govt trying to stop the truth getting out. Free speech is a right in a democracy. Its
obvious that the Labor Govt is filled with communists who want to change our way of life
