# It appears that this bill defies common sense, unless you want total control of peoples’ lives, including the free will to discern the truth.

 It is dangerous and beyond belief. It reminds me of how the totalitarian states of the past controlled the masses. Follow ‘their truth’ or suffer the consequences. It is beyond belief that a government would be so deliberately dishonest and attempt to hinder ‘free speech,’ that is very much cherished in democratic company. The fact that this bill may become law and has, like much legislation, been basically hidden from the public, until enacted, shows how ‘low’ government authorities have gone to, in order to get their way. Yes! No wonder there is growing scepticism among Australians.

 Further, when the Federal and State governments are exempt from scrutiny with this legislation, are the Australian people going to ever trust our politicians. Many have violated our trust and very often when the real truth has emerged, still never admit they were wrong

 Why, at this time in history, should ‘the lucky country’ become ‘the country of misery’ because a government deems it cannot deal with apposing points of view or opinions. On the contrary, they fail to give the appropriate arguments to adequately support their position.

 Many Australians, myself included, have lost faith in many of our parliamentarians and the major media outlets, as they have pedalled untruths, half-truths and their opinions; as the so-called truth.  If we believe a government body holds ‘the complete truth’ and anyone who holds a different point of view and goes against the narrative that the ‘authorities’ believe at a particular point in time,

 It is now quite clear that many will give this same example: During the pandemic, the population were led to believe the experimental ‘pretend vaccines’ were ‘safe and effective. The government dictates coerced people into taking their doses to ‘protect the elderly.’ The pharmaceutical companies have admitted under scrutiny that they were not effective, and time is proving they are not altogether safe. Many understood that if they were ‘injected’ they would not get the virus and would not pass it on … this proved to be totally false, yet ‘the untruth’ was pedalled by the so-called experts, the government included and their mouth-pieces; the main-stream media. So, it was both disinformation and misinformation.

# Those elected to parliament to represent us are not there to legislate ‘in secret,’ whatever they wish, without accountability. We expect our elected representatives to be totally open and truthful.

 Further, this bill says to its citizens, “you live in a nanny-state, and we, the government’ must protect you AND we are always right!” It also leads the Australia people down the road to subservience and dependence on our ‘not- so-wise’ elected representatives. It is well known among the researchers who follow the real scientific method that those who call themselves experts are really the opposite. Remember ‘X’ is for the unknown and ‘Spurt’ means a big drip. Those who search for the truth are ‘always looking’ and have great humility. They believe no one holds the ‘whole truth,’ and are always open to contrary opinions.

 In conclusion, this is a dangerous, unnecessary, and dystopian bill that may very well lead to disaster for our democratic society. May God’s Will be done in Australia and not our governments.
