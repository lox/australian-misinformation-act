Regarding the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
# Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is utterly and categorically unacceptable that any corruptible body politic or organisation or individual have power to decide what is true and what is hate/ misinformation for the rest of population, potentially disregarding scientific, and medically peer reviewed and even government statistical proof, and thus polarising the population, leading to war and tyranny. That is depriving said population of any recourse should that decision in fact be manifestly corrupt, deceitful, malevolent, exploitative, neglectful and murderous, as we have seen occur with crystal clarity throughout the so-called ( by corrupt media) "pandemic". The amount of lies told, professionals oppressed and suppressed, harassed; and individuals persecuted and discriminated against; economies and businesses and families destroyed; while Australian Government unbelievably continues promoting a mass psyop which is already known and proved to have injured and killed tens of thousands of Australians, including children, implementing some of the shoddiest and most negligent scientific and medical ethics ever seen in Australia is beyond horrifying.

 Truth belongs to each citizen. Noone has the right to take that away. By doing such, an enlightened democracy becomes a backwards, terrorised tyranny. An horrific crime against humanity is underway globally and removing individuals rights to speak the truth is making the Australian Government continue to be not just an accessory but entirely a systemic, institutional perpetrator of that ongoing crime. No to the proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.
