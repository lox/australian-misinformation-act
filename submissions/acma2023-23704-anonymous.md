I am writing with great concern about the proposed Disinformation Bill. I believe that every person
should have the right to express their thoughts and opinions, without the threat of being bullied into
silence.

Every person should have the right to independently evaluate information and make their own informed
decisions, whether it is in line with the Government views and policies or not.

As a representative of the people, I ask you to carefully evaluate the potential consequences of the
Disinformation Bill on our democracy.

I kindly request that you consider my concerns and use your influence to advocate for a comprehensive
evidence-based approach to addressing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation, one that
protects democracy while ensuring the preservation of our civil liberties.

Thanks you for your attention to this matter, and I trust in your commitment to upholding the values
that define our great nation.

Yours sincerely,
