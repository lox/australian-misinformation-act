**Response to exposure draft of Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting**
**Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023**

This Bill will legalise the censorship of free speech in social media (but not the mainstream media)
which is considered to be “harmful”, but that judgement is open to interpretation.

Who decides what is “harmful”? And who decides what is mis- or dis-information?

Australia has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, since 1948. Article 19
categorically states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information
and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.

Governance in Australia has been captured by powerful elites who control and influence the
mainstream media and major political parties. The power-elites’ vested interests dominate as
Australia has been sold out to corporate globalisation for decades now.

Australia is not an independent and sovereign nation. So the proposed Bill will be slanted to keep
the power elites structures in place and take out opponents who expose corruption.

Examples of real misinformation promulgated by Governments and other media, that were never
challenged/censored but should have been:
1. “Banks loan deposits”. No they don’t! Most of what we understand as money does not exist
in any form other than as entries on bank statements or figures in computer printouts.
2. “Iraq had weapons of mass destruction”. This was shown to be not so as millions were killed,
maimed or displaced.
3. “Abortions are safe”. Not so. They kill off the preborn. Thousands of great souls who should
be here with solutions for mankind’s problems are gone. Nations that support legislated and
legalised abortions will never prosper as it is not consistent with the Universal Laws of Life.

The big problem in Australia is moral bankruptcy in governance and elsewhere. The proposed Bill will
not be effective and is just a step towards totalitarianism.

Yours sincerely,
Bernie Bourke
