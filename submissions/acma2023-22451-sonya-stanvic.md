# Comments on the draft of the Communications Legislation Amendment


# (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.


What constitutes Misinformation or Disinformation it is not the role of the government


to make a law that will affect our freedom of speech, in this country.


If this Bill is passed the  result of this draconian action put forward by the


Government/ Bureaucracy over its citizens will have the opposite effect on the spirit


of a free and educated people and it will stifle rational discussion and in many cases


opposing views.


Something that has only ever happened in totalitarian regimes such as the Nazi


Party, some Communist and some religion based regimes in the middle east.


There are many ways of looking at anything.  Witness the current controversy


regarding Women's Sport. These matters must be allowed to be discussed without


the threat of Government fines and worse.


We need look no further than the disgraceful actions of Governments during the


CoVid saga.


**Finally, I note that the bill expressly exempts the Government and its**


**bureaucracy from punitive action should the bill become law.**


Quite a telling barometer of what the bill - if it becomes law - will ultimately become.


**I am disgusted that the  Federal government wants to push this through.**


In closing If it has not become obvious I totally reject this Bill and urge you to NOT


proceed with it. I think Australians will not be happy  if it is passed.
