I am a concerned Australian citizen who has been privileged to have been a teacher, wife, mother and now a Grandmother.
Growing up in the 50's we were taught about our 'Land of the Free' and a Government that was here to serve all the people. This
meaningful democracy requires that all the people are free to express their thoughts and opinions in the public square. In the
proposed 'Misinformation Bill', the government is communicating to the Australian people that it distrusts the public but has full
confidence in its own ability to determine the truth. Such an ‘us and them’ mentality is undemocratic and will prove devastating
for our country.

The government should trust the Australian public with the responsibility to discern fact from fiction, not take that responsibility
away. An informed and discerning public is the answer, not a ‘Big Brother’ government that shields its citizens from ideas.
Australians must exercise critical thinking skills, not let the government do the thinking for them. Censoring voices from social
media platforms is a direct threat to the democratic process.

As our representative are you on the side of us and voting against this Bill?
