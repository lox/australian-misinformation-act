- I am writing to oppose the “Mis-Information “ Bill proposed by the federal Government.

- Free speech is a hallmark of a democracy. The ability of any citizen to express their opinions within reasonable
limits of defamation and avoiding hateful and abusive language has been an essential component of our democracy
for many years.

- And it works!

- Truth always triumphs eventually in public discourse.

- Now citizens are to be muzzled. The faceless bureaucrats of the Australian Communications and Media Authority
are to be empowered to restrict free speech in accordance with their own judgements on social media platforms.
These bureaucrats have no claim to infallibility as to what is true and what is not.

- The Australian Government is exempted from the legislation.

- Why?

- The conventional media are also exempt.

- Why?

- It is true that wild comments circulate on social media. But as our experience during the Covid pandemic proves,
most people were not swayed by such comments.

- Government should trust the common sense of the people.

- When free speech is restricted beyond reasonable limits, we end up with Putin’s Russia or Xi’s China. We don’t
want to go there.

- The Labor Party has a long and proud history of promoting democracy and free speech.

- Let’s keep it that way.

- Scrap the Bill and get on with running the country as you were elected to do.

- Yours faithfully,

- Joseph de Bruyn.
