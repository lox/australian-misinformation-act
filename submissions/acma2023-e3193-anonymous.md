Dear Misinformation Bill Review,

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a
non-negotiable human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very
subjective. What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear
for their own good. It is simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

I think it is incredibly offensive that the government thinks that truth can only be defined by Politicians, Main Stream
media outlets and universities (which all seems to be exempt from the reach of this bill).

Also it is evident to me that governments (who by definition are in a position of power) are not good arbiters of truth
but have their truth telling polluted by their own personal interest.

Social media is indeed the public square and the disgraceful censoring during Covid has been show to in fact be
censoring of true science.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This
proposed bill is an extreme version of this. I urge the Labour Party to return to the sensible position of free speech
which would have characterised the party of old. Ultimately this can only turn out badly for Labour.
