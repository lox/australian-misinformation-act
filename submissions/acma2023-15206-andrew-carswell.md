To the Minister for Communications,

As a citizen in a democracy I see it as a non-negotiable, inalienable right for my government to allow
me, and encourage me, to voice my opinion on any matter I see fit to have an opinion on. If the
government of the day happens to disagree with my opinion I still expect them to support my right
to voice it. The misinformation and disinformation bill aims to restrict my freedom of speech and is a
disgrace.

I realise that I'm not citing high-faluting legal arguments but on this one I don't think I need to. This
bill goes against the fundamental and self-evident right of every citizen in a democracy to voice his
opinion.

Australian governments have never sunk lower.

Yours sincerely,

Andrew Carswell
