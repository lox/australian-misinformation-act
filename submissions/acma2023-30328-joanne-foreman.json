    "Overall Position": "Oppose",
    "Key Arguments": [
      "The legislation grants excessive power to ACMA, allowing it to determine what is true or reasonable information, which could curtail free speech.",
      "The bill could lead to self-censorship by digital platforms due to the threat of hefty fines.",
      "Existing laws already address issues like discrimination and should target the source of harm, not digital carriers.",
      "The bill undermines the fundamental right to free speech and the implied right of political communication.",
      "The definitions of harm in the bill are vague and problematic, particularly regarding environmental harm.",
      "The bill could lead to a managed democracy, similar to authoritarian regimes, rather than a rights-based democracy."
