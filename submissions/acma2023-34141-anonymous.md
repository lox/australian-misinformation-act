I would like to express my concerns to the exposure draft of the communications Legislation
Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

Although we have been sold that narrative that ACMA -( Australian Communications and Media
Authority) are doing this for the safety and wellbeing of the Australian people

I have great concerns of what the real long-term impact of this BILL could potentially become.

There should be no enforcement means (penalties) for deemed "misinformation" or "disinformation"

I, as many Australians would like the choice as to what we see, read, hear and say.

I, we would like the freedom of choice to choose for ourselves.

I, we do not feel the government should have this responsibility or ability to decide or dictate for us
the Australian people, what is true and correct.

My concern is who actually defines what is mis or disinformation?

We need greater transparency and less dictatorship to protect our freedom of speech.

We the people should be allowed to have our say, and be allowed to be heard and allowed to decide
for ourselves what is mis or disinformation.

With Regards
