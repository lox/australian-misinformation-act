Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Committee Chair,

This legislation is a dangerous bill to Australian freedom of speech. Yes there is a lot of
dis/misinformation on the internet which needs some control but this legislation has some very large
holes in the language used which as Adolf Hitler did be used to supress any information that the
government of the day wants supressed.

We experienced this when the Covid epidemic was happening and there was anti-vaccination
information on the internet as regards the spike protein vaccines that the government was pushing
everyone to get. Luckily some of us didn’t succumb as now the evidence is coming out that it wasn’t
completely safe and does have long term negative effects on some people contrary to all the
information the government and media were jamming down our throats at the time.

We now see lots of misinformation about the war in Ukraine and the support of a neo-nazi regime in
Ukraine (Azof Battalion) who are in government by our own Australian government by giving them
weapons and money. Why did we bother fighting in WW2 if we are going to support them now. Look
at your history not the propaganda that you are listening to.

The next is the current drive for war with China, just like the Iraq war based on a pack of lies. If the
government of the day chooses the line to follow the US again and start illegal wars and decides to
suppress the real truth how are we supposed to oppose illegal and unjust war.

Hopefully the people will wake up eventually then judge these crimes to jail those in power who
have led us into previous and possible new wars unjustly, in their lifetimes with a bit of luck.

Suppressing the truth is an extremely dangerous tactic and must not be allowed to happen. It’s bad
enough now what the government is getting away with let alone what might happen in the future.

Throw this bit of garbage legislation where it belongs. The truth will set you free, keep it that way.

Yours sincerely

Dennis Pukallus
