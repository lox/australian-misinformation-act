This bill is just another example of attempts by an increasingly totalitarian government to exert more control and
silence both truth and dissent. It should be of concern to any right minded, thinking person when the government
of the day seeks to penalise the free speech of the people who pay their salaries....... those whom they are
supposed to represent. While many people in this country are asleep at the wheel and lack the motivation or
intellect to offer any resistance, there are also many who will not stand for any further encroachment on their
freedom and human rights. I wholeheartedly reject this bill and any attempt to silence the truth and further
advance the systemic corruption and lies which pervade this countries government, institutions and media. I do
not consent!
