I am absolutely amazed that thinking people could even contemplate the proposal of such a bill as the proposed "Misinformation
Bill." My offspring will be committed to crawling into a cave where they communicate with no one
for fear of ever saying a word out of place if this becomes law. Please consider afresh what serious effect a law resulting from this
bill will do to shut down progress because of fear.

This proposed “Misinformation Bill” is disgraceful. Intended or not, it will damage free speech. Free speech is a non-negotiable
human right and must be safeguarded.

The bill states that “misinformation” includes that which leads to ‘harm’, including psychological harm. But this is very subjective.
What someone perceives as harmful, another may perceive as helpful, and something others need to hear for their own good. It is
simply not possible for governments to police such subjectivity.

Australians have felt the encroaching restrictions on what they can and cannot say over the past several years. This proposed bill
is an extreme version of this.

It must be rejected.
