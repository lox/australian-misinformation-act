I am very concerned about the government’s proposed ‘Misinformation and Disinformation Bill’. How does a democracy like
Australia get to the point of having to pass a bill to do with free speech? This is a basic human right.

Who can determine what counts as “misinformation”. What is information to one person may be “misinformation” to another. No
one has a monopoly on truth. It is impossible for a government body to be responsible for making these decisions. Free speech is
needed for us to arrive at the truth.

This is just another ploy for the government to tighten it’s grip on total power of it’s people, It’s happening all over the world and
is part of the Great World Reset.

Reject this authoritarianism.
