## This bill is an infringement on personal freedom of choice
 as it presupposes that Australian adults are unable to discern for themselves what is true. It negates
 independent critical thinking in favour of 'groupthink',
 and creates a culture of fear and censorship that is anathema to our Australian way of life.

 There is no need for the ACMA, or any government
 agency, to regulate the social media posts of any person, on any platform. The only possible reason would be as a control mechanism which is not appropriate legislation in
 a democratic country founded on the principles of representative government.

 We urge the Australian Government to stop the
 Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 on the grounds that this proposed legislation poses a significant
 threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians via
 allowing censorship on our freedom of speech and opinions, as well as being damaging to our society,
 economy, and our culture, where everyone is free to think for themselves.
