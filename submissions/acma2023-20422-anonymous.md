I do not support the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. It is an unreasonable level of censorship.

In a country where we have been led to believe we have freedom there is no place for censorship. If
you feel there is resistance now, this type of Bill will escalate that resistance.

I do not believe, on any point, that there is only one view. Even among experts, in any field, there
will be many points of view. Some will be monetized, some will be ethics driven. For that reason I
don't believe anyone is capable of, or entitled to, determine what is misinformation or
disinformation.

The choice to seek all information, and filter through each person’s individual realm of experience,
allows evolution and growth.

Among adults respectful debate and discussion, around all points of view, allow each person the
freedom to make choices and live in a way that is most effective for the individual, based on the
individual’s beliefs and attitudes. That is what it is to be human.

It is not the Governments' role to decide what information I am allowed to share, nor access, to
make the choices for myself for which I alone am responsible.

It is the Governments’ role to protect my freedom to choose what information makes most sense to
me. As an adult that is my right to choose.
