With regards to the mis and dis information bill, this is a slippery slope to totalitarianism.

This is not about protection of citizens, it is about making sure that any criticism of the Govermment
and their supporters is stifled. The situation where the sitting Government gets to determine what
is true and false and is exempt from the legislation itself, opens a veritable can of worms.

The sitting Government can then effectively eliminate all criticism of its progress and policies, and
also ‘cancel’ or censor any individual, company or political party that threatens it’s stranglehold on
power. Who or what gets to define what is ‘true’? The organization with the deepest pockets and
the most to lose from questioning the current situation?

The past 3 years are an apt illustration of how ‘fact checkers’ can get situations so wrong, with the
‘truth’ at the start of the pandemic, being in hindsight, a totally manufactured reality. Valid scientific
research and experiences and discussion were severely stifled to the detriment of everyone, and
people have been injured and died, and excess mortality is still at unprecedented levels. This is still
being denied, and no one will ask the questions publicly.

With massive fines and jail time on the table, if this bill is passed, mean that this situation can only
get worse.

The other issue with stifling debate and discussion is that there can be no progress, no hindsight, no
free thought, and no democracy. This mean that the status quo will religiously enforced and only
existing ‘approved’ technology, data will be accepted.

Real science and progress welcomes questions and criticisms because that is how it becomes
stronger. Real critical thought is also fostered by free exchange of questions and challenges.
