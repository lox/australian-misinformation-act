The proposal of this Bill is very concerning. Freedom of speech is a fundamental human
right underpinning all free societies, which is what we want Australia to remain!  We want
to protect this freedom in this age of social media.

Currently there is a voluntary framework established by the Australian Code of Practice on
Disinformation and Misinformation. This code has been signed by its members but the
proposed Bill will be giving power to non-signatories to decide what is disinformation or
misinformation. This is a further step towards communism – a minority deciding what will
be so for the majority!

Misinformation and disinformation labels are often used as an excuse to shut down criticism
and dissenting opinions rather than inviting healthy discussion. There have been many times
these labelled opinions have turned out to be true.

Trying to impose ‘big brother’ censorship is the sort of thing governments do when they
want to prevent truth from getting out. Giving ACMA the power to force foreign companies
to censor free speech is open to bribery and favouritism.

The best way to counter misinformation is through respectful debate and history has shown
that the censorship of speech has always been the beginning of authoritarianism bringing
the demise of a nation.
