# Submission for Have your say: New ACMA powers to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platform services

I oppose this Bill because it does not strike an appropriate balance on freedom of speech and
expression. The powers given to ACMA in the Communications Legislation Amendment
_(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 violates the principles of our Australian_
democracy.

According to the Parliament of Australia website [1], Australia is a democracy, and there are six key
principles of our democracy, and this Bill violates three of those principles.

## 1. Respect for and tolerance of opposing ideas

The principle of respect and tolerance says that “In society, listening to different points of view and
the voices of minorities strengthens our democracy” [1]. The Bill is in opposition to this principle
because it proposes that some views and voices will not be respected or tolerated; that they can
be arbitrarily deemed ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’, ‘hatred’ and ‘harmful’, and therefore be
censored.

The Bill’s ambiguous definition of the terms: ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’ and ‘harm’, leave
them wide open to interpretation by those granted decision-making power. The powers given to
ACMA by this Bill have the potential to be abused in order to silence and censor inconvenient
questions and dissenting information or views posted by Australian citizens, whistle-blowers and
independent journalists.

The broad and ambiguous definition of ‘harm’ allows censorship to be applied to anything that
ACMA and government does not like and approve of. For example, citizens posting information
opposing the government’s decision to build a mine, because of their environmental concerns, can
be censored on the basis that it causes “economic or financial harm to Australians, the Australian
economy or a sector of the Australian economy” [2] because the government says building the
mine would be an investment and create jobs. Likewise, people opposing the premature shut
down of coal-fired power plants, because it could harm the economy, could be censored by the
ACMA because their views promote “harm to the Australian environment” [2].

Organising protests on important issues could be censored because it could be deemed a
“disruption of public order or society in Australia”, and independent journalists or whistle-blowers
reporting on real electoral corruption could be silenced on the account that it causes “harm to the
integrity of Australian democratic processes or of Commonwealth, State, Territory or local
government institutions” [2].

Hatred is not defined in the Bill, therefore any criticism online could potentially be labelled
‘hatred’. For example, criticism of religious or medical practices that are objectively harmful to
people could be censored because they are deemed “hatred against a group in Australian society
on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion or physical or
mental disability” [2]. Important debates on topics like abortion, medically assisted dying and
gender ‘affirming’ care could be banned from being discussed online; these discussions could
arbitrarily be deemed ‘harm’ or ‘hatred’ because somebody, somewhere, from some group, might
be offended by critical questions or differing views, and seek to silence any debate.

Examples of the potential abuse of this Bill are endless because it essentially gives ACMA the
power to silence anyone for any reason, and this power violates the key principle of respecting and
tolerating opposing ideas in our democracy.

A listed benefit of our democracy is that we have “the freedom to act, speak and think freely” and
we supposedly value freedom of speech and belief, and tolerate differences and opposing ideas

[1], and yet, this proposed Bill has the power to shut down freedom of speech and enable
intolerance of opposing ideas.

The whole point of freedom of speech is to allow public discussion on important topics, but this
cannot occur if anything can be arbitrarily labelled as ‘misinformation’, ‘disinformation’ or ‘harm’
and be censored as a result. We cannot make informed decisions about any topic if we cannot
access and share different or opposing information on that topic. Giving the government any
powers to regulate speech is dangerous, and such powers have been abused by totalitarian
governments throughout history, which did not end well for the people of those societies. ACMA,
nor any single person, organisation, government or group, should ever have the power to be the
sole arbiter of truth, online or in the physical world.

## 2. Responsible government

The principle of responsible government says that “the Australian Government is accountable to
the Australian Parliament and through the Parliament, accountable to the people” [1]. The Bill is in
opposition to this principle because it proposes that the government is exempt from being
accountable for publishing misinformation. The Bill states “content that is authorised by: (i) the
Commonwealth; or (ii) a State; (iii) a Territory; or (iv) a local government”, or “content produced by
or for an educational institution accredited by” a government, is excluded for misinformation
purposes [2]. If the levels of Australian government are meant to be accountable to the Australian
people, then they cannot be exempt from laws that allow them to be held accountable for tbeir
actions.

One of the benefits of our democracy is that we are supposed to have “government that is
efficient, transparent, responsive and accountable to citizens”[1], but how can this be achieved if
the government exempts itself from the laws it makes?

Additionally, there is meant to be “equality before the law”[1] which is violated by this proposed
Bill because “professional news content”[2] is also excluded content for misinformation purposes.
This can be interpreted in a way that mainstream media outlets also cannot be held accountable
for publishing misinformation, but independent journalists and Australian citizens can be. This is
not “equality before the law”. No one can be above the law in a democratic society, but this
proposed Bill has the ability undermine equality before the law, and government accountability, by
exempting government and professional news outlets from the rules.

This Bill is also problematic in terms of transparency and accountability because of the ambiguity
of the defined terms and their application to online content. ACMA may label and require the
censorship of “content [that] contains information that is false, misleading or deceptive”, but will
they be required to provide specific justification for their claims about specific content? Or can
ACMA label something as ‘misinformation’ or ‘harmful’ simply because the content opposes the
government’s approved talking points?

Will there be any transparency requirements on how ACMA reached the decision that specific
content was misleading, deceptive, or harmful? Or do ACMA get to be the unopposed arbiter of
truth, with no justification required, and with no questioning allowed, or appeal of their decisions
permitted?

Employees at ACMA, making these decisions about what is ‘true’, are not experts in every topic
and cannot be expected to be so. How, then, can they accurately judge something as false,
misleading, deceptive or harmful? It sounds like ACMA employees will have to apply the rules to
online content using very broad criteria, and this blanket application could mean that legitimate
information may be censored. For example, important new scientific research could be
erroneously labelled as false by AMCA if the government hasn’t yet recognised these new findings
as ‘true’ in its official criteria.

Additionally, we have already seen such powers misused by the federal government to silence
factual content that it did not approve of. I draw your attention to an article titled, Banned Covid
_posts 'totally factual', published in the Weekend Australian on 22-23 July 2023._

The article states:

“Many of 4000 social media posts **secretly** **censored** **by government during the height of**
the Covid-19 pandemic contained factual information and reasonable arguments rather
**than misinformation, new documents reveal.**

...

[G]overnment sought the removal of an Instagram post... that claimed “Covid-19 vaccine
does not prevent Covid-19 infection or Covid-19 transmission”. That statement clearly was
accurate yet the official intervention via the Home Affairs Department claimed it breached
Instagram's community guidelines because it was ‘potentially harmful information’ that was
‘explicitly prohibited’ by the platform.

...

[T]he federal government...intervened more than 4000 times seeking the removal of social
media posts by digital giants such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, using the
companies own community standards as its trigger. The information came to light as a
result of FOI applications.” [3]

This news article demonstrates the potential for abuse and error in censorship powers, and the
lack of government transparency and accountability in its exercise of them. This proposed Bill,
formally granting ACMA such powers, poses a threat to our democracy because it goes against the
principle of responsible, accountable and transparent government.

Humans are fallible: they don’t know everything; they are prone to making errors; they are
inherently bias and they are also corruptible – therefore, no single person, organisation or group
should ever be granted the power to be the sole arbiter of truth, online or in the physical world.

## 3. Principle of liberal democracy

The principle of liberal democracy says that “as a nation, we support the development and wellbeing of individuals” and that we have “respect for individuals and their right to make their own
choices” and that we value “all people and [support] them to reach their full potential.” [1]

The proposed Bill is in opposition to this principle because it allows for some information to be
arbitrarily censored, which steals an individual’s ability to freely learn about a topic, by accessing a
broad range of information and viewpoints, so that they can make their own choices. By censoring
information, ACMA removes the ability for Australian people to be fully informed about important
topics, and thus they cannot make fully informed decisions in voting, or in any other areas of their
lives.

Additionally, this Bill has the power to steal people’s ability to speak freely online. Limiting freedom
speech limits an individual’s ability to develop their skills of reasoning, communication and civilised
social interaction. Through freedom of speech online we enable and promote discussions about
important topics that affect our society, and this discussion requires people to:

  - logically evaluate their ideas and position on a topic;

  - practice articulating their ideas effectively to others;

  - learn to receive criticism and handle others’ questions of their views;

  - learn to see the errors or biases in their thinking;

  - learn to consider other perspectives on a topic, and tolerate differences; and,

  - learn to re-evaluate, correct and refine their ideas and views.

In observing and participating in online discussions, individuals also learn important lessons in
social etiquette: how to conduct themselves in a civilised manner when interacting with others.

These lessons in social skills learned in the online space can then be applied to physical world
interactions as well.

As a society, we automatically correct inappropriate social behaviour, and promote appropriate
social behaviour, by giving and receiving feedback on each other’s conduct. We also naturally ask
questions, point out biases and errors in thinking, so that together we can reach logical conclusions
and promote helpful ideas. Thus our society already comes with a natural regulatory function to
correct misinformation and stamp out harmful ideas, and we should enable and encourage
individuals to participate in this process as part of their development, rather than outsourcing this
function to the government. By limiting freedom of speech online, this Bill would steal important
opportunities from the Australian people to develop their critical thinking, communication and
interpersonal skills, which prevents our people from developing their full potential.

Therefore, this Bill violates the principle of liberal democracy. It does this by disrespecting the right
of individuals to make their own choices through its ability to censor alternative views and
information; and, by limiting the development of an individual’s potential through shutting down
free and open discussion online.

In summary, I oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation
_and Disinformation) Bill 2023 and the granting of ACMA any additional powers to decide what can_
and cannot be said online. I oppose this Bill because it is a threat to our democracy, in that it
violates the democratic principles of:

  - respect for and tolerance of opposing ideas (by being able to arbitrarily censor
different/opposing views and ideas);

  - responsible government (by not ensuring equality before the law, and not ensuring
transparent and accountable government); and,

  - liberal democracy (by not respecting individual rights to make decisions, and limiting the
development of their potential).

ACMA should NOT have the powers proposed in this Bill, nor should any other group be given
these powers. This Bill should not be passed into law.
