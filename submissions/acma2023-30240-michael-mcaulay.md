The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023 is ‘a license to censor’ and is a direct attack on one of the
fundamentals of our society, that being Freedom of Speech.

This legislation targets everyday Australians, independent media and non-government
political parties while carving out protections for government, mainstream media and
“other” approved organizations.

It would give the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) draconian
powers to silence critics of the government and impose fines up to $6.8 million on social
media platforms if, in ACMA’s opinion, they have not done enough to prevent the
dissemination of what ACMA considers to be misinformation or disinformation.

One of the main concerns with this bill is its highly subjective definition of what constitutes
misinformation. Basically, misinformation will mean whatever the government wants it to
mean. This could easily include legitimate criticisms of the government, questions about
the science underpinning climate change ideology, questions about high immigration,
questions about gender dysphoria, and statements for the No campaign against the voice
to Parliament.

There are many recent notorious examples of professional news outlets propagating
(wittingly or unwittingly) information that is false, misleading or deceptive, since the focus
of the Bill is the presence of misinformation on ‘digital platform services’ (and not the
regulation of the mainstream news media), it is not clear why professional news content
should be excluded from the concept of ‘misinformation’. The adoption of this bill, will
reinforce Governmental and foreign influence on Australia‘s information space.

Legitimate criticisms of Government as well as differing points of view from the populace,
are excellent indicators and essential foundations of a healthy democracy. The passage of
this bill will erode our democracy.

Opposition to The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 must be made so as to take a stand for
freedom of speech and opinion, ensuring that hard won individual freedoms endure in our
society. Lest we transpire into an Orwellian future where the “Ministry of Truth” governs all!
