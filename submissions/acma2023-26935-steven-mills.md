I am writing to oppose the Exposure Draft Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023.

I totally reject any attempt by the government to control free speech.

These proposed Orwellian style misinformation laws would give the government the power
to force social media companies to remove any posts that, in the government’s opinion, are
misinformation. This is a level of social control between the State and the Private Sector that
comes straight out of 1984 and is totally unacceptable to me.

The government could force social media companies to take down the posts of anyone
criticizing government policy or even force social media companies to remove posts by
elected members of parliament who are in opposition parties or any political attack they
simply don’t like.

Social Platforms would start to self censure any unfashionable opinion and stifle the
legitimate views of Australians.

Posts could be removed solely because they are at risk of being seen as misinformation.

The government should not be the self appointed arbiter of wrong think. And then intervene
legally to ensure we all have the governments approved group think.

The difference between the government’s conspiracy theories and the truth is about 6 months.

I don’t want to accept the governments scary reality of what is or isn’t factual, when the
government so often gets it wrong.

We have seen, recently, how the government is willing to have people arrested in their homes
for harmless posts on social media.

This is government overreach and any government that even tries to implement these laws
should be thrown out of office.

Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy and must be respected by all
institutions.
I am adult enough to take all opinions and information from all sources and make up my own
mind.
