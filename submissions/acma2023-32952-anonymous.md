Subject: Feedback on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting
Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my deep concern and outrage regarding the proposed
# Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and
Disinformation) Bill 2023. As an Australian citizen who values freedom of speech and
the power of the internet as a democratic tool, I strongly believe that this bill infringes
upon our fundamental rights and negatively impacts the voice of regular citizens in
our democracy.

Firstly, the existence of this bill clearly demonstrates a lack of respect for the
freedom of speech of Australian citizens. By creating two classes of citizens, with
one group comprising politicians, journalists, and members of educational institutions
who have the power to spread potentially false or misleading information, while
ordinary citizens are subjected to restrictions, the government undermines the basic
principles of democracy.

The internet has been a powerful democratic invention, giving regular people a
platform to voice their opinions and knowledge. This bill threatens to
disproportionately harm regular citizens who often have valuable insights and
knowledge on various topics. The excessive fines outlined in this bill will lead to
digital services being more restrictive of speech than even the most restrictive
services currently, thereby inhibiting the free expression of opinions and ideas. The
code's application across the entire industry without any "pressure escape valves"
further compounds this harm.

Furthermore, it is impossible to accurately judge what is true or untrue. Information
and knowledge are constantly evolving, with new discoveries often contradicting
previously widely accepted facts. History has shown us numerous instances where
authorities and expert consensus have been proven wrong, as evidenced by the list


-----

# of COVID-19-related information that has been repeatedly revised. Imposing industry
or mandatory codes, as proposed by this bill, could lead to the removal of
information that might later be proven true, hindering open and honest discussions
necessary for finding common ground and uncovering the truth.

Even experts, such as Dr. Nick Coatsworth, who was once a Deputy Chief Medical
Officer of Australia, have expressed serious concerns about the scope and
application of this bill. His statement on Twitter highlights the difficulty in
implementing such legislation and the potential for fines to be levied on information
# that turns out to be accurate or non-harmful.

Additionally, the influence of industry bodies, often funded and stacked by the
biggest players in the industry, raises concerns about the creation of onerous codes
# that impede competition and the entry of new competitors. By granting the largest
digital services the ability to write their own regulations and impose them on smaller
competitors, this bill not only stifles competition but also undermines the free-market
dynamics that have shown evidence of working in the regulation of misinformation
and disinformation.

Moreover, the proposed bill's extraterritorial application and broad definitions subject
foreign entities to Australian laws and industry codes without their knowledge or
representation. This raises issues of jurisdiction and creates an unworkable concept
# that threatens the global nature of the internet. The potential legal risks and
uncertainties for foreign website owners, including potential fines and imprisonment,
are unreasonable and could lead to Australia's isolation from the global internet
community.

Furthermore, the proposed bill's conflict with the News Media Bargaining Code
(NMBC) enacted in 2021 highlights the government's contribution to limiting digital
services' ability to address misinformation and disinformation. By pressuring digital
platforms to pay money to eligible news organisations and designating certain
# content as "covered news content," the NMBC has already compromised the availability of diverse viewpoints. The proposed bill, by hinting at the potential
benefits of fact-checkers and other methods involving news content, contradicts the
limitations imposed by the NMBC and further restricts legitimate discussions on
matters of public policy and scientific investigation.

The proposed bill also undermines the principles of freedom of thought, conscience,
and religion, as well as freedom of opinion and expression, as outlined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By categorizing certain viewpoints, including
those rooted in faith, as misinformation or disinformation, the bill not only restricts
diversity in viewpoints but also fails to recognize the importance of different
perspectives in the democratic sense-making process.

Additionally, the threats and impositions levied upon digital platform providers and
ordinary users, who may be hauled before ACMA, create a climate of fear and
intimidation. The potential reputational damage, financial penalties, and burdensome
reporting requirements imposed on digital platform providers are onerous and may
lead to financial loss or insolvency. Similarly, the threats to ordinary users exposed to
potential harassment and the expectation of dobbing-in on fellow citizens are
# reminiscent of oppressive regimes and contrary to Australian values of mateship and
freedom.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Communications Legislation Amendment
(Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2023 infringes upon the freedom
# of speech, undermines the power of the internet as a democratic tool, and creates a
climate of fear and restriction. This bill, in its current state, represents an
unconstitutional abdication of legislative power and violates the implied constitutional
freedom of political communication. It fails to consider the experiences and
# viewpoints of ordinary Australians while granting excessive power to
government-accredited entities. I urge you to reconsider the provisions outlined in
this bill and prioritize the protection of freedom, democracy, and diversity of
perspectives.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I trust that you will take into account the
concerns raised by many Australians who believe in the principles of democracy,
freedom of speech, and the power of an open and unrestricted internet.

Yours sincerely,
