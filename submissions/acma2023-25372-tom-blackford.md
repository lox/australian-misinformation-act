**Mis-information response**

Why would there be a need now for government to censor and control free speech, only in this time
of covid? We have had social media for approximately two decades prior to covid, but only now the
government wants to control people’s speech to one another. It will just be a method to control the
narrative and stamp out opinions it doesn’t like, while allowing mis-information it does like.

In the last few years, there were many papers published in peer reviewed journals on the topic of
covid. Three hundred have since been retracted, as subsequently they were determined to be
flawed. Yet, leading scientists and medical practitioners complained their papers were no longer
being welcomed by journals through that period. Thus, they had to turn to social media platforms.
Fact checkers declared those ideas were mis-information, despite the high professional standing of
the authors.

Many of their claims have finally been acknowledged, long after they were first promulgated on
social media – eg. Covid vaccines caused injury, in large numbers, especially cardio vascular system;
vaccines did not prevent transmission; lockdowns did great harm, and Sweden managed better than
European countries despite not imposing any measures.

Why was there no government program promoting exercise, fresh air, nutrition, and natural
immunity, than terrifying people and telling them there was nothing to do until a vaccine was ready?
This was all government messaging, and destructive to our community.

If there truly is a pandemic of some pathogen that is novel and there is no known treatment, the
logical response is to have doctors all over the world trying out different protocols and sharing their
results. A thousand protocols would quickly be tried, most of them dismissed, and the best
remaining. Instead, the dominant message was, there’s no treatment, don’t come to hospital unless
you can’t breathe. Instead, clinicians around the world were communicating early treatment with
existing medicines that were beneficial and lifesaving. Any people who are given the task of
censoring information, are only going to threaten truth seeking.

Falsehoods need sunlight shone onto them, and discussion, so many opinions can be aired and
considered. The truths will outlast the lies. If the media are controlled so opinions and discussion
are curtailed, only then can falsehoods win.

Censorship is the path to totalitarianism.
